'''Chinese five spice powder''' (&amp;#20116;&amp;#39321;&amp;#31881; or '''five spices powder''' or '''five-spice powder''') is a convenient seasoning for [[Cookbook:Cantonese cuisine|Cantonese cuisine]]. It incorporates the five basic flavours of Chinese cooking - sweet, sour, bitter, pungent, and salty.
It consists of [[Cookbook:China Tung Hing Cinnamon|China Tung Hing cinnamon]], powdered [[Cookbook:Cassia|cassia]] buds, powdered [[Cookbook:Star anise|star anise]] and [[Cookbook:Anise|anise]] seed, [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger root]], and ground [[Cookbook:Clove|clove]]s.
Another recipe for the powder consists of [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]], [[Cookbook:Black Pepper|black pepper]], cloves, [[Cookbook:Fennel|fennel]] seed, and star anise.  It is used in most Cantonese roasted [[Cookbook:Duck|duck]]s, as well as [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] stew.

The formulae are based on the Chinese philosophy of balancing the yin and yang in food.
A pinch of the powder goes a long way.

Although this spice is used in restaurant cooking, many Chinese households never use it in day-to-day cooking.

A versatile seasoned salt can be easily made by stir-frying common [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] with five spice powder under low heat in a dry pan until the spice and salt are well mixed.

== Ingredients ==
* 2 teaspoons Szechuan peppercorns
* 8 star anise pods
* 1/2 tsp ground cloves
* 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
* 1 tablespoon ground fennel

== Procedure ==
#Roast two teaspoons of Szechuan peppercorns in a dry frypan for about three minutes.
#Grind the peppercorns in a pepper grinder or coffee grinder together with 8 star anise pods.
#Strain the ground spices to remove any larger bits.
#Mix together 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves, 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon, and 1 tablespoon ground fennel seeds.
#Grind the completed mixture until it is a very fine powder.
#Use sparingly, as it is extremely pungent.

{{recipe}}

'''Herb Bubble Bread''' is nice type of bread which is a good accompaniment to any meal.  This for a bread maker dough setting.

''Note'': All ingredients should be at room temperature (70-80°F/21-27°C).

==Dough==
*Water, 4 ounces
*Milk, 4 ounces
*Salt, 1 teaspoon
*Large egg, beaten, 
*Butter or margarine, 2 tablespoons
*Sugar, 1 tablespoon
*Bread flour, 2 1/2 cups
*Active dry yeast, 2 1/4 teaspoons

==Herb Mixture==
*Butter or margarine, 1/4 cup
*Paprika, 1 teaspoon
*Parmesan cheese, grated, 1/4 cup
*Garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon
*Dry onion, minced, 1/2 teaspoon
*Ground savory, 1/8 teaspoon

==Procedure==
Measure all ingredients for the dough into the bread pan.  Set your bread maker to the dough setting.  Take out after the dough is finished in the bread maker.

In a small bowl combine the herb mixture in the order listed.  Preheat oven to 350°F/180°C.  Divide the dough into 12 to 16 equal parts and roll into balls.  Dip each ball into the herb mixture and arrange in greased loaf pan.  Cover with a cloth and let it rise in a draft free place until doubled about 30 minutes.  Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until brown.

==Notes==
Cooking times may vary between various models of ovens.

Also this dough can be made into 12 to 16 rolls/buns, six to eight mini loaves, or one regular sized loaf of bread.

Now to cut the cooking time in half, preheat oven to 400°C.  Then bake for 15 minutes and your rolls/buns or mini loaves will come out golden brown.  You might want to cook it slightly longer for a regular size loaf of this bread.

Another small note is that you can use all puprose flour if you don't happen to have bread flour.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Barbecue|Barbecue]] | [[Cookbook:Meat|Meat]]

'''Barbecued Spare Ribs''' are a classic [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|American]] barbecue meal, made from pork.  This version is cooked in the oven, not on a barbecue, and uses a [[Cookbook:Barbecue Sauce|barbecue sauce]] with a distinct [[Cookbook:East Asian cuisines|Asian]] flavor, featuring soy sauce, rice vinegar, and garlic.

==Ingredients==
*2 pounds [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] [[Cookbook:Spare Ribs|spare ribs]] 
*1/4 cup [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]] 
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]] 
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Hoisin Sauce|hoisin sauce]] 
*2 tablespoons white [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
*1 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Sake|sake]] 
*2 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], minced 
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] 
*1/4 teaspoon of freshly ground white [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Stock|pork stock]] 
* freshly ground [[Cookbook:Black Pepper|black pepper]] and [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste

==Procedure==
#Place spare ribs in a large baking dish in one layer. In a small bowl, combine the remaining ingredients. Pour over spare ribs and coat on both sides. [[Cookbook:Marinate|Marinate]] overnight, [[Cookbook:Basting|basting]] occasionally.
#Preheat the oven to [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|375°F]]. Place a large, shallow [[Cookbook:Roasting Pan|roasting pan]] on the oven bottom. Fill with 1/2 inch water. Place spare ribs on a roasting rack. 
#Roast ribs for 45 minutes. 
#Raise oven temperature to [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|450°F]], and roast for 15 more minutes. 
#Serve hot or cold.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Alternatively, Bake at [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|375°F]] for 20 mins then lower the temp to [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|325°F]] for 1 hour; this renders most of the fat and produces very tender meat.

==Ingredients==
===Recipe 1===
*2 sticks (½ lb / 225 grams / 1 cup) [[Cookbook:butter|butter]], softened 
*¾ cup (180ml) granulated white [[Cookbook:sugar|sugar]]
*¾ cup (180ml) packed [[Cookbook:brown sugar|brown sugar]]
*2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:vanilla extract|vanilla extract]] 
*2 extra large [[Cookbook:egg|egg]]s
*2 ¼ cups (600ml) [[Cookbook:flour|all-purpose flour]] 
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:baking soda|baking soda]]
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:salt|salt]] 
*2 cups (480ml) (12-ounce package) [[Cookbook:Chocolate chip|Semi-Sweet Chocolate Morsels/Chips]]

===Recipe 2===
Another variant (using the same procedure) is:

*½ lb. (225g) unsalted butter, softened
*5 ½ oz (160g) brown sugar
*5 oz (150g) granulated sugar
*½ to 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
*2 large eggs
*9 ½ oz. (250g) all-purpose flour
*1 teaspoon baking soda
*1 teaspoon salt
*1 teaspoon dry ground [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]] or [[Cookbook:Orange|orange]] peel (optional)
*10-12 oz. (300g) semi-sweet chocolate chips
*5 oz. (150g) chopped nuts (optional)

==Procedure==
#Preheat oven to 375° F,or 350°F (around 190°C to 176°C) if you want it chewy.
#Cream butter, margarine, granulated sugar, and brown sugar in a large mixer bowl.  Add eggs one at a time, beating until fully incorporated. Add vanilla extract and beat in.
#In a small bowl, sift together the dry ingredients (except chocolate).  Add to the wet mixture in two parts and fold until combined. (If you beat this too long, you may get some [[Cookbook:Gluten|gluten]] formation which will change the cookie texture).
#Stir in chocolate morsels (chips).  Some recipes suggest stirring in a cup of chopped walnuts; please be considerate of people with nut allergies by mentioning the nuts if you use them.
#Drop by rounded tablespoons onto ungreased baking sheets.  There should be enough fat in the cookie dough to prevent sticking, but using parchment paper or non-stick pans may help if you find this not to be the case.
#Bake in the preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden brown (cooking times may vary). Let stand for about 1 minute and remove from hot baking sheet to cool on a wire rack.

==Notes, Tips, and Variations==
*The quality of the flavoring ingredients makes a great difference in the outcome.  Using top-quality butter,  chocolate, and vanilla will produce a superior cookie.
*If you want to use regular flour, as well as butter, the trick is to increase the amount of flour to 3+ cups, which should result in a fairly stiff dough, that will not spread out very much. This trick even works with whole wheat flour.
*Use cake flour instead of all-purpose, replace granulated sugar with brown sugar and use butter instead of margarine. Using cake flour and brown sugar allows you to use butter without fear of your cookies becoming puddles (which is the only reason to use margarine in the first place).
*Some people also recommend chilling dough before baking, though this is usually not necessary. 
*If vanilla extract is not readily available, substitute two teaspoons of vanilla sugar for granulated sugar.
*Using chopped bar chocolate instead of pre-formed chips will result in a more rustic texture -- just make sure the pieces are small enough to eat comfortably.
*The proportion of granulated to brown sugar may be adjusted to suit taste.
*Do not stack hot cookies otherwise they will bend out of shape.

#Prepare the instant potatoes or stuffing according to the package directions.
#On a small pan lay out your frozen biscuits allowing them to touch one another. At this point the turkey breast should have been cooking for 30 minutes.
#Place your biscuits on the lower rack. The biscuits will cook just fine with the turkey in the oven and will be ready in 25&amp;ndash;30 minutes. Check them at 20 minutes to be sure they do not burn.   
#Finish preparing your instant potatoes or stuffing, instant gravy, and vegetables. Place them in serving dishes if desired. Place the cranberry sauce in a serving dish. If you are serving pie along with the dinner you will also need to place the pie on a serving dish. If a frozen pie has been purchased, follow the microwave directions.
#At the end of the hour, remove the turkey. It is recommended that you use a food thermometer to make sure it has achieved a temperature of 160°F &amp;mdash; the minimum temperature necessary to kill any bacteria which have survived the freezing process. Remove the turkey and serve.

This dinner serves 6&amp;ndash;8 people comfortably.

== Leftovers ==

There are many uses for the leftover turkey.  Sliced turkey leftovers can be used to make sandwiches or [[Cookbook:Turkey Biscuit|turkey biscuits]].

The portion along the bone can be used to prepare turkey soup by placing it in a soup pot along with 4 cups of water, 1 chopped onion, 2 tablespoons salt, and pepper to taste.  Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and allow to simmer for 2 hours.  Add another cup of water, spices to taste, desired vegetables such as carrots or potatoes, and noodles. Simmer for an additional hour and a half.

== SAUCES ==

===Common Sauce===

From the 1881 Household Cyclopedia 

Soak slices of veal, ham, onions, parsnips, 2 cloves of garlic, 2 heads of cloves, then add broth, a glass of white wine, and 2 slices of lemon; simmer it over a slow fire, skim it well, and sift it.

===Parson's sauce===

From the 1881 ''Household Cyclopedia''

Chop lemon-peel very fine, with 2 or 3 pickled cucumbers, a bit of butter, salt, and coarse pepper, a little flour, with 2 spoonful of catsup, and stew it on the fire without boiling. 

===Nonpareil sauce===

From the 1881 ''Household Cyclopedia''

Take a slice of boiled ham, as much breast of roasted fowl, a pickled cucumber, a hard yolk of an egg, one anchovy, a little parsley, and a bend of shallot, chopped very fine; boil it a moment in good catsup, and use it for meat or fish. 

===Gravy cakes===

From the 1881 ''Household Cyclopedia''

Chop 2 legs of beef in pieces, put them into a pot of water, stew it over a slow fire a day and a night; then add onions, herbs, and spices as for gravy; continue stewing it till the meat is off the bones, and the gravy quite out; then strain the liquor into a milk-pan, to which quantity it should be reduced; when cold, take off the fat, put it into a saucepan, and add whatever is required to flavor it; simmer it on a slow fire till reduced to about 12 saucers twothirds full, put them in an airy place till as dry as leather, put them in paper bags, and keep in a dry place. 

===Sailor's sauce===

From the 1881 ''Household Cyclopedia''

Chop a fowl's liver with a or 3 shallots, and a couple of truffles or mushrooms; simmer these in a spoonful of oil, 2 or 3 spoonful of gravy, a glass of wine, a little salt and coarse pepper, simmer it about half an hour, and skim it very well before using. 

===Queen's sauce===

From the 1881 ''Household Cyclopedia''

Simmer crumbs of bread in good gravy, until it is quite thick, take it off the fire, and add a few sweet almonds pounded, 2 hard yolks of eggs, and a breast of fowl roasted, all pounded very fine; boil a sufficient quantity of cream to your sauce, and sift all together, then add pepper and salt, and warm it without boiling.

===Catsup for sea-stores===

From the 1881 ''Household Cyclopedia''

Take a gallon of strong stale beer, a pound of anchovies washed from the pickle, the same of shallots peeled, 1/2 an ounce of mace, 1/2 an ounce of cloves, 1/4 of an ounce of whole pepper 3 or 4 large races of ginger, and 2 quarts of large mushroom flaps, rubbed to pieces. Cover these close, and let it simmer till half wasted. Then strain it through a flannel bag; let it stand till quite cold, and then bottle it. This may be carried to any part of the world; and a spoonful of it to a pound of fresh butter melted, will make a fine fish sauce, or will supply the place of gravy sauce. The stronger and staler the beer the better will be the catsup. 

''Another'' -- Chop 24 anchovies, having first boned them; put to them 10 shallots cut small, and a handful of scraped horse-radish, 1/4 of an ounce of mace, a quart of white wine, a pint of water, and the same quantity of red wine, a lemon cut into slices, 1/2 a pint of anchovy liquor, 12 cloves, and the same number of peppercorns. Boil them together till it comes to a quart, then strain it off cover it close, and keep it in a cold dry place. Two spoonful of it will be sufficient for a pound of better. It is a good sauce for boiled fowls, or, in the room of gravy lowering it with hot water, and thickening it with a piece of butter rolled in flour. 

===Cream sauce for a hare===

From the 1881 ''Household Cyclopedia''

Run the cream over the hare or venison just before frothing it, and catch it in a dish; boil it up with the yolks of two eggs, some onion, and a piece of butter rolled in flour and salt. Half a pint of cream is the proportion for two eggs. 

===Sweet sauce===

From the 1881 ''Household Cyclopedia''

Mix together one tablespoonful of moist sugar, two of French vinegar, three of salad oil, a teaspoonful of mixed mustard, some pepper and salt, end serve.

'''Loukoumas''' is a Greek fried pastry, similar to a doughnut.

==Ingredients==
* 1.36 kg (48 oz. = 6 cups) [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla extract]]
* 2 cups undiluted [[Cookbook:Condensed milk|evaporated milk]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* [[Cookbook:Soy Oil|soy]] or [[Cookbook:Corn Oil|corn oil]] for frying
* 4 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Yeast|dry yeast]] dissolved in half a cup of warm water
* ground [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
* 4 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]s
* [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

==Procedure==
# In a large mixing bowl, mix the flour, salt, milk, eggs, baking powder, sugar and vanilla. 
# Mix the yeast and water together. 
# Add the yeast mixture to the other ingredients and stir.  The mixture should look like smooth cake batter. 
# Cover the bowl and leave it for four hours. 
# Place five centimetres of oil in a pot and heat it up. 
# With a tablespoon drop the mixture in and roll. Loukoumades should be sphere-shaped, fried and should look golden or brown from all sides. 
# After they are fried, remove them and pour honey over them. Use the cinnamon for extra flavour. You can also use sesame seeds for flavour.

==Warnings== 
* Always be careful cooking with hot oil. Even though it is very good, it is dangerous.

'''MrsFalafel's Ale, Mustard and Winter Vegetable Pie''' is a [[Cookbook:Vegan cuisine|vegan]] [[Cookbook:Pie|pie]].

==Ingredients==
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*2 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], crushed
*1 [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]], finely [[Cookbook:Dice|diced]]
*½ [[Cookbook:Parsnip|parsnip]], diced
*1 [[Cookbook:Leek|leek]], cut into fine rings
*5 [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushroom]]s, sliced
*¼ - ½ cup dried soya chunks ([[Cookbook:Textured Vegetable Protein|textured vegetable protein]])
*½ tablespoon [[Cookbook:Marmite|Marmite]] or [[Cookbook:Vegemite|Vegemite]]
*200 ml boiling water
*2 heaped tablespoon [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*2 heaped tablespoon wholegrain [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]] (try Gordon's Green Peppercorn Mustard)
*200 ml rich, dark [[Cookbook:Ale|ale]] (try Pitfield Brewery's 1850 London Porter)
*black [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste

For the mash topping:
*1 [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]], [[Cookbook:Chop|chopped]]
*½ parsnip, chopped
*½ small [[Cookbook:Turnip|turnip]] or [[Cookbook:Rutabaga|rutabaga]], chopped
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]

==Procedure==

#Reconstitute the soya chunks: in a bowl, mix soya chunks, the 200 ml boiling water and Marmite, and let sit.
#Prepare the mash topping:  drop the potato, turnip or rutabaga, and ½ parsnip in a [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]] of rapidly boiling water (this quickly destroys the enzymes that would otherwise have a detrimental effect on the vitamin content).  Bring back to the boil and simmer until potato is soft (about 20 minutes). When cooked, drain off the water, add the margarine and [[Cookbook:Mashing|mash]] until creamy smooth. Set aside.
#Put olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat and add the leek, garlic and carrot and ½ parsnip and [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sauté]] until the carrot is soft.  Then add the mushrooms and cook a minute or two more.
#Add the flour and stir like mad for a solid 30 seconds. Still stirring, add the soya chunks and their soaking broth to soak up the flour and thicken. Then add the mustard, ale and some black pepper. Stir to mix all very well. Simmer for about 10 minutes to thicken the sauce.
#Pour into a [[Cookbook:Casserole (pot)|casserole]] dish, top with the potato/rutabaga/parsnip mash, smooth over, and bake at 180°C (350°F) for 20 to 30 minutes or until top is beginning to brown. Remove from oven, let rest a minute, then serve.

This is excellent hearty autumn and winter fare and very tasty.

'''Pumpkin pie''' is a traditional American holiday dessert. It consists of a pumpkin-based custard baked in a single pie shell. The pie is traditionally served with whipped cream.

==Ingredients==
*2 cups (480ml) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]], scalded
*2 cups (450g) [[Cookbook:Pumpkin|pumpkin]], cooked and [[Cookbook:Strained|strained]] (or plain canned pumpkin)
*1 cup (240ml) [[Cookbook:Maple syrup|maple syrup]]
*1/8 cup (30g) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1 Tbsp. [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*&amp;frac12; tsp. [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*1/4 tsp. [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]] (optional)
*2 large [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]], beaten
*1 unbaked nine-inch [[Cookbook:Pie Crust|pie shell]]

==Procedure==
#Preheat oven to 180 °C (350 °F).
#Blend all ingredients, except the pie shell, together.  
#Pour into the unbaked pie shell.  
#Bake at 180 °C (350 °F) for 45 minutes.  
#Let cool and serve.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
[[Image:Pumpkin Pie.jpg|thumb|right|Pumpkin pie]]
*This recipe replaces much of the [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] normally found in a [[Cookbook:Pumpkin|pumpkin]] [[Cookbook:Pie|pie]] recipe with [[Cookbook:Maple syrup|maple syrup]].  Use only real 100 percent maple syrup, not maple-flavored pancake syrup, as their sugar content is different. You can also use brown sugar instead of maple syrup.
*:''Note [[#Substitutions|substitutions]], below.''
*Prepare the raw pumpkin by skinning and cutting into 1&quot; cubes. Bake at 350 °F (180 °C) for an hour and then turn off the heat. Leave the pumpkin in the oven for another hour or two, this will reduce the moisture content. The pumpkin may also be steamed but may end up with too much moisture, resulting in a runny pie. A 10&quot; (25cm)-diameter pumpkin will make 4 to 6 pies. The pumpkin may also be baked whole and skinned afterwards.
*Pumpkin pie has no top crust, which makes most forms of decoration impossible, but for a more aesthetically-pleasing pie, put dollops of real [[Cookbooks:Whipped cream|whipped cream]] on each slice, or add a decorative rim to the side crust with artfully layered dough cut-outs, in the shape of fall leaves, squash or pumpkins.
*Variant: Chocolate-covered pumpkin pie
**After the pie has cooled, melt 2 oz. (55g) of sweetened [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]] (milk or dark) and pour over the top of the pie.  Be sure to completely cover the pumpkin.  Refrigerate to set the chocolate.

===Substitutions===
* 14 oz. (1 can) [[w:Sweetened condensed milk|sweetened condensed milk]] can replace the scalded milk and maple syrup.
* 2 cups of plain canned pumpkin can replace the cooked and strained pumpkin.
*: Do not use &quot;pumpkin pie filling&quot;, which has added spices.
*: For a discussion on the use of canned pumpkin and the recipes attached, please see [[Cookbook Talk:Pumpkin Pie|the talk page]].

'''Crème brûlée'''

''See also: [[Cookbook:Crème Brûlée 2|Recipe #2]]''

These instructions should provide a crackly crust over a cold [[Cookbook:Custard|custard]], balanced in sweetness, [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] and [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]] content.  Few can resist its light, silky texture.  The procedure is due to Dawn Yanagihara [2].

With the oven rack adjusted to its lower middle position, preheat the oven to 300° F (150°C).  Fold a kitchen towel to cover the bottom of a large roasting pan and arrange 12 five-ounce (150 ml) ramekins on the towel.  The ramekins should not touch each other, or the side of the roasting pan.  If the roasting pan is not large enough, scale down the recipe.

Combine 3 cups of the cream and sugar in a medium saucepan.  With a paring knife, halve the vanilla beans lengthwise and scrape the seeds into the saucepan.  Submerge the pods in the cream.  Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar.  Remove the saucepan from the heat and steep the mixture for 20 minutes to infuse the flavor.

Meanwhile, separate the eggs, placing the yolks in a large bowl and storing the whites for another use.  Bring a kettle of water to a boil.  After the cream has steeped remove the pods and stir in the remaining 3 cups of cream to cool the mixture.

Whisk the egg yolks until they are evenly combined.  Add a cup of the cream mixture to the yolks and whisk until combined.  Continue adding cups of cream and whisking until evenly colored.  Pour the mixture through a fine mesh strainer into a second bowl.  Ladle the mixture into the 12 ramekins.

Place the roasting pan onto the oven rack and pour in boiling water until it reaches 2/3 the height of the ramekins. Do not splash water into the ramekins.  Bake until an instant-read thermometer registers 170 to 175°F (77 to 79° C) or until the edges of the custard are set, with a spot in the center about the size of a quarter remaining wiggly.  The baking time depends upon the height of the ramekins.  If shallow, start checking at 30 minutes.  Higher ramekins can take up to an hour to bake.

Remove ramekins from roasting pan and cool to room temperature on a wire rack.  Place on a shallow tray, cover with plastic wrap, and chill in the [[wikipedia:refrigerator|refrigerator]] for at least 4 hours.  Before serving, uncover the ramekins and soak up any condensation with paper towelling.  Spread 1 teaspoon turbinado (Demarara) sugar on each, tilting and tapping to spread the sugar evenly.  Spread sugar only on the number of ramekins that will be served.  The others can be stored for several days in the refrigerator for later use.

Ignite a [[wikipedia:propane|propane]] [[wikipedia:blowtorch|blowtorch]] and caramelize the sugar on each ramekin.  Take care to direct the flame away from any ignitable material.  Avoid the miniature [[wikipedia:butane|butane]] torch since its flame is not adequate for uniform caramelization in a reasonable amount of time.  Re-chill the ramekins for not more than 45 minutes.  A longer time leads to softening of the caramelized crust.

Serve and enjoy!

==Notes, tips and variations==
* Without a torch the sugar may also be caramelized in these ways:
** After spreading the sugar over the ramekins, place them as close as you can under a very hot broiler. Watch them closely because this method tends to be uneven and burn.  Too long under the broiler can also result in the custard turning into a sort of chunky soup which is not a very appealing texture. Works best with fine granulated sugar.
** Heat the sugar in a saucepan over medium heat without stirring until it starts to melt, then stir with a wooden spoon  until caramelization occurs (this is easier to tell with white sugar than Turbinado) and spoon over the ramekins, tilting and rotating them to cover with an even layer.
** Alternately, combine the sugar with half as much water by volume, bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, and cook without stirring 3 to 5 minutes, tilting the pan as required to ensure even caramelization. If the caramel hardens due to cooling, warm over low heat until it is again pourable.

Pesto can be used as a [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce]] for pasta or meat, or can be used as an ingredient in a variety of dishes.  One classic use is to spread the pesto onto slices of bread which are then toasted.

The following recipe substitutes [[Cookbook:Romano Cheese|Romano cheese]] for the usual [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan]].

==Ingredients==

*4 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]]. fresh [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]] (100g)
*approx. 8 oz. [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|extra virgin olive oil]] (200g)
*1/3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] freshly grated [[Cookbook:Pecorino Romano Cheese|Pecorino Romano]] cheese (In all cases, good quality [[Cookbook:Parmesan cheese|Parmesan cheese]] may replace the Pecorino for a milder taste). Crumbled feta cheese also works well for a different taste.
*1/4 cup [[Cookbook:Pine nut|pine nuts]] (optional)
*4 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
*fresh ground pepper and salt to taste

==Procedure==
Preheat the oven to [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|425 °F (220 °C)]].  In an ovenproof pan, [[Cookbook:Roasting_nuts|toast]] the pine nuts for 10&amp;ndash;15 minutes, checking every 5 minutes to prevent excessive browning or burning.  In a small frying pan (skillet), heat 2 tbsp of the olive oil on medium heat.  Crush the garlic and [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sauté]] in the oil until soft, about 2&amp;ndash;3 minutes.  Combine the basil, garlic, cheese and pine nuts in a [[Cookbook:Food Processor|food processor]] or [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]] and chop finely.  While the processor is still running, slowly add the remaining oil to reach a paste-like consistency.

The sauce can be used immediately, covered with a thin layer of olive oil and refrigerated in an airtight container for one week, or frozen for several months. The cheese can be omitted to allow longer storage, as it is the most likely ingredient to spoil.  Grated cheese is then added right before use.

It's possible to store it in jars for longer, but it's advisable to add a little extra olive oil on top of the filled jar, otherwise the top of your pesto will turn brown as it oxidizes in the air.

==Common changes==
===Traditional method===
Traditionally, a [[Cookbook:Mortar and Pestle|mortar and pestle]] was used to make the sauce, but this has generally been replaced by the food processor. Note, however, that the crushing action of the mortar and pestle produces a more intense flavour than the chopping action of a food processor. You can simulate the additional flavor of the mortar and pestle by placing the basil leaves in a plastic bag and crushing them with a rubber mallet or rolling pin prior to placing in the food processor. Indeed, the word &quot;pesto&quot; derives from the Italian for &quot;pestle&quot;, ''pestello''. 

Additionally, the cheese was added at the time of use, as it is the most likely to spoil.  Pesto without the cheese can be stored at room temperature for up to a month, or refrigerated for several.

===Different nuts===
A common change in the recipe is to replace some or all of the pine nuts with [[Cookbook:Sunflower Seed|sunflower seeds]], [[Cookbook:Walnut|walnut]]s, [[Cookbook:Pistachio|pistachios]] or [[Cookbook:Almond|almond]]s.  This significantly reduces the cost of the sauce.  Besides being cheaper, it is also necessary for people with nut allergies.

===Creamy pesto===
Take two tablespoons of the sauce above in a sauce pot and heat on medium-low.  Add one cup light [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]], and bring to a simmer.  Use for pasta.  Serves two.

===Sun-dried tomatoes===
Replace the pine nuts with an equal quantity of sun-dried [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]. Use as above.

===Different bases===
You may change the taste by changing the base of the pesto from basil to other easily obtained herbs/vegetables. For example, many variations include using [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]] (for a more aromatic taste) or [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]] (more &quot;bang for your buck&quot;, as spinach is much cheaper than basil, yet still has its own distinct flavor). Try to mix up the standard basil/garlic combo by introducing shallots (sweet onions) into the mix, as it adds a slightly sweet taste to the paste. A good alternate favorite pesto is to mix (fresh) chives, marjoram and thyme with the basil, which produces something akin to Valdostano-style pesto. Another nice variant replaces the basil with equal parts of leaf parsley and spring onions. [[Cookbook:Arugula|Arugula]] may also be substituted for basil with surprising, spicy results.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:California cuisine|California cuisine]] | [[Cookbook:Salad Recipes|Salad]]

The '''Caesar salad''' is a traditional salad served in American restaurants, often prepared tableside. It is referred to by some as the &quot;king&quot; of salads. 

Its origin is largely credited to Italian immigrant Caesar Cardini, a restaurateur and chef in Tijuana, Baja California del Norte, Mexico.  Cardini reportedly tossed the first such salad tableside at his restaurant on July 4, 1924.

===Ingredients:===
* 1 small head of [[Cookbook:Lettuce|Romaine lettuce]], torn into small bits 
* [[Cookbook:Garlic croutons|Garlic croutons]]
* 3 large cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|Garlic]] 
* 1 tablespoon of [[Cookbook:Worcestershire Sauce|Worcestershire sauce]] 
* 1 tablespoon of [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|Lemon juice]] 
* 1/4 cup [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|Olive oil]] 
* 1/4 cup [[Cookbook:Parmesan cheese|Parmesan cheese]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Egg|Egg]] yolk
* 2 fillets of anchovies

===Procedure===
Combine all ingredients, except for lettuce and croutons, in a [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]]. Blend to an even consistency. Combine lettuce and croutons in a large clean salad bowl. Add [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]] bits if desired. Add dressing and mix well. Add [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste.

==Caesar's Salad==

Serves 8

===Ingredients=== 

====Dressing====

* 2 dashes of Worcestershire sauce   

* large pinches of salt and fresh ground pepper
* 2/3 cup of olive oil 
* 2 tablespoons of wine vinegar
* Juice of 3 lemons 
* 2 raw eggs
* 2 fillets of Anchovies

====Salad and garnish====

* 2 large heads of Romaine lettuce (chilled, dry, crisp) 
* 2 cup of garlic croutons
* 3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

===Procedure===

====Dressing====
Start with boiling eggs for one minute to coddle. Open eggs and add to mixing bowl. Whisk alone until uniform and bubbly (optional to add hot water to slightly cook more).
Whisk in Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, lemon juice.
Slowly pour in olive oil and whisk thoroughly until emulsified. 
Season with salt and pepper to taste.

====Service====
(make 4 servings; hold four in reserve)
In another mixing bowl holding one of the two heads of lettuce, pour in enough dressing to coat all leaves and mix gently.  Reserve rest of dressing for second head of lettuce.
Plate the dressing-coated lettuce. Add half the croutons and grated parmesan.

'''Rosa Cardini describes her father's original recipe'''

[[w:Julia Child|Julia Child]], &quot;From Julia's Kitchen.&quot; Julia Child asked [[w:Caesar Cardini|Caesar Cardini]]'s daughter, Rosa, for the recipe.

On our television show I didn't have time to do the croutons Caesar's way, and you may want to follow Rosa's directions for them: cut homemade type unsweetened white bread into half-inch dice and dry out in the oven, basting them as they brown with olive oil in which you have steeped fresh crushed garlic for several days. Except for the croutons, the following recipe duplicates Rosa Cardini's instructions for her father's salad, as she repeated them to me.

* 2 large crisp heads romaine lettuce
* 2 large cloves garlic and a garlic press 
* Salt
* 3 cups best-quality olive oil
* 2 cups best-quality plain unseasoned toasted croutons
* 1 lemon
* 2 eggs
* 1/2 cup (1 ounce) genuine imported real Parmesan cheese, freshly grated
* Peppercorns in a grinder
* Worcestershire sauce

The romaine. You want 6 to 8 whole unblemished leaves of romaine, between 
3 and 7 inches long, per person. Strip the leaves carefully from the stalks, refrigerate rejects in a plastic bag and reserve for another salad.
Wash your Caesar leaves gently, to keep them from breaking, shake dry, roll loosely in clean towels. Refrigerate until serving time.

The croutons. Purée the garlic into a small heavy bowl, and mash to a
paste with a pestle or spoon, adding 1/4 teaspoon salt and dribbling in 3 tablespoons of the oil. Strain into a medium-sized frying pan and heat
to just warm, add the croutons, toss for about a minute over moderate heat
and turn into a nice serving bowl.

Other preliminaries. Shortly before serving, squeeze the lemon into a pitcher, boil the eggs exactly 1 minute, grate the cheese into another nice little bowl, and arrange all of these on a tray along with the rest of the olive oil, the croutons, pepper grinder, salt, and Worcestershire. Have large dinner plates chilled, arrange the romaine in the largest salad bowl you can find, and you are ready to go.

Mixing the salad. Prepare to use large rather slow and dramatic gestures for everything you do, as though you were Caesar himself. First pour 4 tablespoons of oil over the romaine and give the leaves 2 rolling tosses — hold salad fork in one hand, spoon in the other, and scoop under the leaves at each side of the bowl, bringing the implements around the edge to meet each other opposite you, then scoop them up toward you in a slow roll, bringing the salad leaves over upon themselves like a large wave breaking toward you; this is to prevent them from bruising as you season them. Sprinkle on 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 8 grinds of pepper, 2 more spoonfuls of oil, and give another toss. Pour on the lemon juice, 6 drops of Worcestershire, and break in the eggs. Toss twice, sprinkle on the cheese. Toss once, then sprinkle on the croutons and give 2 final tosses.

Serving. Arrange the salad rapidly but stylishly leaf by leaf on each large plate, stems facing outward, and a sprinkling of croutons at the side. Guests may eat the salad with their fingers, in the approved and original Caesar manner, or may use knives and forks — which they will need anyway for the croutons.

Using your fingers, wet the two edges nearest the cream cheese, then fold the other half down and seal the edges, making a triangle shape. Seal the edges tightly, but try to leave small gaps at the corners so the triangles will not expand so much that they burst.
#Drop several wontons into oil at a time. Turn over when the edges start to brown and cook for another minute or two. Set on paper towels to drain, then serve hot with sweet-and-sour sauce.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:California cuisine|California cuisine]] | [[Cookbook:Sandwiches|Sandwiches]]

The '''Au Jus Sandwich''', also known as '''French Dip Sandwiches''' or '''Roast Beef Au Jus''', trace their origin to a restaurant in downtown Los Angeles in 1918, when a local restaurant owner making a sandwich for a police officer accidentally dropped a French roll into a pan containing beef drippings.  The officer liked the sandwich so much that he brought some friends in the next day for some of these &quot;dipped sandwiches&quot;.  From that point on the au jus sandwich has gone on to become internationally known.  There are two restaurants in Los Angeles that claim to have originated the sandwich.  The more popularly known is Philippe The Original and the other is Cole's P.E. (Pacific Electric) Buffet - both have been in operation since 1908.

== Ingredients ==

* 2-3 [[Cookbook:Pound|pounds]] roast or other cut of [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]
* can [[Cookbook:Beef Consomme|beef consomme]] (~2 cups)
* can [[Cookbook:French Onion Soup|french onion soup]] (~2 cups)
* can of [[Cookbook:Beer|beer]]
* 4 [[Cookbook:Hoagie Roll|hoagie rolls]]
* cup of butter

== Procedure ==

# Combine all ingredients except the rolls in a [[Cookbook:Slow Cooker|crock pot]]. Let [[Cookbook:Simmer|simmer]] for at least six hours, or until tender and flaky. 
# Separate beef shreds from juices. Serve beef on split hoagie rolls or miniature French bread loaves, with a small bowl of juice on the side. 
# Dip sandwiches in juice as you eat. Bread can be toasted and buttered before adding beef, if you prefer.

== Notes, tips, and variations ==

*In the original sandwich, the bread was dipped in the juice prior to adding the meat, rather than dipped at the table.
*Other meats can be used the same way, including [[Cookbook:Lamb|lamb]], [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]], and [[Cookbook:Turkey|turkey]].
*Try adding [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]], [[Cookbook:Horseradish|horseradish]], or [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]] to the sandwich.

== Warnings ==

* Always read and follow the instructions that come with your crockpot.

[[Image:Empanadas.JPG|300px|right|thumb|Peruvian empanadas]]
In Spain, Latin America, and the Philippines, an [[wikipedia:empanada|empanada]] is essentially a stuffed pastry.

The filling usually consists primarily of [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]. It may also contain [[Cookbook:Ham|ham]] and [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]], ''humita'' corn with [[Cookbook:Béchamel Sauce|Béchamel sauce]], or [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]]. Fruit is used to create a [[Cookbook:Dessert|dessert]] empanada. Dessert empandas are usually baked, but may be fried. In some [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Argentina|Argentinean]] provinces, empanadas can be spiced with peppers, more akin to those of the rest of South America.

[[Cookbook:Cuisine of Chile|Chilean]] empanadas also use a wheat flour-based dough, but the meat filling is slightly different and often contains more onion. Chileans consider the Argentine filling ''seco'', or dry. Fried empanadas of shrimp/prawns and cheese are a favourite dish of the coastal areas, like Viña del Mar.

In [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Colombia|Colombia]], common empanadas are filled with chopped meat, pieces of potato, and yellow rice, and are eaten with a spicy sauce made of cilantro and ají pepper, stuffed in a corn-based pastry and fried.

It is likely that empanadas are originally from Galicia, [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Spain|Spain]], where they were prepared rather like [[Cookbook:Cornish Pastie|Cornish pasties]] as a portable and hearty meal for working people and often filled with leftovers or staple ingredients. Tuna and chicken are varieties still seen in Galicia.

==Wheat Dough Recipe==

===Ingredients===
*1 [[Cookbook:kg|kg]] [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]s
*200 [[Cookbook:g|g]] [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] (or [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]])
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp.]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*2-3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] cold water
*[[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*[[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]]

===Procedure===
#Dissolve salt in water.  
#Mix eggs, flour, butter and 1 cup of water to form a dough.  While kneading the dough, gradually add in more water until the dough is soft and stretchy.  If the dough becomes sticky, add more flour.  
#Once the dough is the desired consistency, allow to rest for a couple minutes, then roll it out to a thickness of ~2-3 [[Cookbook:mm|mm]] (1/10 inch).  
#Cut the dough into discs roughly 10-15 [[Cookbook:cm|cm]] (4 to 6 inches) in diameter.

For a flakier crust, before cutting it into discs, lightly coat the dough with olive oil and dust with cornstarch.  Fold the dough in half (with the cornstarch on the inside) and again coat with oil and cornstarch. Fold again and roll out to a thickness of ~2-3 mm (1/10 inch).

==Filling (''Relleno'')==

Every household in Argentina has its own special recipe for empanada filling.  The fillings vary from region to region, with some being sweet and others spicy.  The following is a recipe for a sweet empanada filling typical of those found in the province of Santa Fe.

===Ingredients===
*1 [[Cookbook:kg|kg]] ground [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]
*1 large [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tblsp]] [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]]
*2 tblsp [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1 1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Black pepper|black pepper]]
*1 1/2 tsp [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]]
*1 tsp [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1/2 tsp ground [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]] (''comino''), optional. Cumin is very invasive and gives the filling a whole different flavor.
*1/2 tsp ground [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*1/4 tsp [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]]
*1/4 tsp [[Cookbook:Clove|clove]]s
*1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]]
*[[Cookbook:Green Olives|green olives]] (optional)
*[[Cookbook:Dice|dice]]d hardboiled [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] (optional)
*diced boiled [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]]es (optional)

===Procedure===
#Dice onion into small pieces and [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sauté]] in vegetable oil in a large [[Cookbook:Frying pan|frying pan]]. Add and [[Cookbook:Brown|brown]] ground beef.  
#While beef is browning, mix in salt, sugar and spices. 
#Once meat has finished cooking, remove from heat and add raisins.  
#If desired add sliced olives, egg or potatoes.

==Filling (''Pino'')==

&quot;Pino&quot; is the name of the filling used in Chilean empanadas. Much like filling for Argentine empanadas, each Chilean househould has their own pino. The one below is like the Argentine but includes more onions and does not have the cinnamon, nutmeg, or cloves, and uses less sugar.

===Ingredients===
*1 [[Cookbook:kg|kg]] ground [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]
*2 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
*3 large [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tblsp]] [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*1 tblsp [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1 1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Black Pepper|black pepper]]
*1 1/2 tsp [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]]
*1 tsp [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1/2 tsp ground [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]] (''comino'')
*1 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaf]]
*1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]]
*[[Cookbook:Black Olive|black olives]]
*[[Cookbook:Dice|dice]]d hardboiled [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]

===Procedure===
#Dice onion into small pieces and [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sauté]] in olive oil in a large [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]]. Mince garlic and add to the onions. Add and [[Cookbook:Brown|brown]] ground beef.  
#While beef is browning, mix in salt, sugar, spices and bay leaf. 
#Allow to [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]] for about 20 mins for flavours to blend.
#Remove bay leaf, and add olives and raisins.

==Empanada preparation==

#Place 1-2 tablespoons of empanada filling into the center of one of the dough discs (''[[Cookbook:Tapas|tapas]]'').
#If Chilean empanadas are being made add one piece of the diced hardboiled egg next to the filling.
#Wet the outer edge of the tapa with cold water and fold the tapa in half to encase the filling, ensuring there is no air left inside (the wet portion will help the dough stick together, air will burst out when cooked).  
#Holding the empanada in the palm of one hand, with the round edge pointing outwards, pinch and twist over a small (finger-sized) portion of the dough at the top.  Continue pinching and twisting around the outer edge until you reach the bottom of the empanada, so that the open edge is sealed shut.  (you can also use a fork to smash together the lips of the outer edge, but it is not the traditional way and the filling can burst through).  
#Repeat for the remaining filling and dough.
#To cook the empanadas, [[Cookbook:Deep fry|deep fry]] in vegetable oil on medium heat until golden brown.  Alternatively, you can glaze them with butter and cook on a cookie sheet in the oven at [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|400 °F]] for 8-10 minutes or until light brown. 
#Allow empanadas to cool and then eat.     

Empanadas are usually eaten with your hands (like a [[Cookbook:Taco|taco]] or [[Cookbook:Burrito|burrito]]).

*'''Meats:''' [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] breasts or quartered chicken legs or chicken thighs -- broiler/fryer type, cut into bite-size pieces, if you want to skewer it, or sliced into some manageable shape. (either chicken or [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] is traditional)

==Procedure==
Mix quantities of liquids, spices, and vegetables into a salsa-like paste. The exact taste and texture will depend on which you mix to make the paste, but it traditionally always is somewhat hot, and with a spicy 'bite' to it. Traditionally, allspice, preferably from Jamaica, is always one of the spices.  This paste sometimes is chilled separately from the meat, but not always.

Take the spices and associate their flavours with the meat. Various methods include: pounding the paste into the meat, massaging it into the meat, marinating the meat, stuffing it into poked (jerked) holes in the meat, putting it into a sealed bag with the meat, basting it on the meat, coating it on the meat, rubbing it on the meat, etc.

The spices are generally applied anywhere from half a day to three days, depending on the cook.

Historically, the 'jerk' method comes from the Carib-Arawak Indians who lived in Jamaica. 
They would hunt an animal, kill and prepare it. They would NOT remove the skin. They would then poke holes (jerk with a sharp stick) into the skin, and put spices in the holes. Finally they would put it in a deep pit, like a barbecue, which was lined with charcoal and stones and covered with green wood (traditionally from the pimento tree).  Burning the wood generated lots of smoke which flavored the food. The holes also let out the heat while keeping the meat moist. Sometimes the food would be cooked with a metal container of water to increase the moistness.

==Tips, tricks and variations==
The spices always included allspice because the berries of the pimento tree are the source of allspice.
When cooking the meat, barbeque is by far the best technique, failing that oven bake. Basting with beer is worth trying. Serve with rice n pea.

==Warnings==
See the [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili pepper]] warnings.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cheese|Cheese]] | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|Cuisine of the United States]] | [[Cookbook:Sandwiches|Sandwiches]]

A '''Toasted Cheese Sandwich''' works well as an everyday lunch. It goes well with soda (pop) or [[Cookbook:Tomato Soup|tomato soup]]. Quality greatly depends on ingredient selection and cooking temperature. A good '''Toasted Cheese Sandwich''' has a crispy outside, and is not mushy.

==Ingredients==

* [[Cookbook:Cheddar Cheese|Mild Cheddar Cheese]], chosen to be low in moisture. When buying cheese, most likely you will find that the cheeses are labeled for fat, protein, and total weight. Consider the unmentioned part to be moisture, and choose the cheese which minimizes this. For any given amount of protein per weight, choose the cheese with the highest fat content. Likewise, for any given amount of fat per weight, choose the cheese with the highest protein content.
* [[Cookbook:Bread|Sturdy low-moisture bread]]. Multi-grain bread tends to work well. Sourdough and English toasting bread should also work OK. Arnold's Health Nut Bread works very well. Whole wheat and plain white bread are not recommended.

==Procedure==
#Slice the cheese 1/8-inch thick.
#Cover a piece of bread with cheese. If you leave gaps, distribute them evenly throughout the middle.
#Put on another slice of bread.
#Place the sandwich into a cool 2-sided contact-based cooking device. A waffle iron might work. The George Foreman grill, intended for cooking burgers, works very well and so does a sandwich-iron.
#Heat the sandwich.
#Remove the sandwich when all the cheese has melted and the outside is medium-dark brown and crispy.
#Eat immediately. If you must set this sandwich down, use a heated plate or a loose paper towel to avoid letting condensation ruin the surface.
#Remember to cool the cooking device a bit before cooking another sandwich.

==Variation==
Add relatively dry [[Cookbook:Tuna|tuna]], [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]], or [[Cookbook:Pastrami|pastrami]]. After cooking, you may pry open the sandwich to add [[Cookbook:Sauerkraut|sauerkraut]], [[Cookbook:Pickle|pickles]], or sweet chilli sauce.

A bit of Worcestershire Sauce poured on the cheese before cooking also works well.

{{recipe}}

'''Goulash''' ('''Gulyás''' in [[w:Hungarian language|Hungarian]], from ''gulya'', &quot;herd of cattle&quot;) is a food which originated in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Hungary|Hungary]].  In some regions of the [[w:United States|United States]], the term &quot;goulash&quot; is used interchangeably with &quot;[[en:hot dish|hot dish]]&quot; and &quot;[[en:casserole|casserole]]&quot;.

Goulash is made of [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]], [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]s and [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]]. 

According to some people, nowadays it is hard to find a genuine gulyás in Hungary or outside Hungary. Original Hungarian goulash could be anything containing beef and various vegetables, sour cream or any kind of pasta; naturally these show no real similarities to Hungarian gulyás.

The food is closely related to ''Pörkölt'' (&quot;[[Cookbook:Stew|stew]]&quot;) which is a similar, very widespread food in Hungary, but gulyás is much easier to cook and requires less attention, thus it fits occasions when there are many hungry people and a busy cook.

There is no official goulash recipe, but here is one very simple one, being pretty close to the idealised version:

==Ingredients==
*[[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]
*[[Cookbook:Onion|onions]]
*[[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]
*[[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
*[[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]]
*[[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]

==Procedure==
#Take some beef (leg or stringy meat) and cut it into small cubes. Chop the onions. 
#Put a layer of meat on the bottom of a pot or a ''bogrács'' (big pot over an open fire), then a layer of onions, and put paprika, garlic and salt on them. Add another meat layer; continue until you have used all the ingredients.  Add a 16 oz can of tomatoes. 
#Cover with a lid, put on a small fire or low heat, and let it cook. The meat will cook in its own liquids, so add water only if there is not enough while cooking. It requires almost no stirring. 
#When the meat is cooked, put in large pieces of potatoes, add water to cover it if needed, and cook for further 15 minutes.

==Notes, tips and variations==
Its color could be even nicer if you reserve half of the paprika and add it in the last 10 minutes.

If you're not afraid of [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]]s then the &quot;pour some paprika and salt&quot; could be read as &quot;melt some pork fat and put the salt and paprika in it while stirring, then pour this onto the layer of onions&quot;. It doesn't really work with oil.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Mexico|Mexican]] | [[Cookbook:Tex-Mex cuisine|Tex-Mex cuisine]] | [[Cookbook:Appetizers|Appetizers]] | [[Cookbook:Sauce|Sauce]]

[[Image:Guacamole.JPG.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Guacamole is a Mexican dish made from crushed avocado]]

'''Guacamole''' is a spicy [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Mexico|Mexican]] (or [[Cookbook:Tex-Mex cuisine|Tex-Mex]]) paste made from crushed avocado and various [[Cookbook:Herbs and Spices|seasonings]], usually including [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|peppers]], [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] and [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]].  Guacamole is used as a condiment, an ingredient, and as an [[Cookbook:Appetizers|appetizer]] when served with [[Cookbook:Tortilla Chip|tortilla chips]].

==Recipe I==
===Ingredients===
*3 [[Cookbook:Avocado|avocado]]s
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Pico de Gallo|pico de gallo]]
*[[Cookbook:Juice|juice]] of 1/2 [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]]
*1 chopped [[Cookbook:Jalapeño|Jalapeño]] OR 2 tablespoons crushed [[Cookbook:Red pepper|red pepper]] OR 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Cayenne Pepper|cayenne pepper]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*4 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*1 1/2 teaspoon chopped [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
*1/2 teaspoon ground [[Cookbook:Black Pepper|black pepper]]
*1 minced jalapeño OR 2 minced [[Cookbook:Chile Pepper|serrano chiles]] OR 2 tablespoon minced any chile pepper like (adjust for spiciness)

===Procedure===
Pit the avocados. Score avocado  without cutting through the skin. Scoop out one avocado with a large spoon and place in mixing bowl. Add the lime juice and stir to evenly coat the avocados. Stir in the Pico de Gallo, garlic, oil, jalapeño, salt,  red pepper, and black pepper, mashing and tossing the avocado pieces until thoroughly mixed. Then scoop out the other avocados and gently mix and toss in the larger pieces. The guacamole is the right consistency when more large pieces than mashed parts remain. Garnish with a sprig of cilantro.

==Recipe II==
''The ingredients and quantities of this recipe are tuned to the tastes of one contributor; you should experiment with it. (Especially note that it has got rather a lot of lime, and you might want to add peppers, chilis or tabasco.)''

===Ingredients===
*2 very ripe [[Cookbook:Avocado|avocados]]
*1 clove [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], crushed
*[[Cookbook:Juice|juice]] of 1 1/2 [[Cookbook:Lime|limes]]
*1 small [[Cookbook:Onion|Red onion]], [[Cookbook:Dice|diced]] very small
*1 small [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]], diced very small
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbsp]] chopped [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]] (coriander leaves)
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste

===Procedure===
Put everything except the avocados into a medium-sized mixing bowl. Halve the avocados and scoop the flesh into the bowl. Using a large fork (or a [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]]), mash the avocados and combine with all the other ingredients. Taste the mixture and add anything you think necessary (be aware that the flavors, especially the lime, will soften a little by the time it is served). Cover and refrigerate for at least an hour to allow the flavors to blend. When it is removed from the refrigerator, there may be some brown on the top - scrape it off.

==Recipe III==

This alternative recipe is somewhat simpler, but gives an extremely tasty Guacamole which is great with [[Cookbook:Tortilla Chip|tortilla chips]] or [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]], or can be used in [[Cookbook:Enchilada|enchiladas]], etc. It also avoids messing about with messy [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], or coriander, which some people do not like the taste of. I have tried many guacamole recipes over the years, this is both the simplest, and in my opinion, the tastiest I know.

===Ingredients===
*3 whole [[Cookbook:Avocado|avocados]], ripe but not over-ripe
*1 [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]]
*3 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
*2 or 3 whole red [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili peppers]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

===Procedure===
Prepare avocados by halving and removing the stone (the simplest way to do this is to hold the avocado in the palm of your hand and strike the stone squarely and firmly with a chef's knife - the knife will then pull the stone out easily. If it doesn't come out easily, the avocado isn't ripe enough). Keep one half avocado back, skin and blend the rest using a hand-held food processor, add the juice of the lime, finely chop chilies and garlic, add and blend a bit longer. Add generous salt to taste. Finally roughly chop avocado half kept back and add to paste to give chunky texture. Resulting dip will keep for several days in a fridge, shouldn't brown too much if covered (the lime juice will act as an antioxidant as well as giving a nice flavour), but in general will be found to disappear very rapidly by enthusiastic consumers!

==Recipe IV (quick)==
This recipe is great if you have the ripe avocadoes because you can make it in about five minutes.

===Ingredients===
* 3-4 ripe avocados
* juice of 1/2 lime
* mild storebought salsa

===Procedure===
# Peel, seed, and mash the avocados.
# Add the juice of 1/2 lime.
# Stir in store bought (but fresh) mild or medium salsa to taste.
# Serve immediately.

===Variant===
# For fancier version, make your own [[Cookbook:Pico de Gallo|Pico de Gallo]] and use instead of store-bought salsa

==Recipe V (simple)==
This is a rather simple recipe, needing only avocado, lime, dried chili and salt.

===Ingredients===
*1 ripe [[Cookbook:Avocado|avocado]]
*1/2 a [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]]
*[[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|red pepper]] flakes - to taste 
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] - to taste
Note: fresh hot peppers also work well, instead of the red pepper flakes, if available - if used, slice them finely.

===Procedure===
Peel the avocado and pit it, then slice the avocado into small chunks, around a [[Cookbook:cm|centimeter]] or half-[[Cookbook:Inch|inch]] per side.  Juice half the lime.  Add the lime, some salt, and a moderate amount of red pepper to the avocado chunks.  Err on the side of adding too little spice; it's easy to add more, but too much makes the guacamole really scorch.  Mash the ingredients together.

==Recipe VI (simplest)==
This recipe is the simplest of the group. It is very simple and more attuned to use as an aditive. This recipe is a more traditional Mexican guacamole and does not include many of the features comonly associated with the dish be Americans used to the Tex-Mex Version.

===Ingredients===
*2 ripe [[Cookbook:Avocado|avocados]]
*juice of 1/2 lime
*2 tablespoons (app.) chopped [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]]
*salt to taste

===Procedure===
Pit avocado by, carefully, lodging base end of chef's knife in pit, twisting to remove, and then pinching the pit off of the knife. Remove flesh with large spoon, being careful to maintain the integrity of the flesh. Dice in large chunks and transfer to mixing bowl. Mash to desired consistency. Add lime, stire to combine. Add other ingredients, stir to combine.

==Recipe VII==
Similar to the first and second recipes, this variant acts very well on its own as a side dish or appetizer, also very good in [[Cookbook:Fajita|fajitas]]. This recipe can easily be multiplied beyond the two avocado serving.

===Ingredients===
*2 ripe [[Cookbook:Avocado|avacado]]
*juice of 1 lime, thoroughly juiced
*2-3 tablespoons chopped [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]] 
*1/4 cup (app.) of [[Cookbook:Tomato|cherry, grape, or pear tomatoes]] halved or quartered, with 1/8 cup (app.) seeded
*juice of 1 [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]], thoroughly juiced
*4 tablespoons (app.) chopped [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]]
*1/2 red onion, diced
*2 jalepeño peppers, 1 seeded and 1 not, diced finely
*Kosher salt and extra virgin olive oil to taste

===Procedure===
Pit avocado by, carefully, lodging base end of chef's knife in pit, twisting to remove, and then pinching the pit off of the knife. Remove flesh with large spoon, being careful to maintain the integrity of the flesh. Dice in large chunks and transfer to mixing bowl. Mash to desired consistency. Add lime, stir to combine. Add other ingredients, stir to combine.

===Recommended Uses===
Works well on [[Cookbook:Bean|beans]], in [[Cookbook:Taco|tacos]] and other Mexican food, or even as a topping for [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]].  It also can add flavor and moisture to overly dry food. However, perhaps the best use is as a dip for tortilla chips.

===Variant===
Avocado salad can be made by not mashing the avocado chunks.  Optionally, add a grated [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]].  This makes a good side dish or small meal.

----

'''Tip''': An old [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Mexico|Mexican]] trick to avoid or reduce the brown oxidized layer on the top is to put the whole avocado pit back into the guacamole once it's prepared. ''Never'' cut the pit in pieces; that will make the guacamole bitter. This trick doesn't really work though. The only way to prevent the oxidation is to eliminate the exposure to air. Covering the surface with plastic wrap so no air is in contact with the sauce works well. Be sure to include some lime in your recipe, this will prevent such oxidation. 

----
'''Tip 2''': 

One of the most vexing problems with guacamole is that it spoils so rapidly. Traditional strategies, such as the use of a well-placed avocado pit or the use of prodigious amounts the lime and/or lemon juice, are used to prevent premature browning of guacamole. A young chef from El Paso, Texas, has developed a much more effective approach to keep guacamole fresh for up to three times longer than traditional methods. Through trial and error, Alfred M. Gladstein found that the use of a various vegetable oils blended in to the concoction would keep it fresh longer and significantly increase the amount of time before the guacamole browns and spoils. In his studies Gladstein found that mixing olive oil in guacamole worked best when serving the dish independently or with warm foods, while vegetable oil (corn or canola) worked best when the guacamole is served with cold foods and salads. When these techniques are employed, Gladstein, who is also known as Chef Jamir, found that the refrigerated guacamole would stay fresh and green for three days or more. He also notes that when serving the guacamole at room temperature, the oil-treated dish will last up to six to eight hours before starting to brown.

'''Preserved Lemons''' are a common flavoring agent in Moroccan cuisine, particularly in very slow braises known as [[Cookbook:Tagines|tagines]].  They are also found as an unusual cocktail garnish.

== Ingredients ==
*[[Cookbook:Lemon|Lemons]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]]

== Procedure ==
Poke holes in the lemons with a sharp knife.  Pack them in an airtight jar, separating them from one another with salt.  Cover the jar, store in a dark place for a day.  If the lemons have not released enough liquid to cover, add salt and reseal.

Store in a cool dark place for approximately two weeks.  Refrigerate afterwards.

==Border Style Quesadilla Recipe==

This is a good appetizer and goes well with sourcream.
Preheat a frying pan or griddle, seasoned with oil. Drop in a [[Cookbook:Tortilla|tortilla]]. You can use either a flour or corn tortilla, but most people prefer flour.

Alternatively, preheat pan and drop in tortilla, lightly buttered on the down side.

Drop on it shredded cheese (typically [[Cookbook:Monterey Jack Cheese|Monterey Jack cheese]]), and any of the following:
* [[Cookbook:Salsa|salsa]]
* [[Cookbook:Sarza Criolla|sarza criolla]]
* [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili pepper]]s
* Chopped [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]] and [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]]
* Cooked [[Cookbook:Meat and Poultry|meat or seafood]]
* [[Cookbook:Avocado|avocado]] or [[Cookbook:Guacamole|guacamole]]
* Fresh spinach--washed and torn into small pieces
* Black beans--canned, rinsed and well drained

Cover with another tortilla (or fold the one tortilla in half), cook until the cheese binds the two tortillas together and the outside barely starts to brown, flip it over, fry a little longer.

Slice into strips and serve with any of those optional ingredients on top, or with a dipping sauce, or with sour cream. A mixture of sour cream and lime juice with chopped cilantro also makes an excellent sauce.

Usage Note: Quesadillas in Mexico may not contain cheese.  These are typically made with a meat mixture inside a tortilla that is fried, similar to a large fried wonton.

{{recipe}}

== Ingredients ==
* 300g (10 oz) large [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]] spirals (dry)
* 2 table spoons of extra virgin [[Cookbook:Olive oil|olive oil]], more if you like it
* 2 large [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] cloves, crushed and finely chopped, more if you like it
* 4 large ripe [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], well chopped, seeds and skin included. Remove the seeds and skin if you like, but it isn't mandatory.
* handful of well ripped [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]] leaves
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]], to taste
* 4 tablespoons of freshly, finely grated [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan]]-style [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]] ([[Cookbook:Parmigiano Reggiano|Parmigiano Reggiano]] recommended!)

== Preparation ==
# Cook dry pasta in plenty of salted boiling water for 10-12 minutes. By the way, the proper cooking time should be indicated on the pasta box itself. If it's not, you better taste one pasta piece from time to time, and stop the cooking when it's still crispy but not tough though(it should be ''al dente''). Prepare the sauce while the pasta is cooking:
# '''Sauce:''' Heat the olive oil gently in a large [[Cookbook:Frying pan|frypan]] or [[Cookbook:Wok|wok]]. When moderately hot add the garlic and gently [[Cookbook:Pan fry|fry]] until lightly coloured only. Avoid overcooking. Add the tomatoes and cook for several minutes, stirring and folding the ingredients. If there is a lot of liquid from the tomatoes, turn up the heat a little and reduce it a bit. Stir in the basil and turn the heat down.
# By this time the pasta should be cooked. Turn off the heat to the pasta and use a slotted spoon to transfer the pasta to the sauce in the other pan. Don't worry if a little of the cooking water is transferred - this is a good thing as long as you don't swamp the sauce with it(you could also use a colander to drain the pasta alternatively). Season to taste, stir and pour into a large pasta bowl for serving. Scatter the cheese over the whole dish, reserving some for the table.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Sandwiches|Sandwiches]] | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|US Cuisine]]

A '''grilled cheese sandwich''' is a simple dish consisting of two slices of bread with [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]] between them, [[Cookbook:Grilling|grilled]]. It is often served with [[Cookbook:Tomato Soup|tomato soup]].

==Ingredients==
*1-3 slices of cheese, typically [[Cookbook:Cheddar Cheese|cheddar]], [[Cookbook:Gouda Cheese|gouda]], [[Cookbook:Limberger Cheese|Limberger]] or [[Cookbook:American Cheese|American]], though any smoothly melting cheese will do.
*2 slices of [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]
*[[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]] (not recommended, as direct heating tends to negatively affect the taste of margarine)

Makes 1 sandwich.

==Procedure==

Simply heat up a [[Cookbook:Skillet|skillet]], [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]] or [[Cookbook:Griddle|griddle]] (it is best on most stoves to heat on medium), spread the [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]] on the [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]], and place both pieces of bread, butter side down, in the skillet. When the butter sides of both have browned (check periodically), flip one over and place 1-3 slices (this depends on the size of the slices) of cheese on top, and place the other slice of bread on top of the cheese (again, butter side down). At this point, it is advised to compress the sandwich, for example by pressing on it with a spatula. Once the bottom side of the sandwich is browned sufficiently, flip the sandwich over. When both sides are browned, take off heat, cut, and serve.

The goal is to get a nicely browned [[Cookbook:Sandwiches|sandwich]] with melted cheese in the middle.

If you lack a stove, you can prepare a fast and easy version of this sandwich simply with a toaster. This method is good for younger or otherwise inexperienced cooks because it does not require a stove. Take two slices of bread and butter them on both sides (or spread margarine or a similar substitute). Place the double-buttered slices into the toaster and toast until the bread is browned. Remove the two hot, crispy slices of toast from the toaster and place a slice of cheese between them. The cheese melts quickly. Cut and serve immediately. If desired, place the entire sandwich back into one slot of the toaster to melt the cheese even further.

== Variations ==
One variation is to spread some [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]] on the inside of the sandwich.  Also, mayonnaise can be mixed in a cup with a little mustard to taste and spread on both slices of bread before adding the fillings.  Another variation is to put 1 or 2 slices of [[Cookbook:Ham|ham]] or seeded fresh [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]] inside the sandwich.  For a [[Cookbook:Pizza|pizza]]-like variant, spread [[Cookbook:Ketchup|ketchup]] on both pieces of bread, add cheese and some slices of [[Cookbook:Salami|salami]]. Another variation is to spread the bread with a mix of mayonnaise and BBQ sauce.  Fill with slices of cheddar cheese and some shredded pork rib meat.  Diced raw onion, a few sweet pickles or some crumbled bacon can also be added.  It is common practice at the Ma-Ka-Ja-Wan Scout Reservation in Pearson, WI to substitute a garlic-flavored spread for the butter.

'''Mincemeat''' is a spiced fruit preserve that does not in fact contain meat, although it may contain animal suet. The name is a throwback to Middle English from when &quot;meat&quot; was a word for all food, or to Victorian and earlier recipes that did combine minced lamb or beef with the spiced, preserved fruits.

Mincemeat Tarts are large (8 inch (20cm) diameter or more) open pastry tarts, sometimes with a lattice pastry top, and occasionally also containing baked or stewed apple. The smaller pastry topped tarts traditionally served at Christmas are known as Mince Pies.

==Ingredients for Mincemeat ==

*1 [[Cookbook:Pound|lb]] (500 [[Cookbook:gram|g]]) seeded [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]]
*1 lb (500 g) [[Cookbook:Currant|currants]]
*½ lb (250 g) finely ground beef [[Cookbook:Suet|suet]]. Suet is pure beef fat and can be obtained from the butcher at the market. (They will grind it on request.) Vegetarians can substitute a solid vegetable fat such as Pura Vegetable Suet.
*Rind of 2 [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemons]]
*½ lb (250 g) candied [[Cookbook:Orange|orange]] peel
*½ lb (250 g) candied [[Cookbook:Citron|citron]]
*12 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] (375 g) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*2 lbs (1 [[Cookbook:kg|kg]]) green [[Cookbook:Apple|apples]], peeled
*½ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] (3 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]]
*½ tsp (3 mL) [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*½ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (120 mL) [[Cookbook:Brandy|brandy]] or [[Cookbook:Rum|rum]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|Tbsp]] (15 mL) [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

==Procedure==

Wash currents and dry. Set aside. Put remaining ingredients--citron, orange peel, lemon rind, raisins, apples and suet--through a meat grinder using the course grinder blade. Add currents, brandy, spices and mix together.

Store in a tightly covered plastic container in the refrigerator (do not freeze.) for up to one year. Makes 4½ [[Cookbook:Pint|pints]] (2.25 [[Cookbook:Liter|liters]]).

Note: Candied orange peel and citron can be found in most markets around Thanksgiving.

==Pastry for Tarts==

Traditional British Mince Pies are made using a good [[Cookbook:Shortcrust Pastry|Shortcrust Pastry]], although Wheat Flour would be used in place of the given Potato flour in the recipe linked.
Pillsbury Pie Crusts, found in the dairy section of most grocery stores in the USA, work very well. 

Let the slices warm slightly to almost room temperature. Unwrap and place on a floured cutting board. For best results, roll the dough slightly thinner. Use a doughnut cutter with the center removed or a 2½ inch round cookie cutter to cut the tart shells Gently press into 1½ inch (4 cm) tart pans. Fill with mincemeat and top with a 1 inch (2.5 cm) round piece of pastry cut with the doughnut hole cutter. For added decoration, cut or press a design into the 1 inch pastry round before placing in the center of the filled tart. For a glazed top, lightly brush the pastry lids with milk, or a mixture of milk and beaten egg.

Bake at [[Cookbook:Oven temperatures|425 °F (220 °C)]] for approx. 20 mins or until pastry is lightly browned at the edges. Allow to cool on a wire rack, and dust with icing sugar. People wanting a more alcoholic kick to their Mince Pie may also want to inject them with a little extra Brandy.

This is the traditional Lippischer '''[[w:Pickert|Pickert]]''', a type of [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]] dish somewhere between a [[Cookbook:Dumpling|dumpling]] and a [[Cookbook:Pancake|pancake]].

==Ingredients==

*1 [[Cookbook:kg|kg]] (5 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]]s) [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1 [[Cookbook:L|litre]] (4 cups) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*10 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]s
*6 big [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], grated
*1 cube [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]] (about 16 g or 0.6 oz dried yeast)
*500 [[Cookbook:g|g]] (2 cups) [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisin]]s
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*[[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] for frying

==Yield==

10-15 pickerts - enough for four to five people.

==Procedure==

#Put the yeast in a very big pot. Mix it with handwarm milk and with the grated potatoes. Put all the flour into the pot and the eggs too. Finally add salt and sugar. Now stir it until it is a homogenous mass. It should be neither runny nor solid, but have a consistency like soft cookie dough; add milk or flour to adjust. Let sit for 30 minutes.
#Put palm-sized amounts into a frying pan and fry them on low heat with lots of oil. 
#Serve it with [[Cookbook:Liver|liver]] [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausage]] (Leberwurst), syrup, [[Cookbook:Plum|plum]] [[Cookbook:Jam|jam]] or a small chunk of butter. After a few Pickerts you will get desire for another special pleasure from [[w:Lippe|Lippe]]: a glass of [[w:Wacholder|Wacholder]] schnapps.

==Variants==
To make a ''pfannenpickert'', add half a handful of raisins to the dough and fry a larger amount of dough (approx. 15 centimeters across). A single pfannenpickert is often enough for one person.

*1/4 cup [[Cookbook:Butter|Butter]], melted
*1 Tbsp. cold [[Cookbook:Water|Water]]
*2-3 tsp. [[Cookbook:Lemon|Lemon]] juice
*[[Cookbook:Cayenne pepper|Cayenne pepper]]
*crusty [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]

==Procedure==

===Eggs===

#Separate eggs. Mix whites with milk and parsley, then add salt and pepper. Beat with a fork until slightly bubbly. Set aside.
#Cook bacon on medium-high heat in a large, nonstick [[Cookbook:Skillet|skillet]] and set on paper towels or napkins to drain. Pour off all but 1-2 tablespoons fat. Turn heat down to medium-low and add egg whites.

===Hollandaise sauce===

#As egg whites cook, mix egg yolks with water in [[Cookbook:Double boiler|double boiler]] on medium to medium-high heat. Water should simmer, not boil. Stir constantly with a fork until yolks increase in size and thickness and turn a pale, opaque yellow. Remove from heat and slowly stir in melted butter. Then add lemon juice and salt and cayenne pepper to taste.
#Place cooked egg whites on a plate, top with bacon, then cover with Hollandaise sauce. Serve with warm crusty bread for dipping in the sauce.

Serves 1 for a full meal or 2 for a light breakfast.

Notes: 
The amount of butter in this recipe is less than in standard recipes for Hollandaise sauce. This is the smallest amount that still produces an acceptable sauce. If fat is not a concern, however, increase the amount to 1/3 or 1/2 cup.

Egg whites usually cook in the same amount of time as the sauce, but keep an eye on them and remove them to a separate plate if they finish cooking before the sauce is done.

The Sunglow Motel-Cafe in [[w:Bicknell, Utah|Bicknell, Utah]] serves the unique '''Pickle Pie''', developed by Cula Ekker.

This is their recipe, as it appeared in a ''[[w:Salt Lake Tribune|Salt Lake Tribune]]'' article that is framed and hangs on the cafe's wall.

==Ingredients==
*5 [[Cookbook:Eggs|eggs]]
*2 cups [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]]
*1 tsp. lemon extract
*2 tbsp. cornstarch
*1 cup + 2 tbsp. light cream
*1/8 cup [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]], melted
*12 oz. sweet pickles, drained and ground
*2 unbaked 9-inch pie shells

==Method==
Beat eggs and sugar until lemon colored and thick; beat in cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon extract, cornstarch, cream and margarine. Stir ground sweet pickles into mixture.

Pour pickle mixture into unbaked pie shell. Bake at 350 degrees for one hour to one hour and 15 minutes, until a knife inserted in center comes out clean.

Makes two pies.

==Notes==
''Note: Although the recipe says to bake for one hour to one hour and 15 minutes, I'd suggest checking it earlier (perhaps at 45 minutes) just to be safe, because when I tested it at one hour the pies I made were already clearly past done.'' -- [[w:User:RTC|RTC]] 15:22 Nov 14, 2002 (UTC)

''Note: I found by accident that increasing the pickles from 12 oz. to about 17 oz. introduces a distinct &quot;fruity&quot; flavor that the original recipe does not have. Both versions are very good, in my opinion!'' -- [[w:User:RTC|RTC]] 19:04 Nov 17, 2002 (UTC)

A traditional '''Pound Cake''' recipe would specify one pound each of the following ingredients.  These quantities are too great for most modern families, but an excellent cake can be made with half quantities.  It is usual to weigh the eggs first and then use the same weights of the other ingredients; with a traditional pair of kitchen scales, the eggs are simply used instead of weights.

==Ingredients==

*&amp;frac12; pound [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] 
*&amp;frac12; pound [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] 
*&amp;frac12; pound [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]] (4 eggs)
*&amp;frac12; pound [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] 
*&amp;frac12; pound assorted dried fruit ([[Cookbook:Currant|currants]], [[Cookbook:Sultana|sultanas]], and [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]], with perhaps a lesser quantity of [[Cookbook:Glacé cherry|glacé]] [maraschino] cherries).

==Procedure==

#Cream the butter and sugar together until fluffy. 
#Beat in the eggs. 
#Gradually sift in the dry ingredients. 
#Transfer to a greased and floured baking pan. 
#Bake at 175 °C (350 °F), until a skewer inserted shows no moist crumbs when removed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipesummary|Turkey recipes|6-12|1-2 days' prep time, 3 hours to cook|4}}

{{recipe}}

This recipe is for a 16-18 pound turkey. Roughly 2 days are required to prepare the bird. The first day is for preparations and for brining, and the second day is for cooking the turkey.

==Ingredients==
* 8.5-14 pound [[Cookbook:Turkey|Turkey]]
* 2 Tbs. (1/2 stick) unsalted butter to coat skin of turkey
* 1/2 gallon of water
** 2 cups kosher salt
** 1/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar
** 2 Tbs. peppercorns 
* 2 gallons of ice water (50% ice)

==Brining==
#In 1/2 gallon of water, combine the salt and brown sugar for the brine and bring to a boil for about 3 minutes.  Remove from heat and add to 5 gallon bucket.
#Add the remaining ice water.
#Remove neck and giblets from turkey and put in 5 gallon bucket. If brine won't cover turkey add a little more water. 
#Put bucket in a cold area for 6 to 24 hours.

==Roasting directions==
The tricky thing about cooking poultry is that the dark meat needs to be about 15 degrees hotter than the white meat. White meat is safe to eat at 165°F, which is the temperature at which salmonella instantly dies. (Though 12 minutes at 140°F will kill it as well, so odds are fairly good that, for a roast, you'll kill it all on the way to 165°F) The problem is that dark meat isn't very good at 165°F. Further complicating this is that if the breast meat gets to the 180°F that the dark meat wants to be cooked to, it's going to be dry, flavorless, and generally unpleasant.

The white meat parts of the turkey are the breasts and wings. The dark meat are the thighs and drumsticks. Now, the wings and drumsticks are going to cook a bit faster than the bits of meat that are better attached to the bird. That said, you want the drumsticks cooked more, so don't worry so much about them. The wings, however, are probably worth attaching more firmly to the bird. You can do this by Imagining you were twisting someone's arm behind their back.  Do this with both wings.  Once you figure out the right twist, you'll find that the tips of the wings will stay firmly in place near the center of the back of the turkey (near its backbone).


Next:
#Preheat the oven to 500°F. (You'll drop the temperature later, but start it hot to get a crispier, more flavorful skin. The effect will be to keep the fat from melting and rolling down the side of the turkey, which is only going to dry it out.) Roast at lowest level of the oven.
#Place the turkey drumstick side down on a roasting tray (with slots to allow drippings through into a pan), or on a rack sitting in a pan.  You will need a basting tool to get the drippings from this pan throughout the roasting process.
#Place the turkey in the oven.
#After about 30 minutes, drop the heat to 350 °F, remove from oven and put a tent of aluminum foil loosely over the breast of the turkey. This is going to keep the breast meat from overcooking and drying out.
#For optimum safety and uniform doneness, it is recommended to cook stuffing outside the bird. #The internal temperature should be checked with a food thermometer and the breast must reach a minimum of 161 °F before removing it from the oven. The thigh, ideally, will be around 180 at this point.  It should take about 2 3/4 to 3 hours to reach this temperature, a 14-16 pound bird should require a total of 2 to 2 1/2hours of roasting. 
#Let the bird stand 15-20 minutes before carving.

==Alternate Recipe==
America's Test Kitchen also had a similar recipe on their show called &quot;The Perfect Roast Turkey&quot;.

===Ingredients===
*4 cups kosher salt or 2 cups table salt
*1 turkey (12 to 14 pounds gross weight), rinsed thoroughly; giblets, neck, and tailpiece removed and reserved to make gravy
*3 medium onions, chopped coarse
*1 1/2 medium carrots, chopped coarse
*1 1/2 celery stalks, chopped coarse
*6 thyme sprigs
*3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

===Instructions===
# Dissolve salt in 2 gallons of cold water in large stockpot or clean bucket. Add turkey and refrigerate or set in very cool (40 degrees or less) spot for 4 to 6 hours.
# Remove turkey from salt water and rinse both cavities and skin under cool running water for several minutes until all traces of salt are gone. Pat dry inside and out with paper towels. Place turkey on meat rack set over rimmed sheet pan. Place turkey in refrigerator, uncovered, and air-dry for at least 8 hours or overnight.
# Adjust oven rack to lowest position, and heat oven to 400 degrees. Toss one-third of onion, carrot, celery, and thyme with 1 tablespoon of melted butter and place this mixture in body cavity. Bring turkey legs together and perform a simple truss.
# Scatter remaining vegetables and thyme over a shallow roasting pan. Pour 1 cup water over vegetables. Set V-rack in pan. Brush entire breast side of turkey with half of remaining butter, then place turkey, breast side down, on V-rack. Brush entire backside of turkey with remaining butter.
# Roast for 45 minutes. Remove pan from oven (close oven door); baste with juices from pan. With wad of paper toweling in each hand, turn turkey, leg/thigh side up. If liquid in pan has totally evaporated, add another 1/2 cup water. Return turkey to oven and roast for 15 minutes. Remove turkey from oven again, baste, and again use paper toweling to turn other leg/thigh side up; roast for another 15 minutes. Remove turkey from oven for final time, baste, and turn it breast side up; roast until breast registers about 165 degrees and thigh registers 170 to 175 degrees on an instant-read thermometer, 30 to 45 minutes. Remove turkey from pan and let rest until ready to carve. Serve with gravy.

'''S'mores''' are a traditional American campfire treat, prepared over an open fire or even in your own home.

==Ingredients==
*4 [[Cookbook:Marshmallow|marshmallows]]
*4 [[Cookbook:Graham Cracker|graham crackers]] (4&quot; x 2&quot; - 10cm x 5cm)
*2 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] (55g) [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]] bar

Makes 4 single serving s'mores

==Preparation==
#Build a [[Do-It-Yourself/Campfire|campfire]] for [[Cookbook:Toasting|toasting]] marshmallows.  
#Find a long stick from the woods (a thin, long wooden dowell may be a good substitute). The stick, which is usually taken from the ground as part of a dead treebranch, does not have to be sterilized, but simply clear of any brush. Alternately, you may purchase a metal roaster stick or jumbo fork. 
#Before roasting the marshmallows, one must prepare the pieces of graham cracker, and a layer of chocolate.  Break the crackers in half, so you have 2 2&quot;x2&quot; (5cm x 5cm) squares for each s'more.  Break the chocolate bar into 1/2 oz (15g) pieces.
#Push a marshmallow on to the end of the stick. Using the stick to place the marshmallow directly above the flame or source of heat, toast the marshmallow until it is golden brown around the outside. Some prefer their marshmallow burned.  Others like to burn the marshmallow and pull off the burned outer skin to get to the gooey center.
#Place the toasted marshmallow in between two pieces of graham cracker, with a layer of chocolate bar in between.  The marshmallow should be hot enough to melt the chocolate.  In a family setting, sometimes it is helpful for children to roast the marshmallows, and adults to supervise and assemble the s'more while preventing the child from touching the hot end of the stick.

*If you do not have a campfire at hand, here is a way to do it in the comfort of your own home:

#Prepare the pieces of graham cracker, and a layer of chocolate.  Break the crackers in half, so you have 2 2&quot;x2&quot; (5cm x 5cm) squares for each s'more.  Break the chocolate bar into 1/2 oz (15g) pieces.
#Place the chocolate on one of the peices of graham cracker, and then place a marshmallow on top.
#Put it in the microwave for 15-25 seconds (depending on the microwave).
#After it has been microwaved, the marshmallow should be much bigger and fluffier and the chocolate should be semi-melted. Place the other half of the graham cracker on top of the marshmallow and squish it down.

==Variations==

70 variations on the basic s'more recipe were published in 2007 in [http://www.smoresbook.com S'mores: Gourmet Treats for Every Occasion] by Lisa Adams. Recipes include:

'''The Patriot'''

*Milk chocolate
*1 graham cracker, broken in half
*Fresh blueberries
*1 marshmallow
*1 thick strawberry slice

Arrange the chocolate on half of the graham cracker. Set blueberries atop chocolate and melt, being careful not to lose the blueberries in transport. Roast the marshmallow. Once chocolate has melted, remove graham cracker from heat and lightly press blueberries to secure them in place. Top with the strawberry slice, roasted marshmallow, and remaining graham cracker. 

'''Minty Brownie'''

*1 marshmallow
*A handful of Junior Mints
*2 brownie squares 

Roast the marshmallow. If desired, melt chocolates on the brownie bottom. Once the chocolates have melted, remove brownie from heat. Add roasted marshmallow and top with remaining brownie square.

'''Tracey’s Caramel Apple'''

*1 marshmallow
*2 chewy caramels
*2 green apple slices, about 1/2 inch thick

Skewer the marshmallow, then the two caramels, on the same roasting stick. Roast the marshmallow and caramels. When the caramels have melted over the top of the marshmallow, and the marshmallow is cooked to your liking, slide the concoction onto one of the apple slices. Top with remaining apple slice. 

'''Belgian s'more'''

*1 Standard s'more ingredients
*2 Red or black licorice

Prepare the s'mores as usual (ie...your favorite recipe...but usually the standard one), then at the end insert either a strip of red or black licorice.

----

S'mores may be prepared at home by toasting the marshmallow over a gas range using a skewer, baked in the oven, cooked on the barbecue, or preassembled in the microwave. Such methods are ideal for parties with kids and adults alike, especially when the host provides a buffet of ingredients and allows everyone to build their own s'mores.

If you must prepare s'mores in the microwave oven, it is important to assemble the ingredients in the correct order.  (Chocolate takes longer to melt than a marshmallow and an overcooked marshmallow is not very tasty.)  This is the process for using chocolate chips instead of pieces of chocolate bar:

On a plate, place the chocolate chips on the graham crackers.  Microwave for 1 minute on High.  Add the marshallows on top.  (For large marshmallows, tear in half before placing on top of melted chocolate.)  Top with another layer of graham crackers.  Microwave for 30 seconds on High.

'''ANZAC biscuits''' have long had an association with the Australia/New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) troops sent to Gallipoli during WWI. The biscuit appears to be a variation of Scottish oat cakes, said to be from the Scottish-influenced city of Dunedin. The recipe was created to ensure the biscuits would keep well during naval transportation to loved ones who were fighting abroad.

==Ingredients==
* 2 cups plain (non - self raising) [[Cookbook:flour|Flour]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 4 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Golden Syrup|golden syrup]] (cane syrup)
* 1 cup desiccated [[Cookbook:Coconut|coconut]]
* 2 cups rolled [[Cookbook:Oats|oats]]
* 225 grams [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]

==Procedure==
#Mix the dry ingredients in a bowl, and melt the syrup and butter in a [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]]. If necessary add a little water to the mix. 
#Mix the wet and dry ingredients and roll into small balls and flatten on oven trays
#[[Cookbook:Baking|Bake]] at 150°C (300°F) for about 15 minutes.

The finished biscuits are quite chewy and crisp, with a long shelf-life.

==Notes, tips, and variations==

# Using brown sugar instead of white sugar gives more colour and flavour
# 1 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda and add a little more water if mixture is too dry

[[Image:Pavlova.png|350px|right]]

'''Pavlova''' is a light and fluffy [[Cookbook:Meringue|meringue]] dessert named after the ballet dancer Anna Pavlova.  Both Wellington, New Zealand and Perth, Australia claim to be the home of the dish. The earliest record of the recipe is a cookbook published in New Zealand in 1933, two years before claims made in Perth.

Pavlova is traditionally decorated with fresh [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]] and whipped [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]], and is especially popular in Australia and New Zealand. Factory-made pavlovas can be purchased at supermarkets in those countries and decorated as desired. 

Leftover pavlova can be stored in the fridge overnight, but will absorb moisture from the air and lose its crispness. Undecorated pavlova can safely be left overnight in the oven in which it was baked, to be decorated in the morning.

A popular tried and true recipe contains the following:

==Ingredients==
*3 [[Cookbook:Egg White|egg whites]]
*3 tablespoons water
*250g (9 oz.) [[Cookbook:Caster Sugar|caster sugar]]
*pinch of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*5 ml or 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
*5 ml or 1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla extract]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]] (optional)

==Procedure==
#Beat the egg whites and salt to a very stiff consistency. Add water and beat again before folding in caster sugar, vanilla and vinegar. Beat until the mixture holds its shape and stands in sharp peaks.
#Pour the mixture onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Slow-bake the mixture at 150°C (300°F) to dry all the moisture and create the meringue, approximately 45 minutes. This leaves the outside of the pavlova a crisp crunchy shell, while the interior remains soft and moist.
#A top tip (but not traditional) is to turn the pavlova upside down before decorating with cream and fruit because the bottom is less crispy than the top after cooking and unless you serve it immediately after decorating the &quot;top&quot; absorbs moisture from the cream. Another tip is to leave the pavlova in the oven after turning off the heat - this helps to prevent the middle of the pavlova from collapsing (although if it does collapse, generous application of cream can hide any mistakes!)

'''Christmas pudding''' is the dessert traditionally served on [[Cookbook:Holiday Recipes#Christmas|Christmas]] day in the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] (especially [[Cookbook:Cuisine of England|England]]) and some other Commonwealth countries such as Australia, New Zealand and Canada.  It is sometimes known as '''plum pudding''', though this can also refer to other kinds of boiled pudding involving a lot of dried fruit.

The pudding needs to be made and cooked well in advance, to allow the flavours to mix (and to save the cook labour on Christmas day); it is merely reheated when it is to be eaten.

The following is a Sussex recipe for Christmas pudding that is known to have been in annual use for over 50 years without a break, and is believed to have been used largely unaltered since the late nineteenth century, despite the difficulties in gathering the ingredients during the rationing in force in the UK in two world wars.  All measurements are in imperial units (with metric measurements in brackets), generally meaning that volume measurements are 20% larger than with the Queen Anne units used in the USA.  Originally, twice or even four times these quantities would have been made.

(As an aside; Jane Grigson notes in her wonderful book &quot;English Food&quot; that Mrs Beeton's recipe for Steak and Kidney pudding was sent in by a correspondent from Sussex and mentions that by the 1850s, when Mrs Beeton was writing, that Sussex had been famous for its puddings for at least a century.  Mrs Grigson thus conjectured that steak and kidney pudding also had its origins in Sussex.  The most famous pudding indubitably linked to the county is Sussex Pond Pudding, the most magnificient of all suet puddings.)

==Ingredients==
To make '''two''' [[Cookbook:Pint|1-pint]] (1.1 litres) puddings ('''remember:''' use the same measurements throughout (imperial or metric))
*½ [[Cookbook:Pound|pound (lb)]] (225g) [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisin]]s
*¾ lb (340g) [[Cookbook:Currant|currant]]s
*½ lb (225g) [[Cookbook:Sultana|sultana]]s
*½ lb (225g) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] (or less)
*¾ lb (340g) shredded [[Cookbook:Suet|suet]] (can be vegetarian; see note below)
*½ lb (225g) [[Cookbook:Bread|breadcrumb]]s
*¼ lb (110g) [[crystallised peel]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons (tsp)]] [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] (55g) [[Cookbook:Almond|almond]]s (chopped, but not too small)
*1/3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (about 60g) [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1/3 [[Cookbook:Pint|pint]] (about 190ml) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*3 large [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]s (beaten)
*[[Cookbook:Brandy|Brandy]]
*Juice and rind of 1 [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]
*1/3 of a [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]]

==Method==
#Mix and stir well.
#Place in pudding basins, and cover with cloths or buttered greaseproof paper, tied tightly in place with string.
#[[Cookbook:Steaming|Steam]] for 7 hours and keep till Christmas day.
#To prepare for serving, steam for 2 hours.  Times can be reduced by using a [[Cookbook:Pressure cooker|pressure cooker]].

==Notes==

*Suet can be difficult to find in some countries, e.g. the USA.  Butter is an excellent substitute. Some recipes may tell you that you have to freeze and grate the butter, but this doesn't work properly. The butter immediately starts softening and forms a giant cold lump. A better way to incorporate the butter in the mixture, is to melt it in a microwave or saucepan, and pouring in into your mixing bowl.  
*It was common practice to include small silver coins in the pudding mixture, which could be kept by the person whose serving included them.  The usual choice was a silver 3d piece (the threepence), or a sixpence.  However this practice fell away once real silver coins were not available, as it was believed that alloy coins would taint the pudding.

*Once turned out of its basin, the Christmas pudding is traditionally decorated with a spray of holly, then dowsed in brandy, flamed, and brought to the table ceremonially - where it should be greeted with a round of applause.  It is best eaten with [[Cookbook:Brandy Butter|brandy butter]], [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]] (lemon cream is excellent) or [[Cookbook:Custard|custard]].  Christmas puddings have very good keeping properties and many families keep one back from Christmas to be eaten at another celebration later in the year.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Portugal|Portugal]] | [[Cookbook:Dessert|Dessert]] | [[Cookbook:Cake|Cake]]

This is the recipe for the traditional '''Madeira Honey Cake''', usually made on Christmas but also all year round on the island of Madeira and originally named in Portuguese ''bolo de mel''.

==Ingredients==
*9 ounces (250 g) [[Cookbook:Bread dough|bread dough]] from the baker's shop
*90 ounces (2.5 kg) [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*35 ounces (1 kg) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*26 ounces (750 g) ''banha'', this is [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] fat
*17 ounces (500 g) [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*1 ounce (25 g) ''erva-doce'', this is [[Cookbook:Anise|Anise]] herbs, mashed and sifted
*1.75 ounce (50 g) ''canela'' ([[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]])
*1 ounce (25 g) ''cravinho da India'', ([[Cookbook:Clove|Clove]]s in powder form)
*17 ounces (500 g) [[Cookbook:Walnut|walnut]], cut into halves
*9 ounces (250 g) ground [[Cookbook:Almond|almond]]s
*1.75 ounce (50 g) candied [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]] peel, cut into cubes
*60 ounces (1.8 l) pure [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]]
*5 tablespoons of [[Cookbook:Baking soda|baking soda]], dissolved in the wine
*1 cup of [[Cookbook:Madeira|Madeira]] wine
*juice and [[Cookbook:Zest|zest]] of 4 [[Cookbook:Orange|orange]]s

==Procedure==

#One day before making the cake, buy the bread-dough at the baker's shop, sprinkle a little bit of flour on the dough, put it in a towel and keep it in a warm place until the next day.   
#Put the baking soda into the Madeira wine, dissolve. In a pan warm up the honey, mix the butter and pork fat (if not available, just use butter), dissolve. Let this mixture cool.  
#Sift flour into a bowl, mix in the sugar, make a well and put the bread dough into it. Now work the flour-sugar mixture into the bread dough. As soon as this is well joined, start to incorporate little by little the (tepid) honey-fat mixture.   Add some of the candied lemon peel, as well as the Madeira wine, orange juice and orange zest, anise, cinnamon, and cloves. 
#Incorporate and knead thoroughly until the dough doesn't stick to the bowl. Cover the dough with a towel and put it in a warm spot. Keep it in a warm place for 3-4 days. 
#Divide the dough into parts of 250g or 500g or 750 g, depending on the pans to put into the oven.  This cake is made in wide, round pans which are rather low.  Before going into the oven, the cake is decorated with half-walnuts, sliced almonds and the rest of the candied lemon peel.  
#Grease the baking pans. Bake about 50 minutes 355 °F (180 °C). Let cool down before taking it out of the baking pan.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*In Madeira these honey cakes are made on 8 December, which is traditionally considered the day of Mary's Immaculate Conception, because tradition says this cake is only good for Christmas if it is made on this day.
*It is a custom to make enough of this cake in order to have some during the whole year. Once cooled and thoroughly wrapped into vegetable paper it remains good until next Christmas without losing quality or taste.
*Another tradition surrounding this cake is that it is not cut with knives, but by hand, and also eaten by hand, nothing more than a tradition but very respected among Madeira locals.

{{recipesummary|Sauce recipes|2|30 minutes|2}}

==Ingredients==	 
*¾ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (about 170 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) roasted [[Cookbook:Peanut|peanut]]s (unsalted)	
*4 cups (about 1 [[Cookbook:L|L]]) [[Cookbook:Coconut Milk|coconut milk]] (unsweetened)	 
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbsp.]] (about 30 mL) [[Cookbook:Red Curry Paste|red curry paste]]	 
*2 tbsp. (about 30 mL) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]	 
*3 tbsp. (about 45 mL) [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]	 
*3 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp.]] (about 15 mL) [[Cookbook:Fish Sauce|fish sauce]]	 
	 
==Procedure==	 
#Chop or grind peanuts into a fine meal.	 
#Heat half the coconut milk in a medium [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]] on high heat, and add red curry paste. Stir until curry paste is dissolved and then continue to heat on high for 10 - 12 minutes (not stirring) until the oil from the coconut milk has risen to the top.	 
#Decrease heat to medium-high and add ground peanuts. Stir and add the rest of the coconut milk, bring to a full boil then decrease heat, add the sugar, lemon juice and fish sauce.	 
#Continue to cook (stirring occasionally) for 15-20 minutes, until the sauce has thickened and the oil has risen to the surface again.	 
#Take off heat and let set for about half an hour. Stir to blend in the oil that has risen, the sauce should be not quite as thick as peanut butter. If it seems too thick add about a teaspoon of water or coconut milk.	 
	 
Enjoy this as a dip or sauce on most any [[Cookbook:Grilling|grilled]] [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]], or thin with water to [[Cookbook:Marinating|marinate]] or use as a [[Cookbook:Dressing|dressing]].

Many French regions claim '''coq au vin''', or chicken stew, as their own, but legend has it that the recipe originated with [[w:Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s chef. Different variants exist throughout the country; the following recipe is one.

Serves 4-6.

==Ingredients==

* 3 [[Cookbook:Pound|lb]] (1.5 [[Cookbook:kg|kg]]) [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]], cut up
* 1 [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], [[Cookbook:Dice|diced]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]], [[Cookbook:Chop|chopped]]
* 3 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbsp]] (45 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] ([[Cookbook:Wheat|wheat]] or [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]])
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] (3 mL) [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1/4 tsp (1 ml) [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* 1/2 lb (200 [[Cookbook:g|g]]) small [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]] (optional)
* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (240 ml) [[Cookbook:Red Wine|red wine]] or Burgundy Wine
* 1 clove [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], [[Cookbook:Mincing|minced]]
* 1 tsp (5 ml) [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]], chopped and fresh
* 1 tsp  of fresh or dried Thyme  crushed

==Directions==
#Mix flour, salt and pepper. Coat chicken, onion and carrot in flour mixture and set aside. 
#[[Cookbook:Sautéing|Sauté]] mushrooms, set aside. 
#[[Cookbook:Browning|Brown]] the chicken pieces a few at a time, set aside. 
#Brown onions and carrots. Put chicken into large [[Cookbook:Casserole (pot)|casserole]] on medium-high heat along with onions, carrots and mushrooms. 
#Combine wine, garlic, and basil; pour over chicken. Cover the casserole, cook until chicken is ready (1-1.5 hours), stirring occasionally.
1 tsp. crushed dried tyme

==Variations==
Nearly all recipes other than those altered for low-fat diets start with [[Cookbook:Lardon|lardons]], or their more available substitutes, unsmoked [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]] or [[Cookbook:Pancetta|pancetta]].  The lardons are cooked, and the rendered fat used for browning the other ingredients, and (with the addition of the flour) to form the ''[[Cookbook:Roux|roux]]'' which thickens the sauce.  Generally, a full bottle of red wine is used, and brandy may be added.

Porcini mushrooms, while not particularly authentic, are good in this dish.

'''Ratatouille''' is a traditional [[Provence|Proven&amp;ccedil;al]] stewed vegetable dish that can be served as a meal on its own, accompanied by [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]], [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] or French [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]], or as a side dish.

Recipe serves 3-4. Increase quantities to serve more, and add different vegetables as desired for variation.

==Ingredients==
* [[Cookbook:Olive oil|Olive oil]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* 1 clove [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Eggplant|eggplant (aubergine)]]
* 1 green [[Cookbook:Bell pepper|bell pepper]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Zucchini|zucchinis (courgettes)]] ([[Cookbook:Cucumber|cucumber]] also works well)
* 6 medium [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]]es, ripe (juicy) and peeled
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste
* [[Cookbook:Herbes de Provence|Herbes de Provence]] to taste

==Directions==

#Put a large [[Cookbook:Casserole (pot)|casserole]] on the stove on medium heat. 
#[[Cookbook:Chop|Chop]] the onions and garlic. When the casserole is hot, add enough olive oil to just cover the bottom. 
#Add the onions and garlic and [[Cookbook:Brown|brown]].
#Chop the green pepper, zucchinis and eggplant. Add to the casserole. Stir from time to time.
#Peel the tomatoes. [[Cookbook:Dice|Dice]] them or cut them into quarters, add to the casserole. 
#Five minutes later, check to see if the tomatoes have made enough juice to almost cover the vegetables - if so, perfect. If not, add water as needed (not too much).
#Add salt, pepper and Herbes de Provence to taste. In general, 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbsp]] of salt, 1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] of pepper and 1 tbsp of the herbs will suffice. 
#Cover the casserole and let simmer on low heat for 45 minutes to 1 hour.

[[Image:Crepes dsc07085.jpg|thumb|Crêpes without any fillings]]

A '''crêpe''' is a thin [[Cookbook:Pancake|pancake]]. It originates from [[w:Brittany|Brittany]], a region in the west of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|France]], where it is traditionally served with [[Cookbook:Cider|cider]]. Historically, they were cooked on flat rocks (hence the name). Crêpes are usually of two types: sweet or savoury, the main difference is the [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] used (plain flour or [[Cookbook:Buckwheat|buckwheat]] flour respectively). They may then be rolled or folded, and filled with different ingredients.

This recipe for sweet crêpes is an easy one to start with (for about 20 crêpes):

==Ingredients==
* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (230 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) plain [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] 
* 1/2 cup (115 mL) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 4 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]s
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbsp]] (15 mL) [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] or melted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* 1 pinch of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

==Variations==
Sweeter crêpe:
Add 2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] and 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]]

[[Cookbook:Chocolate|Chocolate]] Crêpe:
Add 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Chocolate_Sauce|chocolate sauce]]

See [[Crepe Making in Depth|Zen of Crepe Making]] for extra help.

An easy variation to the recipe is: 

5 eggs 
1 cup of flour
1 cup of milk

==Procedure==
#Put the flour at the bottom of a [[Cookbook:Mixing Bowl|mixing bowl]] and make a hole in the middle where you put the eggs, the oil or butter, the salt and a bit of milk. 
#Mix and slowly incorporate the flour, you should get a thick paste. Then continue mixing and slowly add the rest of the milk, mix well to avoid making lumps. You may add a bit of [[Cookbook:Liqueur|liqueur]] (traditionally [[Cookbook:Brandy|brandy]] or [[Cookbook:Fleur d'Oranger|fleur d'oranger]]) for more taste. You may even replace part or all of the milk with [[Cookbook:Beer|beer]]!
#Heat a [[Cookbook:Crêpe Pan|crêpe pan]] (non-stick recommended), grease it with some butter, and pour some batter while rolling the pan to make the crêpe as thin as possible.  A drop of water can be used to test the pan temperature: too cold, and the water will sit on the pan, too hot and it will vanish immediately.  At the right temperature, the water will seem to &quot;dance&quot; on the pan.
#Cooking may take 30 to 60 seconds until the cooked side looks like the surface of the moon, then turn it over to cook the other side; with some practice, you can flip it in the air by swinging the pan. See the [[Cookbook:Pancake|pancake]] recipe for air-flipping instructions.

Serve with [[Cookbook:Caster Sugar|caster sugar]], jam, spreads, etc.

Crêpes can be filled and folded into triangles or rolled up.  

Some tasty fillings include:
* [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] and [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]
* [[Cookbook:Raspberry|raspberry]] jam &amp; chocolate sauce
* [[Cookbook:Nutella|nutella]] &amp; sliced [[Cookbook:Banana|banana]]
* nutella &amp; chopped [[Cookbook:Hazelnut|hazelnuts]]
* [[Cookbook:Whipped Cream|whipped cream]]
* chocolate, [[Cookbook:Caramel|caramel]] or [[Cookbook:Butterscotch|butterscotch]] sauce
* [[Cookbook:Peanut Butter|peanut butter]]
* sugar and butter, possibly with [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]] or [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
* [[Cookbook:Strawberry|strawberries]], fresh or frozen
* [[Cookbook:Cream Cheese|cream cheese]] and brown sugar

Cooking '''oysters''' - from the 1881 ''Household Cyclopedia''



=== Stewed Oysters ===
''Recipe moved to [[Cookbook:Stewed Oysters]]''

=== Oysters Roasted ===
''Recipe moved to  [[Cookbook:Roasted Oysters with Madeira]]''

=== Another Mode ===
''Recipe moved to [[Cookbook:Simple Roasted Oysters]]'' 

=== Scalloped Oysters ===

One hundred oysters, a baker's loaf crumbed, four eggs boiled hard; salt and cayenne pepper to taste. Chop the eggs very fine and mix with the crumbs, which season highly with cayenne and salt. Cover the bottom of a deep pie-dish with the eggs and crumbs; then with a fork, place layer of oysters with two or three small pieces of butter, and so continue until all are in, reserving sufficient crumbs for the cover For those who like it, a little mace may be added. Bake in a quick oven three-quarters of an hour. Serve hot. 

=== Fried Oysters ===
''Recipe moved to [[Cookbook:Breaded Fried Oysters]]'' 

=== Panned Oysters ===

Take fifty large oysters, remove every particle of shell which may adhere to them, put them in to a colander and pour over a little water to rinse them. After letting them drain, put them into a stewpan with a quarter of a pound of butter, salt' black and red pepper to taste. Put them over a clear fire, and stir while cooking. As soon as they commence to shrink remove them from the fire, and send to table hot in a well (covered) heated dish. 

=== To Pickle Oysters ===

Drain off the liquor from one hundred oysters, wash them and put to them a table-spoonful of salt and a tea-cup of vinegar; let them simmer over the fire about ten minutes, taking off the scum as it rises; then take out the oysters and put to their own liquor a tablespoonful of whole black pepper and a teaspoonful of mace and cloves; let it boil five minutes, skim and pour it over the oysters in a jar. 

=== To Spice Oysters ===

One hundred oysters, one dozen cloves, two dozen allspice, mace, cayenne pepper, and salt to taste. 

Strain the liquor through a sieve, put it in a saucepan, and add the oysters, spice, pepper, salt, and half a pint of cider vinegar. Place them over a slow fire, and as soon as they boil take them off. Pour them into a large bowl and set them away to cool. When cold cover them close.

=== Oysters Kilpatrick ===
Oysters Kilpatrick can be made in one of 2 ways. To begin you need to make the Kilpatrick sauce which is 1 part Tomato Sauce to 1 part Worcestershire Sauce which is throughly mixed together. The next step is to finely dice bacon into small pieces which is then placed over the raw oysters. Once the bacon pieces are placed over the oysters quite generously, then pour the Kilpatrick sauce over the top of the oysters and bacon. Now the oysters can be placed in a oven proof frying pan with a stable base for the oysters and baked at a moderate temperate (180 degrees Celcius) until the oysters are firm to the touch and bacon is crispy. The oysters can also be placed in a tray under a grill with a high heat until firm and bacon is crispy. Serve the Kilpatrick oysters with either lemon wedges or additional Kilpatrick sauce.

This is how to cook [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]], the Italian way.

Depending on your recipe, you might have to start preparing sauces or other additions before making the actual pasta. The general rule is that the sauce should wait for the pasta, not the other way around.

This method of boiling applies to most types of pasta. When the water is still cold, add some salt to it. The quantity of salt depends on the amount of water and the salt's particular intensity (some salts are &quot;lighter&quot; than others). On average, for every 200 grams of pasta you need 4 liters of water and 2 tablespoons of salt. The amount of salt varies according to the volume of water, not the amount of pasta. Thus, if you were to find yourself using more water than is necessary, you must also add more salt.

Moisten the salt with water until it dissolves. When the water boils, throw in your pasta and start measuring the time. Do not put pasta in the water until it has started boiling, or you will get something very distant from what is generally considered satisfactory pasta. Alternatively, boil the water first, then add the salt, wait until the water returns to a boil (this should happen very quickly), and then add the pasta. 
 
The length of time differs for each kind of pasta (generally, the box suggests a boiling time), and goes from 5 minutes for thin spaghettini to 12 and up minutes for some thicker kinds. A bit less time than suggested will produce a firmer pasta (al dente - heavy to digest, however) while a bit more time causes pasta to be more flexible. It is a good idea to follow the suggestions on the box until you are sufficiently experienced in making pasta. Fresh, egg-based pasta (''pasta all'uovo'') takes very little time to cook. Fresh [[Cookbook:Noodle|noodles]] hardly need a minute after the water has returned to the boil; filled pasta like [[Cookboook:tortellini|tortellini]] need only a few minutes to cook through. Many experienced cooks like to sample a piece of the pasta while boiling it (''spizzicatura'' - they &quot;fish&quot; it out with a slotted spoon) to stop cooking just at their desired consistency. When boiling time is completed, separate pasta from water with a strainer, put in a wide dish and add everything else. A suggestion: a simple combination of butter and Parmigiano Reggiano, or some oil, parsley or basil and fresh garlic, will be as tasty as more sophisticated preparations. Serve the pasta hot, immediately, unless the recipe says differently.

== Ingredients ==
* 1 small pork stomach (order at your butcher)
* 375 g fatless pork belly (German ''Schweinebauch'')
* 375 g pork meat
* 375 g ground meat (German ''Bratwurstfüllsel'')
* 1-2 rolls (put in some milk)
* 1 kg boiled [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]]
* 3 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]]
* 1 bunch of [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]]
* 1-2 cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], 
* [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* [[Cookbook:Marjoram|marjoram]]
* [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]]

==Procedure==
Soak the pork stomach overnight and use twine to close two of the three apertures. Cut the meat and potatoes into small cubes. Stew the onions, carrots, and parsley in butter. Squeeze the garlic. Mix everything with the rolls and eggs and spice it well; then put everything into the pork stomach and close the third aperture. Put the stomach in hot water and cook for 2-3 hours. The water '''must not boil!''' Cut the stomach in 2 cm thick slices and serve them with mashed potatoes and sauerkraut. Alternatively you can store the cooked stomach in the fridge and fry it when you are ready to eat it.

'''Pico de Gallo''' has two meanings in Mexican cuisine.  The most familiar to North Americans is a fresh, tomato-based condiment.  It is what North Americans usually mean when talking about &quot;salsa&quot; or &quot;tomato salsa.&quot;  This salsa is never cooked.  

The second meaning, more common in some regions of Mexico, is a spice mixture including salt and dried chiles which is served, often with lime juice, over fresh fruit.    If you are unfamiliar with the regional origin of a recipe involving pico de gallo, context may be the only way to determine which meaning is intended, though for US-Mex dishes the &quot;uncooked salsa&quot; meaning will almost always be correct.

== Ingredients ==

*2 cups chopped fresh tomato
*&amp;frac12; cup chopped white or yellow [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] chopped [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]]
*&amp;frac12; [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*2 teaspoons freshly squeezed [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]] juice
*1 teaspoon ground [[Cookbook:Black Pepper|black pepper]]
*1 &amp;frac12; tablespoons stemmed, seeded, and minced [[Cookbook:Jalapeño|jalapeño]] or other chiles
*1 small clove of garlic, minced
*[[Cookbook:Hot Sauce|hot sauce]], to taste

== Directions ==

#Dice the vegetables.
#Combine them, mixing well. 
#Add salt, pepper, chiles, lime juice, and garlic.
#Add hot sauce if desired.

'''Roux''' is a base sauce in international cuisines, originally [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|French]], composed of varying ratios of [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] and [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]] (usually [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]), useful for making sauces, and for thickening [[Cookbook:Soup|soups]] or [[Cookbook:Gravy|gravies]]. It can be cooked to different degrees (white roux, blonde roux or brown roux) depending upon the intended use, and a darker roux (one that has been cooked longer) will also be thicker, but will have less thickening power.

== Ingredients ==
A basic roux may be composed of equal parts [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] and [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], e.g. 1 cup of each

== Procedure ==
# Melt the butter in a thick-bottomed sauce pan over medium heat, then add flour. 
# Mix well and cook to desired color, stirring constantly to prevent burning. This may well take up to twenty minutes.

== Oven-Made Roux ==
Some people find it easier to finish a roux in the oven so as not to burn it with direct heat.

===Ingredients===
#3 cups peanut oil
#4½ cups flour

===Procedure===
Preheat oven to 400°F (205°C). Heat the oil in a skillet for 10 minutes on medium-high. Stir constantly for 15 minutes until roux starts to brown. Place the skillet in the oven and cook for 1 hour stirring every 15-20 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 and cook for an additional stirring every 15-20 minutes until your roux reaches the desired doneness. The roux may be stored in the freezer in an airtight container indefinitely.

== Notes, tips and variations ==
* Depending upon how you plan to use your roux, you may need to add the sauce's other ingredients before the roux is fully cooked.
* One way to use a roux, is to add liquid to it, stirring it in as you go. Don't go the other way, adding the roux to the liquid, as you will get lumps. Once enough liquid has been added to the roux (you'll know), you can safely add it back into another liquid. 
* A good roux will have a slight shine to it, and neither the texture nor the taste of the flour will be apparent.
* When making a dark roux, switching from butter to an oil with a high [[Cookbook:Smoke Point|smoke point]] (such as [[Cookbook:Soybean Oil|soybean oil]] or [[Cookbook:Canola Oil|Canola oil]]) will allow for a higher cooking temperature, decreasing cooking time. Keep in mind that different fats will give the roux a somewhat different taste.

'''Gentgeen's Campfire Trout''' is the recipe [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] uses to cook trout caught while camping.  This method can be used at home with trout purchased at the fish market, but somehow never tastes quite as good.

== Ingredients ==
* 2 whole cleaned [[Cookbook:Trout|trout]], between 10 and 14 inches
* 4 strips [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]]
* 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]], [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]], to taste

Serves 4, or 2 hungry fishermen.

== Procedure ==
# Make a pan out of [[Cookbook:Aluminum foil|aluminum foil]] slightly larger than your two fish.  The pan should have a double layer of foil on the bottom and a lip around the edge of about 3/4 - 1 inch height. 
# Place the pan on a grill over the campfire.  Put the butter into the pan and allow to begin melting.  Wrap each trout with 2 strips of bacon. Add the trout to the pan. Season to taste.
# After the trout has cooked for a few minutes (5-7 depending on the size of the fish), check the inside.  If the side close to the fire is white and flakes easily, the fish is ready to turn.  Flip the fish, and continue cooking the other side for 3-4 minutes until done.

Serve with lemon over a bed of white [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]].

'''Mille Feuille''' is a [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|French]] cake made of many [[Cookbook:Crêpe|pastry]] layers. &quot;Mille&quot; (&quot;mil&quot;) means &quot; a thousand,&quot; implying the many layers of puff pastry.


==Ingredients==
=== Pastry ===
*375g of ready-made [[Cookbook:Puff pastry|puff pastry]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] 
*2 level tablespoon [[Cookbook:Icing sugar|icing sugar]] 

=== Lemon Butter Cream ===
*3 egg yolks plus 1 whole egg 
*75g [[Cookbook:Caster sugar|caster sugar]] 
*40g plain [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] 
*zest and juice of 3 large [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]s, 
*275 ml [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]

==Procedure==
===Pastry===
#Unroll the pastry on a lightly floured surface.
#Trim the pastry so that you are left with a rectangle approximately 23 x 25.5 cm.
#Roll out the larger piece of pastry to a 30cm square, make sure you use a very even, gentle pressure on the rolling pin so that you end up with nice even edges.
#Grease the baking sheet and use a rolling pin to transer the pastry to the baking sheet.
#Prick the surface of the pastry with a fork. Brush the pastry all over with the beaten egg.
#Place the baking sheet on a high shelf in the preheated oven and bake for 12-15 minutes (a very crisp finish is need).
#Then to get it really extra crisp, preheat the oven to its highest setting, sift 1 teaspoon of the icing sugar all over the pastry, flash it under the grill.
#Remove from the grill and, using a sharp knife, cut the square into three equal strips.
#Turn them over, sift over the rest of the icing and then flash them under the grill again.
#Once it has cooled on the wire rack, the pastry is ready to use and can be stored in a polythene box, each layer separated with greaseproof paper.

===Lemon Butter Cream===
#Place the egg yolks and whole egg into a nice roomy bowl.
#Use an electric mixer to whisk the eggs together with the sugar until the mixture is pale, thick and creamy (4-5 minutes). Add the milk as you mix.
#Sift the flour onto the mixture and whisk again until smooth.
#Add the lemon zest.

===Final steps===
#Place a pastry strip on the plate, and cover with half the lemon creme.
#Put the second pastry strip on the creme, and cover with the remaining lemon creme.
#Finally, add the final pastry strip.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Sauce|Sauce]]

It's hard to believe that [[Cookbook:Pizza|pizza]] originally did not contain tomatoes! Tomatoes originated from the Americas, and didn't reach Italy until the mid-1500s. They didn't get popular until the late 1800s though, because people thought they were poisonous. Now, however, tomato sauce is considered an essential part of pizza. Want to make it at home? Here's the way to get that great &quot;pizzeria&quot; taste in your sauce, with all the &quot;what&quot;s and &quot;how&quot;s.

==Variations on a Theme==
There are two recipes featured here, depending on what you have and how much work you would like to put in.

*The '''Store Bought Plus''' recipe is for those who want a quick yet improved pizza sauce, using tomato sauce and sugar.

*The '''Sauce from Scratch''' recipe is for those who have the time (preparation only - no cooking required!) to mix the ingredients for a purer and more customized taste.

==Store Bought Plus==
===Ingredients===

Note: the amounts of ingredients must be calculated proportionately with the pizza. As such, measurements cannot be determined without a &quot;hands-on&quot; calculation made during procedure.

*1 can smooth spaghetti sauce or pasta sauce
*1 handful [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*extra virgin olive oil (optional)

===Procedure===
After rolling out dough, ladle on sauce as directed by the pizza recipe, then grab a handful of sugar and drizzle it on, until the surface of the sauce becomes white - however, it should remain possible to see the crystals dissolving.

The sugar covers the taste of the acidity and vegetal character of the sauce.  Sugar is the secret to a pizza that tastes like one from many American fast-food franchise pizza outlets like Domino's and Pizza Hut.

A common modification is to drizzle high-quality [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|extra virgin olive oil]] onto sauce on pizza, or to pre-brush the dough with oil before adding the sauce.

==Sauce from Scratch==
===Ingredients===
* 6-[[Cookbook:Ounce|ounce]] can of [[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomato paste]] (with no additives is best)
* 1 to 1 1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] of water (depending on desired consistency)
* ~ 1/3 cup extra virgin [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]] (more or less depending on taste)
* 1 to 3 cloves minced [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* a pinch of [[Cookbook:Anise|anise]] (or substitute [[Cookbook:Fennel|fennel]])
* around 1/2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] dried [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]] (according to preference)
* around 1/2 tablespoon dried [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]] (according to preference)
* kosher [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and ground [[Cookbook:Black Pepper|black pepper]] to taste

===Procedure===
Combine tomato paste, water, and oil. Add garlic, basil, and oregano, mixing thoroughly. Add salt and pepper to taste. A quart mason jar works perfectly; ingredients can be added and shaken to mix. For best results place in refrigerator overnight or allow the mixture to rest before using. Makes ~1/2 quart.

'''Mjeddrah''' is a stout lentil and rice stew, a Lebanese staple. 

{{see also|Cookbook:Mejadra}}

==Ingredients==
* ½ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] brown [[Cookbook:Lentil|lentils]], soaked an hour or more
* ½ cup long grain [[Cookbook:Rice|brown rice]], rinsed
* 3 cups water
* ½ cup [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], sliced
* ½ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] whole or ground [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste

===Optional===
* [[Cookbook:Mincing|minced]] [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* dried [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili pepper]]
* half a [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]] stick
* a few [[Cookbook:Cardamom|cardamom]] pods
* chopped [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]], [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]], etc. Not too much of this, I think, but a little is good.

==Procedure==
# Pick over the lentils to remove any stones. 
# [[Cookbook:Sautéing|Sauté]] the onion and any other vegetables in the olive oil for a minute or two. Optionally, sauté the rice for a short time but do not let it burn.
# Add the water and other ingredients, bring to a boil, and simmer, covered, for  40 minutes to an hour. You will have to check it occasionally and add water - the final product should  have some liquid but should not be very soupy. It is finished when the rice and lentils are both no longer crunchy.

==Variations==
* A little [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan cheese]] is tasty sprinkled on as a garnish.
* Sauté some chopped onion and garlic quickly in oil until it browns (a slight burning is good), then stir it into some natural [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]] and use as a garnish.

'''Senf''' is German for &quot;mustard&quot;. This particular senf, known as 'Süßer Senf', has a sweet, yet sharp taste that makes it great on sandwiches and crackers.  While this recipe is from a 3rd or 4th generation German American, such recipes are said to originate from the southern parts of Germany (Bavaria).

==Ingredients==
*1.7 oz. dry ground [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]]
*3/4 cup [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1 1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
*1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1/2 tsp. [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*[[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]

==Procedure==
# Mix flour, sugar, mustard, salt, and pepper together, then add vinegar. 
# Stir using a wire whisk to prevent lumps. 
# Simmer on low to medium heat till cooked through and beginning to get thick. 
# Add some water if too thick and if the mustard is too sharp for your taste.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
It gets better as it cools and ages awhile.

'''Zupa ogórkowa''' is a traditional Polish soup made out of sour, salted [[Cookbook:Cucumber|cucumbers]].

==Ingredients==
*4 [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] wings
*1 small [[Cookbook:Leek|leek]] (or 1 small [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]])
*2 [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]]s 
*1/2 [[Cookbook:Celery Root|celery root]] (optional) 
*1 [[Cookbook:Parsnip|parsnip root]]
*3 medium [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]]es
*3 big sour-salted (pickled) [[Cookbook:Cucumber|cucumber]]s
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaves]]
*3 [[Cookbook:Pimento|pimento]]s
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] 
*1 – 2 tablespoon of [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]] or [[Cookbook:Half and Half|half and half]] ([[Cookbook:Yogurt|yoghurt]] is also acceptable, however it isn't traditional then) (optional)

==Procedure==
#Put the chicken wings, salt, pepper, bay leaves and pimentos into a [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]] or [[Cookbook:Stock Pot|stock pot]] with 1.5 [[Cookbook:L|L]] (1 1/2 [[Cookbook:Quart|quarts]]) cold water. After bringing it to a boil, let it simmer for 25 minutes on low heat. 
#Add the peeled carrots, celery root, parsnip root, and leek, and boil it for 10 more minutes. During that time peel the potatoes and dice them into quarter inch (cubes [[Cookbook:Inch|0.4“ x 0.4”]]). 
#Take out the leek, and add the potatoes to the pot. Boil them for 10-12 minutes and make sure the potatoes are cooked through. 
#Now is the time to prepare the pickled cucumber mixture. Grate the sour-salted (pickled) cucumbers and put them into a [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|saute pan]] with the melted butter. Saute for 2 minutes, and add the flour and constantly stir it over low heat. 
#Add 1/2 - 1/3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]]s of water to the saute pan and continue stirring. 
#When the potatoes are cooked, add the prepared sour cucumber preparation to the stock pot and mix them well. Boil for 3-5 minutes and season the soup to taste. If you like, mix some soup with cream or sour cream in a small cup and add it to the pan, or a smaller amount to each individual serving.

''Bon appétit!'' ''Smacznego!''

==Notes, tips, and variations==
It is very important to add the potatoes first, and then the sour cucumbers. If you add them in reverse order, the potatoes will not be cooked through.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Poland|Cuisine of Poland]] | [[Cookbook:Sausage|Sausage]] | [[Cookbook:Meat Recipes|Meat Recipes]] 

'''Wiejska''' is the most popular form of Kielbasa, or Polish sausage, in the United States.

==Ingredients==
*1 1/2 lbs, lean boneless [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]]
*1/2 lb. boneless [[Cookbook:Veal|veal]] (optional)
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Marjoram|marjoram]]
*2-3 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], crushed
*1 Tbsp. [[Cookbook:Mustard seed|mustard seed]]
*1/4 cup crushed ice
*[[Cookbook:Sausage casing|sausage casing]]

==Procedure==
Cut the meat into small chunks, then grind the meat with the seasonings and ice, mix this well.  Stuff the meat mixture into the casing.  Smoke in an outside smoker following the manufacturer's directions, or you can place the sausage in a casserole and cover it with water and bake at 350° F until water is absorbed, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  This makes about 2 lbs.

When making sausage by hand, tie a knot about 3 inches (76 mm) from one end of a cleaned sausage casing and fix the open end over the spout of a wide-based funnel, easing most of the casing up onto the spout.  Then spoon the mixture into the funnel and push it through into the casing with your fingers.  Knot the end and roll the sausage gently on a firm surface to distribute the filling evenly.

==Warning==

While typically this sausage is prepared in a cured form, the above recipe is for fresh sausage.  As such it must be fully cooked before eating in order to prevent food poisoning. Alternatively this sausage can be prepared as a cured product.

==Notes, tips, and variations==

Notes: The purpose of the ice is to keep the fat in the pork solid, which is very important in the final texture of the sausage.  If you do not add the veal then add 1 lb. additional pork

Instead of chicken you may use 1/2 kg (1 lb) of [[Cookbook:Veal|veal]].

[[Image:Bánh mì.jpg|right|thumb|Bánh mì]]
{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Vietnam|Vietnamese Cuisine]] | [[Cookbook:Sandwiches|Sandwiches]]

=Bánh mì: colorful Saigon sandwich=

'''''Bánh mì''''' means 'French sandwich' in Vietnamese.  It may have started as a 'kitchen sink' recipe in Vietnam, where various leftovers would be tossed into a [[Cookbook:Sandwich|sandwich]] to finish them up (like a [[Cookbook:Po' Boy|po' boy]]). Bánh mì is now sought after by many for its unique and delicious flavors.  There are many different types of bánh mì sandwiches, ranging from chunked BBQ grilled [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]], sliced pork pate, and shredded grilled [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]], to grilled and smoked [[Cookbook:Seafood|fish]], [[Cookbook:Sardine|sardine]], meatball, Chinese-style [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausage]], and tripe.  

Choices of bread are also quite varied.  It is customary to use a toasted French [[Cookbook:Baguette|baguette]] or French bread, because of the textures these breads provide: bánh mì tastes best when the outer crust of the bread is firm but not overly hard, and the inner part of the bread is fluffy and light like a yeast roll, that is, one which is not overly dense or spongy.  The reason for this is that the crust's firmness provides a barrier for the moisture of the sandwich, and the lightness of the inner bread does not overwhelm the flavors of the sandwich, which would otherwise make the sandwich taste overly 'bready'.  Still, no sandwich tastes better than the flavor of the bread, so make sure the bread is fresh and flavorful (preferably one from a bakery).  Using a store-bought bread yields unpredictable results as they tend to taste overly processed or they taste like the plastic or paper bag in which they are kept. 

To make a bánh mì sandwich, begin with a toasted French baguette.  Cut a length of baguette in half lengthwise and either remove excess bread from the inner portion of the sandwich by digging out a cavity in the two halves or press into the bread to form trenches. These depressions are where we will put the [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]] and ingredients.

The following are different ingredients used to make bánh mì.  Put in as many as you wish in your sandwich - each is different.  The first list of ingredients are typical bánh mì ingredients, the second list are [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]] ingredients, and the third list are optional other ingredients.  Have fun!

Standard bánh mì ingredients:
* pickled julienned [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]]

* [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]] leaves and stalks
* super-thin [[Cookbook:Jalapeño|jalapeño]] slices

'''Kovaim''' are Hungarian cheese dumplings.

==Ingredients==
===Dough===
*300 g [[Cookbook:Flour|Flour]]
*3 large [[Cookbook:Egg|Egg]]s
*1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Water|Water]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] to taste

===Filling===
Try a dry cheese like dry ricotta for this filling, and some salt. You could add some spicier cheese to the filling like cheddar, or even parmesan, but make sure this is not more than a third of the filling.

==Procedure==
Mix the flour, salt, eggs and water into a dough. Knead it until it is very smooth. Cover the dough in a plastic bowl, and let it rest for at least half an hour. 

Roll the dough out into a sheet as thin as possible (about three millimeters thick). Cut into squares and fill with cheese (or cooked potatoes and onions, or ricotta cheese with sugar for a sweet dumpling). Fold and boil in water for about five minutes.

Serve hot. This recipe goes really well with Cheddar and Ketchup.

'''Silvash Gombotz''' (Plum Dumplings, correct Hungarian spelling: Szilvás gombóc)

This is a traditional dessert recipe from Hungary. During the freezing cold winters, warm filling desserts are very popular.

==Ingredients==

*2 pounds peeled [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
*pinch [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*3 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]
*plain [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*fresh [[Cookbook:Plum|plums]] OR plum [[Cookbook:Jam|jam]]

==Procedure==

Cook two pounds of potatoes until very soft (at least an hour). Peel and mash with a fork. Add an egg to the mixture, a little salt, three tablespoons of oil and enough flour to make it smooth.

This is the best you can get by way of recipes from my granny, I think she means about six or seven tablespoons, and add them one by one.

Knead the potato dough and then roll it out into a thin sheet (about five millimeters thick), and cut into squares. Put half a plum or a teaspoon of plum jam on each square (also works with apricots, in which case the dumplings will be called &quot;barackos gombóc&quot; or &quot;Baratzkosh Gombotz&quot;). Wrap the dough around the filling and seal the edges. Cook in boiling water for ten to fifteen minutes.

Serve with bread crumbs fried in butter.

==Ingredients==
*1 cup  [[Cookbook:Cornmeal|cornmeal]] (polenta)
*4 cups [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste

==Procedure==
===The standard method===

In a heavy [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]], bring the water to a boil.  Add the salt.  Stirring constantly with a stainless steel whisk, pour the cornmeal into the water in a steady stream.  Reduce heat to a slow simmer and keep stirring with the whisk until it starts to boil, then cover and continue to cook, stirring every 2-3 minutes with a wooden spoon, always in the same clockwise direction.  

The time necessary for the porridge to be correctly cooked and thus well-digestable is 45 minutes.  In case the porridge gets too thick, add some hot water or skimmed milk, to obtain a more creamy porridge.  Check frequently if more salt is needed.  

For eating polenta hot from the pan, put a tablespoon of water in a deep ceramic dish and scrape the polenta into it. Serve it with a big wooden spoon.  To eat it roasted, scrape the polenta into a non-stick pan or ceramic dish (or some container which will release it when it cools).  Cool completely.  The polenta will be like a loaf.  To serve it, cut into slices, heat in the oven or grill it and serve with whatever topping you desire.  Even the polenta leftovers from serving it as a hot side dish are usable, cut in slices and grilled.

===The quickie method===

Boil the water on the stove.  Pour it into a large microwave-safe bowl and add the salt. Stiring constantly, pour the cornmeal into the water in a steady stream.  Cook the polenta in a [[Cookbook:Microwave oven|microwave oven]] on medium power for (2&amp;ndash;5 minutes, longer for a larger serving).  Remove from the microwave and stir vigourously.  It will not cook evenly and this stirring helps prevent lumps.  

Repeat this process until the polenta is thick, then proceed as above.

===The really quickie method===

Boil the water, toss in the salt and cornmeal and microwave on medium power for 5&amp;ndash;8 minutes (depending on quantity).  Remove from microwave and stir like crazy to smash all of the lumps.  Repeat if you need to thicken it some more, stir, and blend with the few remaining lumps.

===Variations===
Just before you take the polenta off the heat (i.e., when it's almost done), stir in any of the following.
* Two tablespoons of olive oil or butter and about half a cup of Parmesan cheese.
* Two tablespoons of olive oil, 2-3 cloves of minced garlic, and a quarter cup of chopped sundried tomatoes. (If packed in oil, drain the tomatoes first.)
* Half a cup of canned sweet corn kernels and a quarter cup of sliced green Spanish olives.
* One minced jalapeño chili, seeds removed, and half a cup of cheddar cheese.
* Two tablespoons of butter and about half a cup of crumbled gorgonzola cheese. Top with carmelized onions.

Polenta is also delicious topped with your favorite tomato sauce or with an assortment of grilled vegetables. Chilled, firm polenta may be served cut into triangles alongside chili or other hearty stews. Leftover polenta may be cut into strips or triangles, coated in seasoned bread crumbs and grated Parmesan cheese, and fried in olive oil. Like pasta, the possibilities for this versatile dish are virtually endless, so feel free to experiment with additions and toppings.

'''Lemonade''' is a sweetened beverage made from lemons, sugar, and water.  It is popular in the United States during the spring and summer, when it is generally served chilled, with ice.

In some countries, the word 'lemonade' is also used to describe any clear carbonated drink; in others, it means any fruit-flavored soda. 

==Ingredients==
*6 medium [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemons]], should yield 1 cup of juice
*3 1/2 cups [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
*3/4 cup [[Cookbook:Sugar|Sugar]] (can be adjusted by +/- 1/4 cup to taste)

==Procedure==
# Juice the lemons on a [[Cookbook:Citrus reamer|citrus reamer]]. Rolling the lemons on the counter with moderate pressure prior to juicing will result in more juice from each lemon.  Try to keep out the seeds.  If you prefer lemonade with no pulp, strain the juice to remove it.
# Dissolve the sugar in the water. Heat may be helpful if using a large amount of sugar.
# Combine the juice and sugar water in a pitcher.  Stir well.
# Chill or serve over ice cubes.

==Alternative Recipe==

* 1 cup Lemon Juice
* 1 cup Sugar
* 6 Cups of Water (2 cups warm water, 4 cups cold water)

# Pour 2 cups of warm water into a pitcher and stir in sugar until it dissolves (Sugar dissolves quicker in warm water).
# Pour in lemon juice, stir again, and add the 4 cups of cold water.
# Chill or serve over ice cubes.

==Variations==
*[[Cookbook:Hard lemonade|Hard lemonade]] adds an alcoholic spirit, such as tequila, gin, or vodka, to the lemonade.
*Various fruits, such as [[Cookbook:Strawberry|strawberries]] and [[Cookbook:Raspberry|raspberries]] can be added for color and flavor.  A small amount of [[Cookbook:Beet|beet]] juice results in pink lemonade with little change in flavor.
*[[Cookbook:Herb|Herb]]s such as [[Cookbook:Mint|mint]], [[Cookbook:Borage|borage]], [[Cookbook:Lavender|lavender]], and [[Cookbook:Lemon verbena|lemon verbena]] can change the aroma of the drink.
*Including the peels, bruised and sliced, gives more bite and a stronger aroma.
*Other citrus fruits can be used, including [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]], [[Cookbook:Orange|orange]], and [[Cookbook:Grapefruit|grapefruit]].  Sugar and water content should be adjusted to taste.  In American parlance, these are not technically lemonades, but limeade, orangeade, etc.

Makes up to 6 large portions.

==Ingredients==

===For the stew===
*4 medium [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]]es
*4-5 large [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]]s
*2 medium sized [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]s
*1 (or more) cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
*4-5 sticks of [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]]
*1 large green [[Cookbook:Bell pepper|bell pepper]]
*1 large red bell pepper
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]] puree (or paste)
*1 tin (400g) tomatoes, chopped
*1 tin (260g) [[Cookbook:Butter bean|butter bean]]s or [[Cookbook:Chickpeas|chickpeas]] (or a mix of both)
*1/2 cup (200g) frozen or fresh garden [[Cookbook:Pea|peas]]
*2 teaspoons vegan [[Cookbook:Vegetable stock|vegetable stock]]
*1 dessert spoon (2.5 teaspoons) [[Cookbook:Yeast Extract spread|yeast extract spread]] ([[Cookbook:Marmite|Marmite]])
*2 level tablespoons [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*[[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]] or [[Cookbook:Olive oil|olive oil]] (or a mixture of both)
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and ground [[Cookbook:Black pepper|black pepper]] to taste

===For the dumplings===
*110g (4oz) [[Cookbook:flour|self-raising flour]]
*50g (2oz) margarine
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking powder|baking powder]] (optional)
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking soda|baking soda]] (optional)
*pinch of salt and ground black pepper (to taste)

==Procedure==

#Peel the potatoes and chop them into roughly 4cm (1 and 1/2 inch) chunks.  Peel and slice the carrots.  Roughly chop both the peppers and the remaining vegetables.   
#On a low heat, melt the margarine or heat the olive oil in a large saucepan.  
#Add all the chopped vegetables and stir, making sure all vegetables get a good coating of the oil.  
#Gently fry/sweat the vegetables for 3 minutes and season well, then add the flour and continue to stir and coat all the vegetables. 
#Add the tin of chopped tomatoes, stir in tomato puree and then add enough water to cover all the ingredients in the pan. 
#Simmer gently for a further 3 minutes, occasionally stirring.
#Add the stock/bouillon and the yeast extract.
#Crush the clove of garlic and gently stir in.  
#Place a lid on (with a slight gap to allow some of the steam to escape) and gently simmer on a low heat for 35-50 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent the ingredients from sticking to the bottom of the pan and burning.
#Now make the dumpling mixture.  Begin by sifting the self- raising flour, baking powder and bicarbonate of soda (for extra fluffy and light dumplings) into a large bowl.  
#Chop the margarine into the flour, and add a pinch of salt and fresh ground pepper
#Add a very small quantity of cold water and pinch-mix with your fingers (you can always add more later), just enough to make a strong, sticky dough.

#Test the main stew to see if it's ready for adding the dumpling dough. Take a carrot from the pan and if it feels semi-cooked, but still firm, then it is the perfect time to add the butter beans, peas and dumplings.  
#Taste and add more seasoning if necessary.  
#Distribute walnut-sized lumps of dough, evenly spaced, on top of the simmering stew. 
#Replace the lid and cook for a further 20-25 minutes, at which time you should have large, light and fluffy dumplings.

Serve the stew and dumplings piping hot straight from the pan with fresh crusty bread and yellow mustard on the side.

* 2 level teaspoon ground [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]s
* 4 [[Cookbook:Fluid Ounce|fluid oz]]. [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]

#Heat gently until butter melts.
#Place dry ingredients in bowl.
#Pour melted butter mixture into bowl, beating thoroughly.
#Warm milk in pan to dissolve syrup.

==Notes, tips, and variations==

*Variant: Parkin
**Instead of 8 oz flour, use 4 oz flour and 4 oz [[Cookbook:Oatmeal|medium oatmeal]] (likely meaning coarse oat flour, not rolled oats).
**Parkin is traditionally eaten in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|England]] around Bonfire Night.

[[Image:Spätzlepresse2.jpg|right|thumb|Spaetzle-press in action]]

'''Spaetzle''' (german: ''Spätzle'') means literally translated &quot;little sparrow&quot; and is a Swabian speciality (Germany). It is made from flour, eggs, water, and salt. There are different techniques to makes spaetzles, i.e. using a spaetzle-maker or spaetzle-press (for the more lazy house person). The original technique is to use a kitchen board and a grater.

Spaetzle are served as side dishes with a [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce]] to [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]] or as main menu with [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]] and [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]].

This recipe is for a cheese spaetzle.

==Ingredients==
* 500 [[Cookbook:Gram|g]] [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 5 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* 150-200 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]] water
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

==Procedure==
# All ingredients are mixed using hands or an electrical mixer. 
# Add enough water to make the dough slightly sticky, yet keeping it elastic and stiff. 
# A large pot with salted water is boiled. 
# If using only a board a spoon of dough is swept over the kitchen board with the grater and then small pieces of the dough is cut/grated with the grater into the hot water. If using a spaetzle-maker, a spoon of the dough is put into the maker and pressed through the holes into the water. 
# The spaetzle are done when they rise and swim on the water surface. 
# The spaetzles can be removed from the water with a slotted spoon and put into a bowl. 
# A thin layer of shredded cheese is put over the noodles. 
# The procedures is repeated until no dough is left. 
# Onions are cut, [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sautéed]] with [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], and put over the spaetzles.

The '''chapati''' is the staple flat bread of Northern [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Pakistan|Pakistan]], also known as a '''roti'''. It can be made from many types of grain, but is most commonly made with finely ground [[Cookbook:Whole Wheat|whole wheat flour]]. Sometimes it is cooked in a little oil.

==Ingredients==
* 3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Whole Wheat|whole wheat flour]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste, about 1 teaspoon
* water as required (about 1 1/2 cups)

==Procedure==
# Knead flour and water, starting with only a slight dribble of water and adding more as you go until the dough becomes smooth but not too sticky.
# Cover for at least 5 minutes.
# Divide into balls and roll out into disks, slightly thicker than denim material; sprinkle with flour as you roll.
#Place a non-oiled pan on a moderately high fire and test its surface temperature by holding your hand over it.
# When very hot, put a chapati on the pan and press it flat with a spatula or dry cloth to make it rise up.
# Flip and repeat so it becomes browned on both sides. 

Makes 8 chapatis.
==Notes==
Regional variations abound in the detail of preparing and cooking roti. In most Indian cooking, for example, the roti is finished by toasting it in the open flame of the cooker. The aim of this process is to encourage the roti to puff up. The hot air which builds inside because the water inside the roti begins to turn into steam and cooks the roti inside out. This may also be achieved under a grill, or by using a microwave (try 30 seconds on high power). Universally, however, the aim in rolling is to get the roti to a perfectly round shape (for aesthetics) and to create uniform thickness, which is vital for successful cooking.

It should also be noted that there are Caribbean specific variation of Roti one of which uses boiled, then ground Yellow Split Peas in its preparation

'''Tadka dhal''' is an everyday staple across South [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]].

==Ingredients==
=== Dhal ===
* 1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Moong dhal|moong dhal]], washed
* 2 cups water
=== Seasoning===
* 2-3 tablespoon cooking oil
* 3-4 tablespoon finely diced [[Cookbook:onion|onion]]
* 2 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], chopped
* a small sliver of [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]], chopped, or 1/4 teaspoon ginger paste
* 4-5 [[Cookbook:Curry leaf|curry leaves]]
* 1/4 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Mustard seed|mustard seed]]
* 1/4 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]] seed
* 1/4 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Fenugreek|fenugreek]] seed
* 1/4 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Asafoetida|asafoetida]] (optional)
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], chopped into 1/8ths
* 1-2 green [[Cookbook:Chilli pepper|chillies]], slit lengthwise
* 1/4 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]] powder
* 1/4 teaspoon red chilli (hot pepper) powder
* pinch of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]/ as per taste

==Procedure==
# Set the dhal and water in an open pot on moderate heat until quite mushy, adding water if it becomes dry and stirring occasionally. This may take 30 minutes to an hour. A pressure cooker may be used to speed up this part of the process.
# Heat the oil in a pan.
# Add mustard seed, standing well back (they tend to crackle).
# Add cumin seed, fenugreek, curry leaves, green chillies and onions
# Wait for the onions to turn translucent. Add garlic and ginger, turn the heat low until the garlic changes to a darker shade. Avoid caramelizing the garlic. Add turmeric, red chilli and asafoetida powder.
# Throw in tomatoes, wait for 2-3 minutes, letting the tomatoes fry in the hot oil. This lets the tomatoes pick the flavors from the spices and also lets the oil-spice (tadka) mixture cool down, stopping the hot frying process that has chilli powder in it. Pour in the mushy dhal, add salt to taste. 
# Simmer until the tomatoes become soft (5-10 minutes), stirring occasionally. Serve with [[Cookbook:Rice Recipes|rice]] or [[Cookbook:Chapati|chapatis]].

Serves 2.

'''Masala chai''' is a spiced version of the typical [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] [[Cookbook:Tea|tea]]. As with much of Indian cuisine, the exact mix of dry [[Cookbook:Spices|spices]] varies greatly and is often handed down in families from one generation to the next. 

==Masala mixture==
===Ingredients===
* 100 [[Cookbook:g|grams]] powdered [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
* 25 grams [[Cookbook:Clove|cloves]]
* 100 grams whole black [[Cookbook:Pepper|peppercorns]]
* 60 grams [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]], broken small, or 40 grams ground
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]], crushed
* 35 grams green [[Cookbook:Cardamom|cardamom]] pods

===Procedure===
Combine all of the spices and blend well in an electric grinder. You only need a small quantity for each cup of chai; store the rest for later. A full recipe will keep you stocked full of chai for months.

==Chai==
===Ingredients (per cup)===
* 1/2 cup water
* 1 1/2 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 3/4 teaspoon dried [[Cookbook:Tea|tea]] leaves - to be traditional, a strong Indian tea such as an Assam is best.
* pinch of masala mixture
* 1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]

===Procedure===
# Boil water and milk.
# Add sugar, tea leaves and masala until the mixture becomes dark (about 5-10 minutes).
# The longer you boil, the stronger the chai.
# Strain into teacups to serve.

===Optional===
* Let the remaining solids cool and sprinkle them on your plants for an excellent fertiliser.
* Tea masala or garam masala from a store can be used to get around the masala mixture process, however pre ground spices lose their flavor over time.
* In step one, boil the water and milk separately, and in step two add the tea leaves and masala to the boiling water, boiling until the tea is as strong as you like.  Only then add the milk to the mix.  This can speed up the process without effecting the flavor.  This method is often used by restaurants to serve chai in large quantities quickly as orders are taken.
* Optionally turn off the heat in the end, cover and let sit for about five minutes for a richer flavor.
* Try adjusting the ratio of milk to water.  For a richer milky tea, try two parts milk to one part water.
* Leave out the sugar for a more adult flavor.  Sugar can be added while drinking if so desired.
* Try other combinations of South Asian spices.  Each region in which chai is commonly available has its own popular or traditional spice mix.  One common addition is cumin seed, though some may not like the strong distinct fragrance.

'''Baingan bartha''' is an [[Cookbook:Eggplant|eggplant (aubergine)]] dish much loved all over [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]]. This southern version of the dish is much different from northern varieties, and well suited to the cuisine of the region.

==Ingredients==
* single (1 pound) [[Cookbook:Eggplant|eggplant (aubergine)]]
* 2-6 green [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chillies]], as desired
* 1 cup fresh ground [[Cookbook:Coconut|coconut]]
* 1 cup chopped fresh [[Cookbook:Cilantro|coriander]] (cilantro)
* 2 cups [[Cookbook:Curd|curd]] (or [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yoghurt]])
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste

==Procedure==
# Roast the eggplant directly over a low flame - don't be afraid to set it right on the gas burner - turning it regularly until the skin becomes blackened and brittle and the flesh soft (about 15-20 minutes).
# Set aside to cool.
# Grind the chillies, coconut and coriander together in a food processor to form a paste.
# Peel the eggplant skin off and mash the flesh to a uniform pulp by hand.
# Mix in the coconut paste and then curds, along with salt to taste.

Serve with [[Cookbook:Chapati|chapatis]], [[Cookbook:Dosa|dosa]] or [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]].

==Warnings==

Baingan bartha is commonly produced with:

* [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]] (seeds)
* [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]] (leaves, from the same plant, and thus sometimes confusingly called coriander as well)
* both coriander and cilantro

The &quot;1 cup chopped&quot; in this recipe is suggestive of cilantro, but this is not at all certain.

'''Upeseru''' is a rural speciality of the South of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]], and villages around the state of Karnataka in particular. The main recipe is for a solid dish of lentils and greens, and the water drained from this is often used in an accompanying wet sauce to be eaten with [[Cookbook:Mudde|mudde]] (ragi balls). The combination of the three is a common complete meal.

==Ingredients==
===Solids===
* 1 1/2 cups [[Cookbook:Dal|dhal]] or other lentils, cooked but not drained
* 5 handfuls of a leafy green such as [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]], chopped
* 2 teaspoons oil
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Mustard seed|mustard seed]]
* 10 [[Cookbook:Curry Leaf|curry leaves]]
* 1 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], diced
* 1-6 green [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chillies]], split lengthwise, according to taste
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste

===Broth===
* 1-6 green [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chillies]], to taste
* 1/2 teaspoon fresh [[Cookbook:Tamarind|tamarind]] per chilli used
* handful of [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]]
* 8 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* 2 teaspoons whole black [[Cookbook:Pepper|peppercorn]]
* 2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]]
* spinach-lentil water
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]

==Procedure==
=== Solids ===
# Fry the mustard seed, curry leaves, onion and green chillies in oil until the onions are partly browned.
# Meanwhile, set the lentils on the stove. Throw in the chopped spinach and bring to boil until the spinach is tender.
# Drain and set the water aside separately for the next recipe.
# Stir in the spice mixture and salt to taste, keeping on the flame until the flavours have blended.

===Broth===
# Dry-roast the chillies and tamarind slightly, if desired.
# Grind all dry ingredients together with a little water to make [[Cookbook:chutney|chutney]].
# Bring the spinach broth to a boil and let simmer for two minutes.
# When serving, mix in a spoonful of the chutney and squeeze in [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]].

==Serving==
Serves 4-6. Eat with [[Cookbook:Mudde|mudde]] (ragi balls).

[[Image:Ragi mudde2.jpg|frame|Ragi Mudde]]
'''Mudde''' is a compact ball of dough made from finger millet. It is a lunchtime staple of rural communities in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh in South [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]], and an important source of long-lasting energy among the rural poor.

==Ingredients==
* 2 1/2 cups [[Cookbook:Ragi|ragi]] (finger millet) flour
* 5 cups water
* [[Ghee]]

==Procedure==
# Boil the water and add a little of the flour to make a paste, then add the rest of the flour.
# Stir once with the handle of a wooden spoon and leave it in the pot.
# Keep on a low fire for about 10 minutes until it smells cooked.
# Stir until the mixture turns dark reddish-brown. Once it begins to leave the sides of the pot, remove the pot from the fire and stir vigorously for 5-10 minutes--it's hard work, but the longer you keep at it, the lighter it will be.
# Pull the dough out and form into balls of about fist size.

Makes about 6 balls.

Serving immediately is preferable, but the balls can also be packed and eaten cold later. Before eating, if desired, poke a hole in the ball with your finger and pour in a little ghee. Dip pieces of the ragi dough in a watery sauce like [[Cookbook:Upeseru|upeseru]] broth and swallow; do not attempt to chew. Eat along with the solid upeseru for a complete meal that will keep you going all day.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian Cuisine]] | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan Cuisine]]

'''Appam''', a [[Cookbook:Fermentation|fermented]] rice pancake, is a speciality of the South [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] coastal state of Kerala. It is especially popular among the Christian communities of that state. Appam are often served along with a coconut-flavoured [[Cookbook:Keralan vegetable stew|vegetable stew]]. It is also very popular in Sri Lanka, where it is known as &quot;appa&quot; (or &quot;hopper&quot;) and often served with an added egg.

==Ingredients==
* 1½ cups uncooked white [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]]
* 1½ cups fresh grated [[Cookbook:Coconut|coconut]]
* 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], or to taste
* 2 tablespoons white [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]], cooked
* [[Cookbook:Water|water]] for soaking rice, and 2 to 2½ cups for grinding
* optional: ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]] or [[Cookbook:Kefir|kefir]], to start the ferment

==Procedure==
# Soak the raw rice in water overnight.
# Grind the soaked rice until about ¼ ground.
# Add the grated coconut along with a little water and continue grinding.
# Add the sugar, cooked rice and yeast or kefir, and keep grinding until the whole mixture becomes smooth. It should be thinner than pancake batter.
# Transfer it to a wide open container and leave it to rise overnight.
# The next morning, add salt and refrigerate the batter until use.
# To fry the appams, use a [[Cookbook:Tava|tava]] or a small bowl-shaped pan with either a non-stick coating or a little oil or ghee.
# Pour a full serving spoon of batter into the middle of the pan and swirl it around a single time so that a little of the batter sticks to the sides.
# Cover the pan with a hot lid and remove the appam with a spatula after 2-3 minutes, when it becomes slightly browned around the edges. It should be round, with a thick centre and thin, lacy edges.

Makes 12.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* The batter ''should'' ferment overnight without any added starter, but often ''won't''. Yeast (or better still, kefir) can be added to help it ferment.
* The grinding can be done in a [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]]. Make sure that there is enough liquid so that it all swirls around in the blender, mixing properly.

This coconut-flavoured '''vegetable stew''' is a famous dish of the South [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] coastal state of Kerala.

** 1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard seed]]
** 1 [[Cookbook:Shallot|shallot]]

==Procedure==
# Pour ¾ cup of water into the grated coconut. Squeeze out the milk through a tea strainer. Set aside; this is first milk.
# Pour ½ cup of water into the same coconut and squeeze out the second milk. Keep this aside as well.
# In a large pan, heat oil and add the cloves, cinnamon and cardamom.
# Add the chopped onion, ginger, chillies and curry leaves. Fry till the onion is partly brown.
# Add the boiled vegetables and stir for one minute.
# Pour in the second milk and boil for about 5-7 minutes.

This traditional [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] '''tomato gravy''' can be used as a base for all sorts of vegetables, boiled [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]], cubed [[Cookbook:Paneer|paneer]] or [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]]. This is often referred to as a &quot;[[Cookbook:Curry|curry]]&quot;. It is usually eaten with plain white [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] or [[Cookbook:Rice Recipes|rice mixtures]].

==Ingredients==
* 5 [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], chopped large
* 1 [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], diced small
* 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Ghee|ghee]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]] paste
* 5 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], pounded
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|chilli powder]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]] powder
* ¼ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]] powder
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste

==Procedure==
# Fry the onions in hot ghee until they start to brown.
# Add the ginger and garlic and stir, then add the powdered spices. Blend well.
# Throw in the tomatoes and salt to taste.
# Turn the flame down to medium and cover for 10 minutes.
# This will form a spicy gravy to which you can add any mixture of vegetables or chicken. If using cooked vegetables, keep the pot on the flame until they are uniformly heated; for uncooked vegetables, cook as long as necessary. For raw chicken be sure to cook for at least 20 minutes.

Serves 4.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
* I like to add a little cayenne and cumin, and leave out the chili powder (though &quot;chili powder&quot; in Indian recipes IS cayenne, ie. powdered chilis!)
* I tried using lamb with this gravy, but the flavours conflict.  I would recommend sticking with chicken or vegetables for this recipe.  Also, depending on the freshness of your spices, you may want to add extra spices in the same ratio to achieve a stronger flavour.
* Generally for lamb you can use all the above ingredients except the tomatoes. Marination is preferred. Cloves and cinnamon can be added to give an excellent flavour.

This very fancy '''pulao''', or mixed rice, is from the Northern [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] state of Kashmir.

# Add salt to taste.
# Turn the flame down to low.
# Soak the strands of saffron in milk, mixing until the milk turns orange.
# Pour the cooked rice into the pan and sprinkle the saffron-milk on top.
# Stir very carefully so as not to break or mash up the rice grains, mixing the flavourings and saffron colour in uniformly and heating the rice.
# Add more ghee according to your preference
# optional adding panneer fried in ghee to the pulao makes it taste better. use chicidi as a sidedish

Serve with a gravy such as the [[Cookbook:Basic Indian tomato gravy|basic tomato gravy]]. Serves 4.

'''Modak''' is a deep fried [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] sweet that is almost exclusively prepared during the [[w:Ganesha#Festivals_and_Worship_of_Ganesh|Ganesha Festival]] around August, when it is often given as an offering to Lord [[w:Ganesh|Ganesha]], the elephant-headed Remover of Obstacles. Modak is reportedly his favorite sweet.

==Ingredients==
* Dough:
** 1 cup white wheat flour
** 1 cup [[Cookbook:Semolina|semolina]] flour
** pinch of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
** pinch of [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]] powder
** 1 cup warm water
** oil for frying

* Filling:
** 1 [[Cookbook:Coconut|coconut]], grated finely (makes about two cups)
** 1 1/2 cups [[Cookbook:Jaggery|jaggery]] (or substitute raw [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]])
** 3/4 tablespoon powdered [[Cookbook:Cardamom|cardamom]]
In some parts of the country (coastal Maharashtra), modak is prepared using rice flour, as rice is the main crop of that region. There are slight changes in the preparation method as given below.

==Procedure==
# Prepare the dough; it should be dry but stay a little sticky.
# Sprinkle it with oil and leave it covered for 1 hour.
# Melt the jaggery with 4 tablespoons of water in a non-stick pan until it is liquid.
# Add the coconut.
# [[Cookbook:Sautéing|Sauté]] for 15-20 minutes, until the mixture becomes very thick and almost dry.
# Mix in the cardamom powder and remove from the fire.
# Spread the mixture out on a metal tray to cool.
# Take a tablespoon-sized ball of dough and roll it out - using flour if it is sticky - into a disc 4 inches across.
# Put a tablespoon-sized lump of filling in the middle (it should be hardening well by now), wet the edges with a finger, and fold up the sides, crimping the dough into a peak at the top to completely seal in the filling.
# [[Cookbook:Deep fry|Deep fry]] the modak in oil until golden brown.

Makes 20-25.

=== Procedure for rice modak ===

For making '''rice flour modak''', the procedure is the same for making the filling of coconut and jaggery. However, rice flour is used in the dough instead of wheat flour. They are not fried, but steamed.

The recipie

Ingrediants

2 cups rice flour

2 1/2 cups water

1 tbsp butter

salt


For the filling

1 cup fresh grated coconut

1 cup jaggery

2 tbsp raisins

2 tbsp cashewnuts, chopped

1 tsp cardamom, powdered

Ghee


Method

For the filling

Method is similar to the one mentioned in the fried modak recipie.

For the steamed rice modak

Heat 2 cups of water in a large pot/vessel and then add salt and butter.

As the water starts boiling, add rice flour to the water. Lower heat. Mix well. The mixture should be a smooth paste; there should be no lumps. If mixture is becoming too dry then add the remaining 1/2 cup water. Keep heating on slow fire till rice flour is cooked.

Now, cover the mixture with a lid and switch of the gas.
Let it cook in its own steam.

While it is still warm rub some ghee on your palms and take a small portion . Make a ball out 
of it. With your thumb shape the ball into a cup. Put two teaspoons of the filling and close the ends in a manner to get the shape of a fresh fig. 

Make 10 modaks and place them in a colander grased with ghee. place the modak in such a way that they do not touch one  another in the colander.

Place the colander in a steamer and steam the modaks for 10 minutes. 

Dribble with a teaspoon of ghee and server hot.

==Ingredients==
*1 C      warm water (105-115 degrees F)
*2 T      (or 2 packages) of active dry [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]]
*1 pinch  [[Cookbook:Sugar|unrefined sugar]]
*1 C      [[Cookbook:Soy milk|soy milk]]
*1/3 C    (packed) unrefined sugar
*3 T      vegan butter or [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
*1 T      [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1 1/2 C  walnuts (optional)
*1/4 C    soft tofu (mashed), stir until chunks are minimal (egg replacer or 1 T ground flax seed also works)
*2 1/2 C  cups fine-milled or medium-milled whole wheat [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*3 7/8 C  unbleached all-purpose white flour

==Procedure==
#In a small bowl stir up the yeast in 1/2 cup warm water, add a pinch of unrefined sugar. Let the yeast activate for 10 minutes.
#To a large mixing bowl add the other 1/2 cup water, milk, unrefined sugar, melted vegan margarine, salt, tofu, and whole wheat flour. Stir with wooden spoon until creamy.
#Add the yeast mixture which should be foamy by now. Add walnuts. Add in the unbleached wheat flour a little at a time. Stir until the dough is to thick for the spoon then put the dough on a lightly fluored cutting board or counter top and mix by hand. When all the flour is added, knead dough for around 5-7 minutes. Cover dough with a towel and let rise for around 1 to 1.5 hours. Dough should double in size.
#Knock the dough down once then place 2 equal portions of the dough into 2 greased pans. If you want the loaves to look fancy do this: roll dough into 4 separate dough &quot;snakes&quot;. Twist 2 of these together to make a nice looking intertwined loaf. Let rise about 45 minutes.
#Brush tops of loaves with melted margarine (keeps them from drying out) and dust with [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]], uncooked oatmeal or white flour (aesthetics). Bake in oven preheated to 375F for around 35 minutes. When done, loaves will sound hollow when tapped.

Minestra loses its flavour if it is boiled too long.  In Lombardy,
however, rice, macaroni, &amp;c., are rarely boiled enough for English
tastes.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian Cuisine]]

A '''dosa''' is a thin, spicy, crispy crêpe-like food made from fermented rice, very popular in restaurants in South [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]]. It may be served plain with [[Cookbook:Sambar|sambar]] and chutneys such as  [[Cookbook:Coconut Chutney|coconut chutney]] (as pictured), or other curry or gravy. When served with [[Cookbook:Aloo masala|alu masala]] folded inside, it is known as '''masala dosa'''. To make omelette dosa, simply pour beaten egg on the dosa before it is turned over.

The procedure for making dosa starts out almost identical to that for making [[Cookbook:Idli|idli]]. The idli recipe in this cookbook has some very good [[Cookbook:Idli#Notes, tips, and variations|tips and variations]] that apply equally to dosai.

== First Variation ==
===Ingredients=== 
* 3 cups white [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Urad Dal|urad dal]] (black gram)
* handful of cooked rice (if required)
* pinch of [[Cookbook:sugar|sugar]] (if desired)
* ¼ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

===Procedure===
====Batter====
# Put the rice and dal in a large pot and wash twice.
# Fill with water until submerged by 2 inches.
# Soak for 6 hours.
# [[Cookbook:Purée|Grind]] in an [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]], water and all, for 30 minutes. If the weather is cold, grind in a handful of rice and a pinch of sugar to help in fermentation.
# Let ferment overnight in a warm place. Make sure the pot is twice as large as the amount of batter, as it will rise a great deal.
# Add salt; at this point the batter can be kept in the refrigerator for more than a week until you wish to fry the dosas.
====Dosas====
# Heat a [[Cookbook:Tava|tava]] (large flat pan) or [[Cookbook:griddle|griddle]] over a high flame.
# Sprinkle water on the pan to cool it a little.
# Pour ½&amp;ndash;¾ cup batter in the middle of the pan, depending on preferred thickness and crispiness.
# Spread the batter with the back of a spoon, starting from the centre and spiralling outwards until the dosa is about 10 inches across and very thin.
# Sprinkle a little [[Cookbook:oil|oil]] around the edges of the dosa.
# Cover until the dosa shows brown through the thinnest parts.
# Turn the dosa around on its back and allow it to cook for a few seconds.
# Fold in half and remove with a metal spatula.

Makes 10&amp;ndash;15.

== Second Variation ==

=== Preparation ===
Makes about 20
*2 cups (360 g) rice, preferably parboiled
*1/2 cup (90 g) split and husked [[Cookbook:Urad Dal|urad dal]] ('dhuli urad')
*1/2 tsp [[Cookbook:Fenugreek|fenugreek seeds]] (methi dana)
*2 tsp salt
*Oil for cooking doshas

'''Method '''

# Soak rice, dal, and fenugreek seeds together overnight.
# Grind these ingredients together to a very smooth consistency. 
# Add the salt and enough water to make into a dropping consistency, and leave to rise for 5-6 hours, or overnight. 
# Check consistency of the batter, and if needed, add enough water to make into a smooth pouring consistency.
# Heat [[Cookbook:Tava|tava]] (dosa pan) very hot, splash a little water over it, and with a ladle, immediately pour some batter onto it, spreading it thin, with a circular motion, without pressing too hard. (You will need some practice to get it right).
# Lower the heat and dribble a little oil around the edges. When edges start browning a bit, it is  almost done.
# Turn the dosa around on its back and allow it to cook for a few seconds.
# Add desired filling and fold over.

== Masala Dosa (Mysore style) ==

=== Ingredients for preparation ===
====Batter====
*Ponni or Sona Masuri [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]]: 1 Cup
*Boiled Rice: 1 Cup
*[[Cookbook:Urad Dal|Urad dal]] (whole skinless black gram): ¾ Cup
*Non iodized [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]: To Taste

====Filling====
*[[Cookbook:Potato|Potatoes]]: 6 Medium Sized, [[Cookbook:Boil|Boiled]] and coarsely mashed
*[[Cookbook:Onion|Onions]]: 2 Medium Sized, Finely chopped
*[[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|Green Chili Pepper]]: 3 to 6, Finely Chopped
*[[Cookbook:Ginger|Ginger]]: 1 Tsp, finely grated
*[[Cookbook:Garlic|Garlic]]: 1 Tsp, finely grated
*[[Cookbook:Cooking oil|Oil]]: 2 Tbsp
*[[Cookbook:Mustard|Mustard Seeds]]: ½ Tsp
*[[Cookbook:Cilantro|Cilantro]]: 1 TBS, finely chopped
*[[Cookbook:Channa dhal|Chana Dal]]: 1 Tsp
*[[Cookbook:Turmeric|Turmeric]]: 1 Tsp
*[[Cookbook:Curry Leaf|Curry Leaves]]: 1 Tsp, coarsely chopped
*[[Cookbook:Onion Chutney|Onion Chutney]]
*[[Cookbook:Coconut Chutney|Coconut Chutney]]

====For Assembly====
*Mixture of [[Cookbook:Ghee|Ghee]] and vegetable shortening: ½ cup

=== Preparation Method ===
====Batter====
On the day before, grind all the ingredients in a [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]] or specialized dosa grinder with water. The final consistency of the batter must be similar to [[Cookbook:Pancake|pancake]] batter. Leave it overnight in a warm spot and allow it to [[Cookbook:Fermentation|ferment]]. This is a very important process and must not be skipped. During fermentation the batter may rise to almost twice its volume and therefore the container for the batter must allow for this.

====Chutneys====
Prepare the two chutneys as described in [[Cookbook:Onion Chutney|Onion Chutney]] and [[Cookbook:Coconut Chutney|Coconut Chutney]]

====Filling====
In a [[Cookbook:Wok|wok]] or other deep vessel heat the oil. When the oil is hot add the mustard seeds and allow it to splutter. When spluttering starts to recede add the chopped green chilies, curry leaves and the channa dal. Stir until the channa dal turns brown. (Be careful as channa dal can go from browned to burnt within seconds). Add the onions and fry until browned and add turmeric and stir for 2 minutes. Add ginger and garlic and stir it in for a few seconds. Add the boiled and coarsely mashed potatoes into the mix and fold well. Turn off the heat and add lemon juice and the coriander leaves. Fold well.

=== Making a Dosa ===
Dosai can easily be made on a [[Cookbook:Tava|tava]], iron [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]] or non-stick pan. Heat the pan on a medium heat until a drop of water evaporates on contact.
Spread about 1/2 cup of batter on the pan (like pancakes) slowing spreading it outwards forming a thin, flat circular dosa. Allow it cook for a minute and using a flat, sharp [[Cookbook:Spatula|spatula]] flip it over. As the other side cooks spread a layer of ghee-shortening mixture on the topside. Flip it over again. As the bottom crisps add a Tsp of the onion chutney on the top and spread it evenly. Add some of the filling onto one half of the dosa and fold the other side over. Serve with coconut chutney.

'''Potato masala''' or uralai kehazhangu masala is a potato mixture that is often served alongside, or folded inside, a [[Cookbook:Dosa|dosa]]. This combination, widely eaten in South [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]], is known as '''masala dosa'''. [[Cookbook:Coconut Chutney|Coconut chutney]] is a common accompaniment.

==Ingredients==
* 4 large [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], cubed and par-boiled
* 1 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], chopped thin
* 4-5 split green [[Cookbook:Chilli pepper|chillies]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* ½ tablespoon [[Cookbook:Channa dhal|chana dhal]] (optional)
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Mustard seed|mustard seed]]
* 5 [[Cookbook:Curry leaf|curry leaves]]
* pinch of [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]] powder
* 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:oil|oil]]

==Procedure==
# Heat oil.
# [[Cookbook:Sautéing|Sautée]] the mustard seed first, then add chana dhal, curry leaves, onion and chillies. 
# Fry until the onions begin to change color.
# Add potatoes.
# Sprinkle the turmeric evenly and stir well to mix all the ingredients
# Cover and cook on a medium flame for about 5 minutes, stirring well, until the potatoes become very soft and somewhat mashed.

'''Garlic croutons''' can be purchased but are much better when made from old bread. They are a crucial ingredient of [[Cookbook:Caesar_Salad|Caesar Salad]].

==Ingredients==
*4 slices day-old French bread, cubed
*2 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], minced
*4 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Olive_oil|olive oil]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] to taste

Makes enough croutons for 4 servings of salad.

==Procedure==
# Pour the olive oil into a shallow bowl over the garlic and let it soak. Soaking it longer will yield more garlic flavor
# Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (~180 degrees Celsius).
# Strain the olive oil into a pan and fry the bread cubes in it, tossing to coat with oil.
# Spread the bread cubes on a baking sheet and garnish with salt. Bake for 10 minutes or until crispy and dry.

==Variants==

To make non-garlic croutons, simply omit the garlic.

One may omit the prep work of mincing the garlic by adding the whole cloves of garlic to the oil and then crushing the garlic (either with a mortar or a fork).

By using very small bread cubes, frying crisp, and omitting the baking, these croutons may be used in place of potatoes.

== Introduction ==
There are many types of bread.  Each type of bread has its own history, style, and of course taste.  The more you experiment with different types of bread, the better you will be at creating new and interesting recipes.

The basic elements of bread are [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] (ground grain) and water. [[Cookbook:Wheat|Wheat]] flour is the most popular, having many qualities that contribute to good bread. Other flours that are used include [[Cookbook:Rye|rye]], [[Cookbook:Corn|corn]], and [[Cookbook:Barley|barley]].

Bread is generally assumed to be made with [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]]. Sometimes the term &quot;bread&quot; is meant to include quickbreads (raised with something other than yeast, commonly [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]) and flatbreads (not raised at all).

==[[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian]] breads==
=== How to prepare Italian bread dough ===
Please note that where I work, the dough comes in already mixed and stretched, we just have to prepare it.  But, here is how to obtain the proper length and thickness.
&lt;!-- WE NEED A LOCAL RECIPE If you don't have already made dough, there is a recipe at http://www.lisashea.com/lisabase/bread/italian.html which you can use. --&gt;
Roll your dough into a &quot;stick&quot; approximately [[Cookbook:Inch|14 to 16 inches]] long, and about 2/3 the thickness of a Pringles can. Optionally, you can cut the top in three diagonal hash marks, approx. [[Cookbook:Inch|1/8&quot;]] deep.

=== How to prepare Mini Italian bread dough ===
Prepare one Italian bread but do not put the hash marks on top.
Cut the dough in half widthwise so that you have two pieces half the length of the original dough.
Optionally, you can cut two diagonal hash marks, approx. 1/8&quot; deep.

==[[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|French]] Breads==
=== How to prepare French bread dough ===
Prepare one Italian bread but do not put the hash marks on top.
Stretch the dough until it is approx. twice its length.  Optionally, you can cut four diagonal hash marks, approx. 1/8&quot; deep.

=== How to prepare French Sticks bread dough ===
Prepare one Italian bread but do not put the hash marks on top.
Cut the dough in half lengthwise so that you have two pieces the same length of the original dough.
Optionally, you can cut three diagonal has marks, approx. 1/8&quot; deep.

==Other types of breads==
=== How to prepare Sub Bun bread dough ===
Prepare one Italian bread but do not put the hash marks on top.
Cut the dough in half lengthwise, and once again widthwise, so that you have four pieces half the length of the original dough.  Optionally, you can cut two diagonal hash marks, approx. 1/8&quot; deep.

*[[Cookbook:Beer_Bread|Beer Bread]]

==Flourishes==
=== Adding [[Cookbook:Sesame Seed|sesame seeds]] or [[Cookbook:Poppy Seed|poppy seeds]] to your bread ===
Paint the top of the bread with an [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] white, then lightly sprinkle the desired seeds onto the top.

==[[Cookbook:Baking|Baking]] methods==
=== Baking with a Proofer system ===
Place prepared product onto a metal tray/[[Cookbook:Cookie Sheet|cookie sheet]] lined with [[Cookbook:Parchment Paper|parchment paper]]. Make sure you leave room for your product to grow to twice its size.
Place tray in proofer for one hour.  Check with your fingertips if the dough is still sticky.  If so, leave in the proofer and check every 5 minutes.  Once the dough no longer sticks to your finger tips, you can remove it from the proofer and place it in the [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]].  Bake it at [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|400 degrees]] until golden brown.

=== Baking without a Proofer system ===
Lightly dust a baking tray with a small amount of flour, place the bread dough onto the tray ensuring enough room for the bread to gain in size, Cover the bread dough with a dry, clean [[Cookbook:Tea|tea]] towel. Place the bread into a moderatly warm environment and allow to rise, the time to rise will depend on the bread recipe.

A good environment for bread rising is above a large oven, turn the oven onto the lowest setting or [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|gas mark 1]]. You can also just put it in an oven and turn on the oven light.  This, too, will provide enough warmth to help the bread rise.  Also try a laundry room or furnace room.

'''Orange Hot Chocolate''' is a twist on the old childhood favorite.  Note that this hot chocolate is not sweet.  Those who like it sweeter should use a chocolate with a higher sugar content, or add 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] with the chocolate.

==Ingredients==
*4 cups [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*1 stick [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*4 oz. [[Cookbook:Chocolate|bittersweet chocolate]], chopped (can substitute semisweet)
*&amp;frac12; tsp. [[Cookbook:Orange extract|orange extract]]
*&amp;frac14; tsp. [[Cookbook:Vanilla extract|vanilla extract]]

Serves 4.

==Procedure==
# Place the milk and cinnamon in a [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]], and gently heat to just below a simmer, about 180 °F.
# Add the chocolate, and stir while allowing to melt.  Do not allow to come to a boil.
# When the chocolate has melted, strain the chocolate milk into another container, add the extracts, and whisk or blend until frothy.  Transfer to mugs or heatproof glasses and serve.

A '''chocolate pear bake''' is a dessert that resembles a brownie in appearance, yet contains no flour, instead using whipped egg whites to provide structure.  The pear adds a nice mild fruit tone to the chocolate.

==Ingredients==
*7 oz (200g) [[Cookbook:Chocolate|semisweet chocolate]], chopped or chips
*½ cup (120g) [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
*4 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]s, separated
*½ cup (120g) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Pear|pear]]s, sliced
*lightly [[Cookbook:Whipped cream|whipped cream]], to serve

==Procedure==
#Grease a 9x9 inch (22cm x 22cm) [[Cookbook:Baking Dish|baking dish]], and pre-heat the oven to [[Cookbook:oven temperature|325°F]] (170°C).
#In a [[Cookbook:Double Boiler|double boiler]], [[Cookbook:Melting|melt]] the chocolate and butter or margarine. When melted, remove from the heat.
#[[Cookbook:Whisk|Whisk]] the [[Cookbook:egg yolk|egg yolk]]s and sugar together until they become thick and pale yellow.
#In a separate bowl, whisk the [[Cookbook:Egg White|egg white]]s until firm.
#Combine the chocolate and egg yolk mixture, and mix well.
#Beginning with about ⅓ the egg whites, gently [[Cookbook:Folding|fold]] them into the chocolate/egg yolk mixture.
#Add the slices of pear, and stir once or twice. Add the entire mixture to the baking dish.
#[[Cookbook:Baking|Bake]] for 35-40 minutes, until the bake is springy yet firm to the touch.
#Serve hot with whipped cream.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Substitute sliced peaches, apples, or orange segments for the pears.

==Warnings==
*Overmixing after the egg whites have been added to the batter can result in the bake being too dense.

'''Lasagne''' is a baked pasta dish.

==Ingredients==
* 1 lb. sweet Italian sausage 
* 1/2 lb. minced (ground) [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], chopped fine
* 2 cloves garlic, crushed 
* 3 1/2 tablespoons sugar
* 1 tablespoon salt
* 1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil
* 1/2 teaspoon fennel seed
* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
* 1/4 cup chopped [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]] (divided)
* 4 cups canned whole tomatoes, undrained, halved, seeds removed
* 12 oz tomato paste
* 1/2 cup water
* 1/2 tablespoon salt
* 2 cups [[Cookbook:Ricotta cheese|ricotta cheese]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
* 16 oz. package lasagna
* 16 oz. package of [[Cookbook:Mozzarella cheese|mozzarella cheese]], thinly sliced (a wire cutter is nice for semi-soft cheeses like this)
* about 3 Tbsp. grated [[Cookbook:Parmesan cheese|Parmesan cheese]]

==Procedure==
#Remove sausage casings, and break sausage into small bits. 
#Sauté sausage and ground beef in 5-quart saucepan or Dutch oven over medium heat with onion and garlic until the meat is browned.
#Add sugar, 1 tablespoon salt, basil, fennel, pepper, and half the parsley; mix well.
#Add tomatoes, tomato paste and water, mashing the tomatoes a bit. Bring the sauce to a boil then reduce heat and simmer, covered and stirring occasionally for 1 1/2 hours.
#Preheat oven to 275 degrees F.
#Cook and drain pasta.
#In a medium bowl mix ricotta, egg, 1/2 teaspoon salt and remaining parsley.
#Assemble your lasagna in a 13&quot; x 9&quot; x 2&quot; roasting pan (listed bottom to top):
#*bottom layer of sauce (approx. 1 1/2 cups)
#*layer of pasta (overlapping slightly)
#*layer of 1/2 the ricotta mixture
#*layer of 1/3 of the mozzarella
#*sauce layer (again, about 1 1/2 cups)
#*layer of grated Parmesan sprinkled over sauce (not so much that the sauce layer is covered entirely)
#*layer of pasta
#*layer of remaining ricotta
#*layer of 1/3 of the mozzarella
#*layer of remaining sauce
#*layer of sprinkled Parmesan
#*layer of remaining mozzarella
#Cover the lasagna with foil and roast 30 minutes covered, then 25 minutes uncovered (or until bubbly and lightly browned). Cool for at least 20 minutes before serving.

Uncooked lasagnas freeze very well so the extra work can be done well in advance. You can make several batches at a time and freeze the extras to thaw out and cook later.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Vegetarian cuisine|Vegetarian]] | [[Cookbook:Breakfast|Breakfast]]

'''French toast''' (or &quot;poor knights&quot;) is a common [[Cookbook:Breakfast|breakfast]] item made by [[Cookbook:Frying|frying]] an [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] [[Cookbook:Batter|batter]] soaked piece of [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]. French toast was developed as a way to use day-old stale bread.  Lacking day-old bread, [[Cookbook:Toasting|toasting]] your bread lightly can help it absorb more of the egg and milk batter.
[[Image:frenchtoast.jpg|thumb|300px|right|French toast serving]]
French toast is usually served with toppings similar to those used for [[Cookbook:Pancake|pancakes]], [[Cookbook:Waffle|waffles]], and [[Cookbook:Toast|toast]]. Suggested toppings are:

* real [[Cookbook:Maple Syrup|maple syrup]], table syrup
* [[Cookbook:Jam|jam]], [[Cookbook:Jelly|jelly]], fruit syrup
* [[Cookbook:Whipped Cream|whipped cream]]
* [[Cookbook:Powdered Sugar|powdered sugar]]
* [[Cookbook:Nut|nuts]]
* [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]] (as served in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|China]])
* [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]]
* [[Cookbook:Raspberries|raspberries]] or [[Cookbook:Strawberries|strawberries]] or [[Cookbook:Blueberries|blueberries]] or all 3!

This recipe is easily scalable.  The simplest thing is to memorize the recipe for two slices (1 serving), and then multiply to make more. You can coat 2.25 to 2.5 slices from this, or perhaps less than two if the bread slices are large.

==Ingredients==
* 1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] for every 2 slices of bread 
* approximately 1/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (60ml) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] (more for softer, less egg-like French toast; less for firmer, more egg-like toast)
* 2 slices [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] (I cut 1&quot; thick slices of French bread) 
*[[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] (best), [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]], or [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]

Optional:

*1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] extract or similar extract
*1/4 - 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]], [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]] or other powdered [[Cookbook:Spice|spice]] suitable for sweet items
*1/2 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] 
*1/4 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] 
*1/4 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]

Makes roughly 2 slices of French toast.

==Procedure==
#In a bowl mix eggs and milk, and optional ingredients as desired.  
#Heat up a [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]], [[Cookbook:Skillet|skillet]] or [[Cookbook:Griddle|griddle]] to a medium-low temperature.
#Use butter, margarine, or cooking spray on the pan.
#Soak a slice of bread in the egg-milk mixture and place on pan; repeat until pan is full.
#[[Cookbook:Browning|Brown]] both sides of the French toast.
#Serve on plates, usually two slices per person, with toppings as desired.

==Tips==
The goal is to get both sides of the French toast nicely browned, while making sure the center is cooked. Using excessive heat could scorch the outside of the toast while leaving the inside undercooked.

Also, unless you are making French toast for dozens of people, it is easier to make sure that each slice of bread is evenly soaked in the egg and mix mixture if you make it up in small batches, one egg and 1/4 cup of milk and two slices at a time in one bowl.  Then soak the two slices until almost all of the mixture has been absorbed.  If your bowl is small, place the two slices on top of each other, then keep switching their position and flipping them (so that all four faces will be down into the mixture) until the mixture is absorbed.

The cooking process is too short to use most raw [[Cookbook:Spices|spices]], but some fresh [[Cookbook:Herbs|herbs]] might be very tasty.

'''Mousse au chocolat''' (French for &quot;chocolate foam&quot;) is a sweet food, normally served as dessert.

==Ingredients==

* 200 g (8 oz) [[Cookbook:Bittersweet chocolate|bittersweet chocolate]], chopped (see Note)
* 3 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]s (see Note)
* 250ml (1 cup) [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]]
* 40g [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 30 ml (2 tablespoons) hot water

==Preparation==
# Melt the chocolate in a [[Cookbook:Double Boiler|double boiler]].
# Separate the eggs.
# Whisk the egg whites and cream separately until very firm. Put both in the refrigerator.
# Combine the egg yolks and hot water in a mixing bowl (maximum tap water temperature is enough, approx. 50°-60°C or 120°-140°F).  Using a [[Cookbook:Mixer|mixer]], beat slowly while adding the sugar, then speed up the mixer until the mixture is thick and becomes a light yellow color.
# Stir the melted chocolate into the yolk mixture (the chocolate should have cooled enough that it does not hurt if you insert your finger). Mix immediately, otherwise this will cook the egg yolks, and you'll have chocolate scrambled eggs!
# With the whisk (from now on do not use the mixer) add the egg whites in three parts to the chocolate mixture, followed by the whipped cream.
# The finished mousse should be light brown and very fluffy. While it is still liquid, divide it into individual serving dishes. Allow to chill in the refrigerator for 4-6 hours before serving.  The mousse will be quite firm when ready.

==Notes, tips and variations==

* This recipe is not the &quot;purest&quot; form, which contains only bittersweet chocolate and eggs: 6 eggs for 200 g (8 oz) of chocolate; no cream, no sugar.
* It is one of the easiest recipes for untrained cooks. The only &quot;difficult&quot; parts are separating the eggs and folding the egg whites.
* Use only the best quality chocolate available.  Chocolate from Lindt &amp; Spruengli or their U.S. subsidiary Ghirardelli is highly recommended.
* For the more advanced cook: use a fourth yolk (and ''only'' the yolk!); it ensures that the mousse becomes firm. However, the mixture must be worked faster, beginning with the addition of the chocolate to the yolk/sugar mixture.
* Instead of the water, use an alcoholic spirit such as Cognac, Cointreau, Kahlua, Triple Sec, etc., for all or part of the 30 ml. However, the mousse is then not suitable for children or pregnant women.
* Coffee can also be satisfyingly substituted for the liquid.
* Almond powder, almond butter, or orange rind can also be used to add flavor to the mousse (one tablespoon per 6 eggs)
* There is also an [[Cookbook:Atkins-friendly Chocolate Mousse|Atkins-friendly recipe]].

==Warnings==

* This mousse is best consumed within 24 hours.
* Do not keep substantially longer, even if refrigerated.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|United States]] | [[Cookbook:Breakfast|Breakfast]]

A '''Southwestern Scramble''' is a  scrambled eggs recipe with many spicy ingredients, such as onions and chilis.  For a complete breakfast, serve with sliced, fried [[Cookbook:Wiejska|wiejska]] ([[Cookbook:Cuisine of Poland|Polish]] [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausage]]), [[Cookbook:Toast|toast]], and [[Cookbook:Orange Juice|orange juice]].

==Ingredients==
*8 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]s
*2 tablespoons (30 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*1 medium red [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], chopped
*1 medium green [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili pepper]], such as [[Cookbook:Jalapeño|jalapeño]], seeded and chopped
*1 green [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell pepper]], seeded and sliced
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Black Pepper|black pepper]], to taste
*Serve with [[Cookbook:Hot Sauce|hot sauce]], such as [[Wikipedia:Tabasco sauce|Tabasco sauce]]
*[[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]], or [[Cookbook:Cooking Spray|cooking spray]], for [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]]

==Procedure==
#Chop the onion and chili, and slice the bell pepper.  Crack the eggs into a large mixing bowl, add the milk, and beat until well combined.
#Place a large [[Cookbook:Frying pan|frying pan]] over medium heat, add the butter, margarine, or cooking spray, and allow to melt.  Add the onions, chili, and bell pepper, and sauté for 2-4 minutes.
#Add the eggs to the pan, and allow to cook for 30 seconds to 1 minute, until they just begin to set.  Turn the heat up to high, and begin ''scrambling'' the eggs by scraping the bottom of the pan with a spatula and folding the cooked egg into the egg mixture.
#When the eggs are still moist, but mostly cooked, remove from the fire and plate.  
#Serve while still hot.

==Tips and tricks==
*To adjust the spicyness, use more or fewer chili peppers, or use types varying levels of heat.
*The chilis are seeded because of the intense heat in the seeds, where the majority of the ''[[w:Capsaicin|capsaicin]]'' is.  The seeds can be left in, but the scramble will be much hotter.
*Be sure to scrape the entire bottom of the pan, as well as the sides.  Otherwise, those areas where the egg is not scraped will burn.
*Carryover heat will continue to cook the eggs, so they should be removed from the fire while still slightly underdone, otherwise they will be over cooked.

This is a kind of [[Cookbook:Chili|Chili]] that needs no meat (and uses no ersatz meat).  Many variations are possible; the recipe is very flexible.  The molasses gives this chili a somewhat Louisiana flavor.

==Ingredients==
* 2 cans red [[Cookbook:Kidney Bean|kidney bean]]s
* 1 can [[Cookbook:Black Bean|black bean]]s
* 1 can [[Cookbook:Navy Bean|navy bean]]s
* 1 can [[Cookbook:Corn|corn]] kernels
* 1 can [[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomato paste]]
* 1 medium [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]], chopped (canned diced tomato works too)
* 2 fresh [[Cookbook:Jalapeño|jalapeño]]s (or your favorite [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili pepper]] works too; more if you like it really hot)
* 1 green [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell pepper]], chopped
* 1 red or yellow bell pepper, chopped
* 2 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]s, chopped
* 4 medium cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], chopped or crushed
* 10 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]] [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|chili powder]]
* large pinch [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] (to taste; not needed)
* pinch of [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]]
* 10 mL [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]] (or any other kind of vegetable oil)
* 50 mL [[Cookbook:Molasses|molasses]]
* [[Cookbook:Chili Garlic Sauce|chili garlic sauce]] (optional)

==Procedure==
In a large pot, heat the olive oil with a few drops of water.  When the water starts sizzling, add the onions and garlic.  Stir until the onions are soft (optionally until they are slightly brown).  Add the chili peppers and fry for a few more seconds.  Add the tomato paste and tomato, and the chili powder, salt, and oregano.  Stir a few times then let [[Cookbook:Boiling|boil]] and [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]].  

Wash the slime from the cans off the beans.  Add the beans and corn.  Add the molasses.  Taste the chili; if it needs more seasoning, add it now (perhaps with the exception of salt, as people can add this at the table).  It is probably better not to add more jalapeños at this point, but if the chili is not spicy enough, some chili sauce or chili garlic sauce can be added. Let the pot simmer, covered, for at least 30 minutes - longer will distribute the flavor better.  If the chili is too thick, add a little water; if it's too thin, uncover the pot.

Add the bell peppers, stir, and simmer for a minute or two (peppers should stay crunchy).  Serve with [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]; makes about 8 bowls, which are very filling.  Keeps well, perhaps even better the second day.

''Cook's Note:'' In making this recipe, when I got to the [[Cookbook:Boiling|boil]] part, there was no liquid in the pot to boil.  I added two cups of vegetable broth, which seemed to work well, but next time I'll try a large can of diced tomatoes.

''Cook's Note:'' It's not clear how large each of the cans should be.  Canned tomatoes in particular can come in much larger sizes than canned beans.

'''Chowder''' is any of a variety of soups, most of them thick and made with [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]]es. To some Americans, it means clam chowder, made with [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]] or [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] as [[Cookbook:New England Clam Chowder|New England Clam Chowder]], or with [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]] as [[Cookbook:Manhattan Clam Chowder|Manhattan Clam Chowder]].&quot; [[Cookbook:Corn Chowder|Corn Chowder]] is a thick soup filled with whole corn ([[Cookbook:Maize|maize]]) kernels. Chowder is often commonly associated with the [[Cookbook:New England cuisine|New England]] region of the United States.

The recipe below for &quot;New England chowder&quot; is, oddly, not a clam chowder.

From the 1881 ''Household Cyclopedia''

==New England Chowder==

Have a good haddock, cod, or any other solid fish; cut it in pieces three inches square, put a pound of fat salt pork in strips into the pot, set it on hot coals and fry out the oil; take out the pork and put in a layer of fish, over that a layer of onions in slices, then a layer of fish with slips of fat salt pork, then another layer of onions, and so on alternately until your fish is consumed; mix some flour with as much water as will fill the pot; season with black pepper and salt to your taste, and boil it for half an hour. Have ready some crackers (Philadelphia pilot bread if you can get it) soaked in water till they are a little softened; throw them into your chowder five minutes before you take it up. Serve in a tureen.

This is similar to the traditional Scottish soup [[Cookbook:Cullen skink|cullen skink]].

==Daniel Webster's Chowder==

Four tablespoonfuls of onions, fried with pork; a quart of boiled potatoes well mashed; 1 1/2 pounds of sea biscuit broken; 1 teaspoonful of thyme mixed with one of summer savory: 1/2 bottle of mushroom catsup; one bottle of port or claret; 1/4 of a nutmeg, grated; a few cloves, mace, and allspice; 6 pounds fish (sea-bass or cod), cut into slices; 25 oysters, a little black pepper, and a few slices of lemon. The whole put in a pot and covered with an inch of water, boiled for an hour and gently stirred.

A ''ceviche'' is a raw seafood dish, originating in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Peru|Peru]].  This recipe adds a bit of a [[Cookbook:California cuisine|California]] twist by adding sliced [[Cookbook:Avocado|avocado]] to the dish.

==Ingredients==
*1 [[Cookbook:Pound|pound]] (450 [[Cookbook:g|g]]) [[Cookbook:Scallop|bay scallops]]
*1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (125 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]] (about 3-4 lemons)
*4 red [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell peppers]], roasted, peeled, and seeded
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] (30 mL) [[Cookbook:Balsamic vinegar|balsamic vinegar]]
*2 tablespoons (30 mL) extra-virgin [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] (2.5 mL) [[Cookbook:Cayenne pepper|cayenne pepper]], ground
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], to taste
*1 [[Cookbook:Avocado|avocado]], peeled and sliced

==Procedure==
#In a non-reactive bowl, combine the scallops and lemon juice, add more juice as needed to cover the scallops. Refrigerate, covered, and stir often for 2 hours, until the scallops become opaque.
#For the [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce]], add the bell peppers, vinegar, oil, cayenne, and salt into a [[Cookbook:Food Processor|food processor]] or [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]], and [[Cookbook:Purée|purée]].
#To serve, spoon the sauce onto individual plates, drain the scallops and place on the sauce.  Garnish with slices of avocado.

Serves 4 as a main dish, 6 as an appetizer.

==Variations==
*For a more [[Cookbook:Southwestern cuisine|Southwestern]] flavor, replace 1/4 cup lemon juice with [[Cookbook:Lime Juice|lime juice]], and replace the bell peppers with New Mexico [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili peppers]].

==Warning==
Eating raw seafood is an effective way to get sick. Scallops are filter feeders found near shore, which makes them particularly filthy if sourced from a polluted area. Make sure you buy your scallops the day you plan to serve them, from a reputable fishmonger who can tell you something about where the scallops have come from, and when they were collected.

'''Soup with Supplì''' - This recipe is not traditional in Italy, where the preparation stops at the cooking of the ''supplì'' (risotto balls), which are actually a little bigger than eggs.

==Ingredients==  
*left over [[Cookbook:Risotto|Risotto]],
*[[Cookbook:Egg|Egg]]s, beaten 
*[[Cookbook:Bread crumbs|Bread crumbs]] 
*clear or brown soup

==Procedure==
If you have some good risotto left, you can use it up by making it into little balls the size of nuts.  Egg and bread crumb and fry them in butter; dry them and put them into a soup tureen with hot soup.  The soup may be either clear or brown.

'''Hard tack''' was used during long sea voyages and military campaigns as a primary foodstuff usually dunked in water, brine, coffee or some other liquid or cooked into a skillet meal.  This cracker was little more than flour and water which had been [[Cookbook:Baking|baked]] hard and would keep for months as long as it was kept dry. Also known as a sea biscuit, sea bread, or ship's biscuits.

==Ingredients==
*2 cups of [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*½ to ¾ cup water
*6 pinches of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Cuisine of Japan]]

== Introduction to Sushi == 
Beginning as a method of [[Cookbook:Pickling|pickling]] [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]] centuries ago, '''sushi''' has evolved into an artful, unique dining experience. In its earliest form, fish was placed between two wads of [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]], producing a moderately complex chemical reaction as the fish fermented helping preserve it. Sometime between the 14th and 16th centuries, rice vinegar started to be added to the rice to help speed up the process which took several months.  Around this time the rice also started to be consumed with the fish it was used to preserve.  ''[[Cookbook:Nori|Nori]]'' (red algae [[Cookbook:Seaweed|seaweed]] paper) was added about this period as a way to keep one's fingers from getting sticky, thus creating the first ancestor of modern 'makizushi', or rolled sushi.

Sometime in the mid to late 18th century a restaurant in Edo (modern Tokyo) started serving sushi rice alone with thinly sliced fresh fish pressed into it.  This was the start of Edo-Mae sushi, which is also known as 'nigirizushi', or pressed sushi. 

Sometime after this, some chef took this one step further and eliminated the sushi rice all together, the birth of sashimi.  It is important to note that sashimi specifically refers to thinly sliced raw or mostly raw fish and shellfish.

It is hard to tell when exactly the wasabi and pickled ginger were added, but it is probable they came in with the Edo-Mae sushi, as this was when the focus of sushi became enjoying the taste of the exceedingly fresh fish, and the condiments heighten the experience.  

Technically, the word &quot;sushi&quot; refers to the vinegared rice, but, colloquially, the term is used to describe a finger-size piece of raw fish or [[Cookbook:Shellfish|shellfish]] on a bed of vinegared rice. This can be eaten as is or dipped into ''shoyu'' (Japanese [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]) and then eaten.  Much care is put into the creation of the dish and the many methods of preparing the food indicate the importance of appearance to the educated consumer.

==Types of Sushi==
Sushi types include ''makizushi'', ''nigirizushi'', ''oshizushi'', and ''inarizushi''.

Makizushi (''rolled sushi''), or maki for short, is the kind that is most common to North American consumers (see [[Cookbook:California Roll|California Rolls]]) as it is basically sushi layered on top of nori, rolled into a tube, and cut into thick slices.  Easy to make and even easier to mass produce, it has found a wide proliferation as a new form of fast food, but still manages to be found in Japanese restaurants that still respect the tradition.

Nigirizushi (''hand formed sushi''), or nigiri for short, is, as stated above, a hand-formed small bed of rice with an ingredient on top (ranging from [[Cookbook:Tuna|tuna]] or [[Cookbook:Salmon|salmon]] to [[Cookbook:Eel|eel]] or [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]).  Nigiri sushi that is served without the rice is called ''sashimi''.  Gunkanmaki (''battleship roll or boat sushi'') is a nigirizushi where an oval piece of sushi rice is surrounded by nori and topped with a topping such as fish eggs.

Oshizushi (''pressed sushi'') is similar to nigirizushi but it is formed by pressing with the aid of an oshibako, a wooden mold.  Generally, the topping is placed in the oshibako first, the rice is added on top, then the combination is pressed together with the oshibako top or lid.  After pressing, the sushi is removed and cut to serving sizes.

Inarizushi (''stuffed sushi'') is generally a pocket or pouch containing the rice and other ingredients.  Materials used to make the pocket include tofu, egg, and cabbage leaves.

Sashimi (basically &quot;sliced raw fish without any rice&quot;) is often the most artistic form, with thin slices of fish and shellfish being formed into a range of diffrent shapes, especially flowers.  While technically not sushi, sashimi is often grouped together with the different types of sushi.

''Saikuzushi'' is an artistic type of sushi, which makes a beautiful image. It is quite difficult to make this, and also quite expensive when bought. Rice is tinted with different colors and later sliced to make an image. 

''Chirashizushi'', or scattered sushi has rice in a box or bowl and seaweed on top. Different kinds of seafood and fish is placed on top, including octopus, squid, tuna, alongside with chopped cucumbers and green onion. 

''Edomae'' - or ''Temakizushi'' - is one of the most common sushi, with rice and fish rolled up in seaweed. Crab, octopus, tuna, shrimp, and several other types of seafood is rolled up inside the rice. It is even found in convenience stores in Japan.

== How to try sushi for the first time ==
Make sure your order is a complete sushi experience that, at minimum, includes [[Cookbook:Miso_Soup|miso soup]], [[Cookbook:Maki|makizushi]] (rolls), [[Cookbook:Sashimi|sashimi]] (pieces of fish), [[Cookbook:Nigirizushi|nigirizushi]], and garnishes of [[Cookbook:Wasabi|wasabi]], [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]], and pickled ginger.  Hot, fresh, green tea is an excellent beverage to drink with your meal.

Mix a small amount of wasabi and soy sauce in the small dish, which will be provided in a sushi restaurant, to a consistency and spicyness that you find enjoyable; you will dip your sushi into it to enhance the flavor. Note: In Japan, it is considered poor dining etiquette to mix wasabi into one's soy sauce.  This is because Japanese sushi chefs will apply a small amount of wasabi to the appropriate types of sushi during preparation.  For example, sushi that features its own unique sauce will be prepared sans wasabi so as not to compromise the flavor.

Start your meal with simple miso soup but do not spend too much time on any one item as this is the proper [[wikipedia:Customs and etiquette of Japan#Eating and drinking|Japanese etiquette]], instead rotate through your meal to appreciate the quality of each aspect. Many people start with a mild sushi, such as tamago &amp;mdash; a sweet, cold omelette &amp;mdash; and end with a stronger taste at the end of the meal, like darker fish. Between different items it is recommended that a piece of pickled ginger be eaten to cleanse the palate and ensure that none of the subtle flavor of the sushi is missed.

Enjoy!

==Serving Sushi==
There are different types of seafood used for sushi, and the most common ones are tuna, salmon, squid and octopus. Using expensive seaweed makes sushi taste much better. Expensive seaweed is darker in color, and is less likely to break when folded or rolled. Cheap seaweed is usually greenish in color. The type of soy sauce (shoyu) used also affects the taste of the sushi; the most commonly used brands are Kikkoman and Yamasa. Many people like to mix wasabi with their shoyu, which makes it quite spicy and wakening.

===Condiments===
Sushi is generally served with
* [[Cookbook:Wasabi|wasabi]]
* green [[Cookbook:Horseradish|horseradish]] (a cheap wasabi substitute)
* gari ([[Cookbook:Pickling|pickled]] [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]])
* [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]
* kabayaki sauce ([[Cookbook:eel_sauce|eel sauce]]) (often served on some sushi, may be used for dipping instead of soy sauce)

'''Tarbes salad''' is salty, sweet, and delicious.

== Ingredients ==

=== Salad ===

*1 white or yellow [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*1 tablespoon of [[Cookbook:Olive oil|olive oil]]
*Half a head of your favorite [[Cookbook:Lettuce|lettuce]]
*About 5 [[Cookbook:Walnuts|walnuts]], broken into bits
*1 ripe [[Cookbook:Orange|orange]], cut into small pieces
*Small chunk of hard [[Cookbook:Blue cheese|blue]] or [[Cookbook:Roquefort cheese|Roquefort cheese]], diced

=== Dressing ===

*50 ml extra virgin [[Cookbook:Olive oil|olive oil]]
*25 ml [[Cookbook:Balsamic vinegar|Balsamic vinegar]]
*1 teaspoon whole grain [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]]
*A squirt of [[Cookbook:Lemon juice|lemon juice]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste

Makes 1 generous salad

== Procedure ==

[[Image:Tarbes_salad.jpg|thumb|right|Tarbes Salad]]
Cut the onion into half moons and brown it in a bit of olive oil. Make it nice and crispy. Once it's done, put it aside in a bowl and squirt a bit of lemon juice on it.

As the onion is cooking, wash the lettuce thoroughly. Soak it several times. Nothing is worse than gritty lettuce in a salad. Break the lettuce into bite-size pieces and drop them in your spinner under running water. Once it's washed, spin it until it's dry. Wet lettuce will dilute the dressing.

Once the lettuce is dry, put it in a bowl. Add the onions, walnuts, orange and cheese.

To make the dressing, just mix the ingredients in a jar and give them a good shake.

Toss everything together in a big bowl and serve.

== Notes, tricks, and variations ==

*Prepare the lettuce and onions early. Add the onions to the lettuce (once they've cooled down) and cover the bowl. This will allow the onions to flavor the lettuce.

*Put a bit of beer in with the onions as you brown them, or even white wine or vermouth.

*Add some minced garlic either to the dressing or to the onions.

*Use a ripe pear or a kiwi instead of the orange.

*Add a sliced up, deeply browned zucchini in addition to or instead of onion.

*If you're in a hurry, skip the onion/zucchini.

*Brown the walnuts with the onions in olive oil.

*Turn the salad into dinner by adding strips of chicken or turkey (heavily salted and peppered, browned in butter).

*Double the dressing ingredients and save yourself the trouble the next day. Also, you can wash and break up all of your lettuce at once and store it in an airtight bag in the crisper drawer of your refrigerator.

'''Louis Dressing''' is a salad dressing commonly used with [[Cookbook:Seafood|seafood]] salads, such as [[Cookbook:Crab Louis|Crab Louis]] and [[Cookbook:Shrimp Louis|Shrimp Louis]].  It can also be used as a dip or sandwich spread, or many other uses.  The dressing is creamy, yet has a little spicy kick.

==Ingredients==
*1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (235 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]]
*1/4 cup (60 mL) cup mild [[Cookbook:Salsa|salsa]], the salsa must have green [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili peppers]]
*1/4 cup (60 mL) [[Cookbook:Ketchup|ketchup]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] (15 mL) [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]
*1 1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] (7 mL) [[Cookbook:Worcestershire Sauce|worcestershire sauce]]
*[[Cookbook:Hot Sauce|hot sauce]] (eg. Tobasco, Crystal), to taste

Makes 1 1/2 cups of dressing.

==Procedure==
#Combine all ingredients in a [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]], and process till smooth.  The goal is to have a pink smooth sauce with little green flecks.
#Pour the sauce into a bowl and chill covered in the refregerator for at least 30 minutes prior to use.

==Notes, tips and variations==

# This is not the &quot;traditional&quot; recipe, but it is the easiest for untrained cooks to succeed at.  For the traditional recipe, replace the salsa and ketchup with 1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Red Chile Sauce|chile sauce]] (or store bought chile sauce), and three tablespoons each of finely minced [[Cookbook:Green Onion|green onion]] and green [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili peppers]].  Instead of using the blender, wisk the ingredients in a bowl.

==Warnings==
* Keep refrigerated
* It is recomended that the dressing be used within 24 hours.
* This recipe uses mayonnaise.  See the module ''[[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]]'' for possible health risks.

Dried red chiles can be soaked and [[Cookbook:Puree|pureed]] to make '''red chile sauce'''.  It can be used in many ways, including as an [[Cookbook:Enchilada|enchilada]] sauce, [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] [[Cookbook:Marinade|marinade]], or in [[Cookbook:Huevos Rancheros|huevos rancheros]].

== Ingredients ==

* 3 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] (90 g) dried [[Cookbook:Chile Pepper|chile peppers]], such as [[Cookbook:New Mexico Chile|New Mexico chile]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] (500 mL) hot water (boiled water that has cooled a little)
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] (15 mL) vegetable [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], chopped
* 3 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], minced
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] (5 mL) ground [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]]
* 1 tablespoon (15 mL) mexican [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]]

== Directions ==

# Wipe chile peppers with a damp cloth to clean. See [[Cookbook:Red Chile Sauce#Warning|warning]] for handling instructions.
# Break off stems, and remove seeds.
# Soak chili peppers in hot water until softened, about an hour.
# Taste the soaking water.  If it is bitter, replace it with fresh water.
# Puree chili pepper and water mixture in a [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]]
# Heat the oil in a pan, add onion, garlic, and seasonings.
# Once the onions are cooked, add the chili puree to the pan.
# [[Cookbook:Simmer|Simmer]] for 15 minutes.
# Return mixture to the blender, and puree.  See [[Cookbook:Red Chile Sauce#Warning|warning]].
# Pour sauce through a [[Cookbook:Sieve|sieve]].  Use a spoon to stir and press the mixture against the sieve to extract all the sauce.
# Add salt to taste.  If the sauce is a little bitter, some sugar can be added to compensate.

== Notes ==

Makes about 2 cups.  Freezes well.

Sauce may stain certain materials, including some plastics.  Store in glass to avoid staining.

== Warning ==

Use caution when handling [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili peppers]].  Wearing rubber gloves is recommended, and be sure to wash the gloves, and your hands, thoroughly after handling the chili peppers. If rubber gloves are not available, rub some oil onto your hands before handling the chilies. The capsaicin in the chili peppers, the chemical that makes them hot, will burn the eyes, nose, or mouth on contact, and exposed skin if left for long. (but you're planning to eat this...)

Use caution when pureeing hot liquids in a blender.  The hot liquid can spill out the top of the blender.  Either allow the sauce to cool first, or hold the lid in place during blending, using a towel or oven glove to protect your hand.  Only fill the blender half full, do multiple batches if required.

[[Image:Spargel sauce hollandaise.jpg|right|thumb|Sauce Hollandaise on boiled white [[Cookbook:Asparagus|asparagus]] and [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]]]
'''Hollandaise''' is a warm emulsion of clarified butter and lemon juice using egg yolk to bind them. This sauce is not exactly Hollandaise but tastes exactly the same and almost never fails. This recipe also does not require a double boiler which is often a handicap in preparing Hollandaise.

==Ingredients==
* 2 [[Cookbook:Egg yolk|egg yolks]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbsp.]] [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]
* 1 tbsp. [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* ¼ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp.]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] 
* ¼ tsp. [[Cookbook:Cayenne pepper|cayenne pepper]]
* 1½ sticks [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], (170[[Cookbook:Gram|g]] or ¾ cup) cut into small pieces
* 1 tsp. parsley

==Procedure==
#Put eggs, lemon juice, water, salt and red pepper into [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]] and beat until streaks form in the bottom of the pan
#Heat on low beating with [[Cookbook:Whisk|whisk]] constantly
#When streaks form with your whisk in bottom of pan add clarified butter piece by piece adding as it melts
#Sauce should thicken as butter is added, when sauce is desired thickness, remove from heat.
#Ad parsley and serve.

==Tips==
* If '''any''' indication of burning is evident, remove pan from heat and whisk rapidly. If that is not enough, dunk the pan into cold water.
* Using clarified butter will allow for a better (easier) emulsion, although much of the flavor in butter comes from those milk solids not found in clarified butter.

==Alternative Method==
For a more traditional recipe, whisk the egg yolks over a double boiler in which the water is hot rather than [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiling]] (i.e. start off [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmering]], do it off the heat). Add the butter one piece at a time, making sure each piece is fully incorporated into the sauce before adding the next. Finish off by adding lemon juice.

A '''koeksister''' is a piece of dough, usually in the shape of a plait, that is deep fried in oil and then dipped in a cold syrup mixture. If you keep your oil hot and the syrup very cold you get the perfect koeksister - crisp and crunchy on the outside and soft, moist and syrupy on the inside. Koeksisters are very rich (i.e. unhealthy) and is usually served as a special treat or kept for festive occasions. Making koeksisters is time-consuming and labour-intensive (another reason why it is not often made in modern day homes), so plan ahead to set a night and day aside for making this delicious treat. The syrup is made the night before to chill in the refrigerator in two containers. While making the koeksisters one of the containers is kept chilled in the refrigerator, to replace the other container of syrup when it heats up after a few batches of the fried dough have been dipped into the first container of syrup. If the syrup isn't cold the dough won't soak up the syrup and you will end up with a dry koeksister.

== Syrup ==
=== Ingredients ===
* 1 kg [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]];
* 500ml (2 cups) water;
* 3cm long piece of fresh [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]] (peeled and bruised) and a few slices of [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]], or;
* 2-3 sticks of [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]];
* 1ml (pinch) cream of tartar;
* pinch of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]].

=== Procedure ===
# Put into a saucepan and bring to [[Cookbook:Boiling|boil]], stirring until the sugar has dissolved. 
# Turn the heat down and [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]] for 5-8 minutes. 
# Cool the syrup to room temperature. 
# Divide it into 2 saucepans and place in the refrigerator to chill overnight.

== Dough ==
=== Ingredients === 
* 240 g [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 4 teaspoons (20ml) [[Cookbook:Baking_powder|baking powder]]
* pinch of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 2 tablespoons (30ml) [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* 125ml (half cup) [[Cookbook:Buttermilk|buttermilk]] '''or''' soured milk '''or''' water and [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]] juice

=== Procedure ===
# Sift together flour, baking powder, salt.
# Rub in butter.
# Add buttermilk.
# Mix into a soft dough and knead thoroughly. (It helps if you oil your hands lightly when starting to knead the dough.)
# Cover the dough with a damp cloth and leave dough to rest for 15 minutes.
# Roll the dough out to a thickness of 5mm and cut into strips 5mm wide and 70mm long (half a cm x 7cm). Press the ends of two or three strips together and twist or plait, press the ends together again. Keep the dough you are not working with covered with a damp cloth.
# [[Cookbook:Deep fry|Deep fry]] in hot [[Cookbook:Oil_and_fat|oil]] until golden brown on both sides.
# Remove with a slotted spoon and dip the pieces immediately in the ice cold syrup.
# Remove and place the koeksisters on a wire rack so that the excess syrup can drain.

Store the koeksisters in a sealed container in the refrigerator. They freeze well and can be served straight from the freezer.

This recipe will yield approx. 3 doz (85g) dainty sized koeksisters - you can make them bigger for a more substantial treat.

A '''Bulghur Burger''' is a tasty [[Cookbook:Vegetarian cuisine|vegetarian]] patty for use in sandwiches.

==Ingredients==

*3 cups water 
*2 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] 
*1 1/2 cups [[Cookbook:Bulgur|bulghur]] 
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]] 
*1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Green onion|scallions]], chopped 
*1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]], grated 
*1/4 cup fresh [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]], chopped 
*1/4 cup [[Cookbook:Tahini|tahini]] 
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Tomato paste|tomato paste]]
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]] 
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Dijon Mustard|Dijon mustard]] 
*dash ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]] 
 
==Preparation==
#Bring the water to a boil.  
#While it is heating, use a heavy pan or [[Cookbook:Frying pan|skillet]] to [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sauté]] the garlic and bulghur in the oil on medium-high heat for 2 minutes, stirring frequently.  
#Add the boiling water.  Return to a boil, cover, and reduce heat to low.  
#Simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, until all of the water is absorbed and the bulghur is soft but still chewy.  
#Preheat the oven to 375 °F (190 °C) if you plan to bake the burgers.  
#When the bulghur is ready, stir in the scallions, carrots, parsley, tahini, tomato paste, soy sauce, mustard, and pepper.  With moistened hands, form the bulghur mixture into 6 to 8 burgers.  
#Cook them in a lightly oiled heavy skillet on medium-low heat for about 10 minutes, flipping the burgers once when the outside is crunchy, or bake on an oiled baking sheet for 20 minutes.

==Tips, tricks and variations==
*For a different flavour and more protein, add 1 cup of mashed cooked [[Cookbook:Chickpea|chickpeas]] to the cooked bulghur along with the other ingredients, before forming the burgers.

==Recipe 1: Chicken Broth (1881 Household Cyclopedia)==

According to the ''1881 Household Cyclopedia'', chicken broth can be made in the following way:

''Select a tender chicken, and after cleaning it, cut it into quarters and place it into a soup kettle with 3 quarts of water, 2 tablespoons of rice, or pearl barley, and salt to taste. Let it boil slowly. Remove the scum (dissolved chicken fat) that rises to the surface. When the chicken is thoroughly done, remove it and place it on a dish, garnish with double parsley, and eat with drawn butter. Serve the broth in a deep-covered china bowl or tureen, and send to table hot.''

==Recipe 2: Chicken soup with rice and potatoes==
===Ingredients===
*2 whole chickens
*2 quarts water
*3 cups rice
*2 onion, minced
*7-8 turnips, pared and diced
*2 cups sugar
*3 white potatoes, peeled and quartered 
*habañero, salt, and pepper to taste
*2 Tbsp parsley, minced
*parsley for garnish

===Procedure===
Clean and wash the two chickens and boil in about 2 quarts of water, to which add three cups of rice, 2 onions cut fine, 7 or 8 turnips pared and cut into small pieces, 2 cupfuls of white sugar, a little sweet marjoram, and salt, habañero, and pepper to taste. 
Simmer for 100 minutes, then add 3 white potatoes, peeled, washed, and cut in quarters.

Simmer for 40 additional minutes, then add 1 tablespoon minced parsley.  Adjust seasonings to taste.  

Serve hot, garnished with sprigs of double parsley.

==Recipe 3: Joaquin Murietta's Grandmother's Chicken Soup Recipe (Public Domain)==

===Ingredients:===
*1 whole chicken (without gizzards) or 3 pounds chicken parts
*1 large whole carrot, washed
*4 sprigs of parsley
 
===Instructions:===
*Place ingredients in a large stock pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil and reduce to simmer for 4 hours or until chicken is falling off the bone. Strain broth into another pot and let cool. 
*Place pot in refrigerator for 24 hours. Fat will rise to the top and congeal. Remove the fat. 
*Optional: Remove meat from the chicken parts. Add it back into the soup or make chicken tacos (be careful to remove all the bones).

This dressing is similar to several commercial brands.  It is excellent on salad, rice or as a marinade.  

== Ingredients ==
*1 1/3 Cup [[Cookbook:Canola Oil|Canola Oil]]
* 2/3 Cup Water
*6     T [[Cookbook:Tahini|Tahini]]
*6     T [[Cookbook:Cider vinegar|Cider Vinegar]] (Heinze)
*4     T [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|Lemon Juice]] (RealLemon)
*5     T [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|Soy Sauce]] (Kikkoman)
*6     cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|Garlic]]
* 1/8 tsp [[Cookbook:Xanthan gum|Xanthan gum]]

*2     T [[Cookbook:Sesame Seed|Sesame seeds]] Toasted
*2     T [[Cookbook:Parsley|Parsley]]
*2     T [[Cookbook:Chive|Chives]]

== Procedure ==
# In a blender combine first eight ingredients and mix on high for about two minutes. You will see a change in the texture of the mixture as the Xanthan gum starts to work, the result is a very smooth, creamy appearance.
# Add the final three ingredients and blend on low, just until mixed. 

Makes about three 8oz. bottles @ ~$.75ea.

== Notes, tips and Variations ==
* Xanthan gum is available in grocery stores, look in the natural grains section.  It is a white powder, about $10 for an 8oz bag.
* Be careful with the Xanthan gum; too much and the mixture will turn into a rubbery glob, too little and the oil and water will separate.
* If brand substitutions are made then the recipe may need adjustment.  This dressing has a very strong flavors that need to be balanced.  When in balance, the flavor really explodes.

[[Image:tartiflette_and_Fried_Ham.jpg|thumb|212px|A cooked tartiflette and fried ham.]]'''Tartiflette''' is a [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|French dish]] from the Savoy region. It originated in the valley of Aravis, home of [[Cookbook:Reblochon Cheese|reblochon cheese]]. It is not, however, a traditional dish and was, in fact, invented and launched only in the 1980s by the Reblochon trade union in an attempt to increase sales of the cheese. Different valleys in the region have different methods of producing tartiflette and there are probably more than one recipe per village.  All recipes have potatoes, cheese, and some kind of meat such as slab bacon or salt pork. One example of a recipe is shown below.  

==Ingredients==
*1-3/4 pounds Yukon Gold [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] (5 or 6 medium-sized ones, all the same size) or waxy boiling potatoes (Cara also work)
*5 or 6 ounces slab [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]], or [[Cookbook:Salt Pork|salt pork]], cut into lardons about 1&quot; x 1/4&quot; by 1/4&quot;
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*1 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]] (about 6 ounces, peeled), finely chopped
*1/4 cup dry [[Cookbook:White Wine|white wine]] or dry [[Cookbook:Vermouth|vermouth]]
*6 tablespoons heavy [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]] (1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons)
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste, probably at least 1/2 teaspoon salt, possibly more
*1/2 of a 1-pound [[Cookbook:Reblochon Cheese|reblochon cheese]]

==Procedure==
[[Image:Tartiflette_in_Preparation.jpg|thumb|212px|A tartiflette with half a Reblochon on it before baking.]]

#Use potatoes that are all the same size so that they will cook evenly. Boil them in their skins for exactly 20 minutes, until they&amp;#8217;re just beginning to get tender.  Do not overcook! Rinse with cold water to stop the cooking.
#While still warm, peel the potatoes with your fingers, then use a large, very sharp knife to cut them into slices about 1/3-inch thick.  Then cut the slices into rough cubes.
#While the potatoes are cooking, slice the slab bacon or salt pork into slices about 1/4-inch thick.  Then cut into lardons about 1/4-inch across.
#Melt the butter in a large sauté pan, then cook the lardons over medium-high heat until crisp and golden brown.  Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside, leaving the bacon fat in the pan.
#Preheat the oven to 350 °F.
#Cook the onions in the bacon fat over medium heat, stirring often, until wilted and slightly golden. Drain in a strainer, pressing with a spoon to remove as much fat as possible, and leave them there.
#Pour off the fat in the pan, return the bacon and onions, and add the wine.  Cook over high heat until the wine is nearly evaporated.
#Add the diced potatoes and cook for a minute or so, stirring constantly until all the ingredients are well mixed together.
#Add the cream and salt and pepper to taste.  Try using a little more salt than you might think is necessary, at least 1/2 teaspoon.  Stir all the ingredients together for a minute.
#Lightly butter the inside of an 10- or 11-inch earthenware baking dish.  Add the potato mixture and smooth the surface.
#Cut the Reblochon in two down across the top so that you have two pieces in the shape of a half-moon.  Put one of the pieces away for another use. Use a sharp knife to lightly score the crust of the remaining half-cheese about every inch, including its side.  Then carefully slice horizontally through its center so that you now have two half-moon pieces.
#Place the two pieces of cheese crust-side-up on top of the potatoes so that they form a circular cheese again.  Cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil and bake in the center of the oven for 1 hour.
#Remove the foil and stir the cheese, including the crust, into the potatoes, mixing well.
#Place 5 or 6 inches under the broiler and cook until golden brown on top.123

Quick, simple, refreshing. Just like a salad should be.

Use fresh, young broad beans. If you can't find them soft enough to eat raw, cook in boiling water for the shortest time possible, and rinse in cold.

== Ingredients ==
*[[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
*[[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*[[Cookbook:Broad Bean|broad beans]]
*[[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]

It is impossible to list exact quantities, since it all depends on how much peas you extract from the beans.

== Procedure ==
# Peel the broad beans, and discard any nasty looking peas.
# Chop tomatoes to cubed, about a cm thick. The volume of chopped tomatoes should be roughly twice that of the peas. 
# Chop onion(s) very thinly. The amount depends on how spicy you like your salad.
# Mix it all together, then sprinkle salt and olive oil generously.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of South Africa|South Africa]] | [[Cookbook:Sausage|Sausage]]

Traditionally eaten at ''braais'', barbecues, '''boerewors''' (Afrikaans: farmer's sausage) are thick, hearty and flavoursome Afrikaner sausages, often eaten with a [[Cookbook:Corn|corn]] porridge called ''pap''.

There is no one definitive recipe for boerewors, as nearly every family has its own variation. Some other recipes use bacon and springbok meat.

This version uses a sausage maker, and makes about 6lb of sausage.

==Ingredients==
*2 lb [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]
*2 lb [[Cookbook:Mutton|mutton]]
*2 lb [[Cookbook:Veal|veal]]
*¼ lb. [[Cookbook:Spek|spek]]
*1½ Tbsp. [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1 tsp. ground black pepper.
*1 Tbsp. [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]], singed[[Cookbook:Boerewors#Singeing coriander|¹]] and ground
*¼ tsp ground [[Cookbook:Cloves|cloves]]
*½ tsp grated [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]]
*½ tsp ground [[Cookbook:Allspice|allspice]]
*½ cup brown [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
*1½ [[brandy]] (optional)
*2¼ wide [[Cookbook:Sausage casings|sausage casings]]

==Singeing coriander==
Singed coriander is often used to spice Afrikaner dishes.
#Place seeds into a dry frying pan.
#Put the pan onto low heat and allow coriander to burn slightly.
#Break seeds apart with a fork.
Use a coffee grinder instead off a fork; for this quantity of meat, add 50ml to 60ml of coriander.

==Method==
#Cut all meat and spek into cubes.
#Mix spek and meat together thoroughly, and then coarsely [[Cookbook:Mincing|mince]].
#Add all dry spices, vinegar, and if used, brandy.
#Mix together lightly with a large, two-pronged fork.
#Place the casings in water.
#Place mixture in fridge for 2 hours to blend the flavours together, leaving the casings to soak for the same time.
#Fit casings over sausage maker, and fill with the meat/spice mixture. Be very careful not to over- or understuff the boerewors, as doing so will ruin them.
#Traditionally, boerewors have been hung up in a dry room to dry for days, (to make what is known as droe wors or &quot;dried&quot; wors) but you can simply put them in the fridge for 24 hours before eating them as fresh wors.
#Cook on a barbecue, but do not prick to allow juices to escape as much of the flavour will escape with them. Cook until still pink and juicy inside
#Boerewors can be stored for up to 3 weeks frozen.

==Notes, tips and variations==

* Add about 100ml of regular oatmeal &amp;ndash; this helps to bind the meat. 
* Be careful not to overspice the mince, you will ruin the taste. 
* Be careful with adding salt, the spek has plenty as well.

'''Six Layer Casserole''' - A great recipe when friends are visiting. The preparation can all be done hours in advance.

==Ingredients==
*2 cups diced [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]
*1/2 cup raw [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]]
*1 lb. [[Cookbook:Beef|ground beef]]
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]] diced
*1/2 cup diced [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Black Pepper|pepper]]
*1 10 oz. can [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]] soup (you may also use home canned tomato sauce)
*2 cups water

==Procedure==
Spread layers of raw vegetables and rice in a 9&quot; x 9&quot; baking dish in the order mentioned above and crumble raw hamburger on the top. Mix the soup and water and pour over all. Add salt and pepper on top. Bake about 1 1/2 - 2 hours at 350 degrees. Serves 6. If you double the recipe, use a tall 9&quot; x 13&quot; baking dish and bake it a little longer.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
After dishing some of the casserole to your plate, spread ketchup over the top. It may sound odd but it tastes great.

'''Panch Puran''' (also called '''Panch Phoran''', '''Panch Phoron''', or '''Bengali Five-Spice Mix''') is a spice mixture used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian cuisine]]. It is made of equal parts of five spices:

*[[Cookbook:Fenugreek|fenugreek seed]] (''methi'')
*[[Cookbook:Nigella|nigella seed]] (''kalo jira'')
*[[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard seed]] (''rai'' or ''shorshe'')
*[[Cookbook:Fennel|fennel seed]] (''mouri'')
*[[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin seed]] (''jeera'') 

In some variations, wild [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]] is used in place of cumin.  In other variations, [[Cookbook:Radhuni|radhuni seed]] is added to the mixture.

The name simply means &quot;five spices&quot; in [[Wikipedia:Bengali language|Bengali]].

In [[Cookbook:Bengali cuisine|Bengali cuisine]], the seeds are usually fried in [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] (or [[Cookbook:Ghee|ghee]]), which causes them to start crackling immediately. [[Cookbook:Vegetable|Vegetables]] (especially [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]), [[Cookbook:Dal|dal]], or [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]] are then added.  It is not used with [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]].

This technique is also known as 'blooming '.

Though instant [[w:yeast|yeast]]s are now available which can be mixed directly with the dry ingredients in a recipe, many people find that this technique still improves the quality and rising times of bread. Proofing is also the easiest way to determine if an old packet of yeast is still viable. 

== Ingredients ==
* 1/2 cup of warm water or other liquid reserved from the bread recipe
* 1 teaspoon of sugar
* 1 tablespoon of yeast, or as called for in the recipe
* 1/4 teaspoon of ginger

== Procedure ==
Make sure the water is warm and between 112 and 120. Hot water (above 49C/120F) could kill the yeast, and water above 60C/140F definitely will. Cold water will significantly slow yeast growth. A general guideline is to stick your finger into the water; if you find it warm and comfortable, so will the yeast.

Thoroughly stir the ingredients into the water, making sure everything dissolves properly (yeast, in some forms, is rather prone to forming clumps at the bottom). Let this mixture sit in a warm place until there is a bubbly froth on top. Depending on the type of yeast, this will take between 10 and 30 minutes, and should yield a &quot;head&quot; of at least one centimeter. Use as indicated in your recipe. If no bubbles develop, discard and obtain new yeast.

== Yeast Cake Substitution ==
Many older cookbooks will often have recipes calling for a &quot;yeast cake&quot;. This is a small cake of active yeast, often 0.6 ounces (17 grams) in weight. They are not normally used today since they are highly perishable and have a short shelf life, even when refrigerated (about 10 days). 1 Yeast Cake can be substituted with 1 packet or 2 1/4 teaspoons of Active Dry Yeast. To substitute a 2 ounce yeast cake, use 3 packets or 6 3/4 teaspoons of Active Dry Yeast.

'''Biscuits''' - These biscuits are tall, light, and flaky. They are less salty than many bought mixes. They taste good plain or with [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]], [[Cookbook:Jam|jam]], or [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausage]]/[[Cookbook:Ham|ham]] [[Cookbook:Gravy|gravy]].

==Ingredients==
*3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] (Preferably a soft wheat flour; look for flour labled &quot;soft wheat&quot; or &quot;better for biscuits&quot;. If no soft flour is available, mixing three parts all-purpose with one part cake flour will get you close.)
*4 1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp.]] [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
*3/4 tsp. [[Cookbook:Cream of tartar|cream of tartar]]
*2 1/2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]

#Beat egg lightly and add to milk.
#Add liquid to dry ingredients and mix with fork until dough holds together.
#Turn out onto floured board and knead lightly with floured fingers.
#Roll out 3/4 inch thick and cut with floured cutter (a round cookie cutter).
#Place on baking sheet and bake at [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|450°F]] for 12 minutes.

'''French Fries''' (or '''chips''') are a well-known element of fast food.
 
==Ingredients==
*[[Cookbook:Potato|potato]]es
*[[Cookbook:Cooking oil|cooking oil]]
*[[Cookbook:Paper towel|paper towel]]s
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

==Procedure==

#Peel potatoes
#Slice potatoes into thin straw-like pieces.
#Wash well with water to remove excess starch.
#Place fries in a pan with water and simmer/par boil on the stove for about 15 mins.
#Sieve and dry fries off.
#[[Cookbook:Deep fry|Deep fry]] at 175°C in vegetable oil or lard/dripping for 4 to 5 minutes to a light golden crisp. 
#Remove and place on plate with paper towels to absorb the leftover cooking oil.
#Transfer to another plate if necessary.
#Add salt and shake to ensure all french fries are evenly salted.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Vary the size of the potato slices.  Thick wedge shapes become Home Style Fries or English Style Chips, while thinly [[Cookbook:Julienne|julienned]] potatoes make for Shoestring Potatoes.  Cooking times will need to be adjusted.
*Try adding other [[Cookbook:Spices|spices]] after cooking.  Minced [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] is popular in [[Cookbook:California cuisine|California cuisine]]. 
*Instead of ketchup, serve with [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]], [[Cookbook:Gravy|gravy]], barbecue sauce, or [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], hummus, &amp; [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]].
*For [[Cookbook:Poutine|poutine]], (a French-Canadian treat,) toss cooked fries with cheese curds and smother with [[Cookbook:Gravy|gravy]].

==Safety==
* If the oil becomes too hot, it may catch fire.  '''Do not attempt to extinguish it with water''', as this will cause an explosive reaction. More information on chip pan fires can be found [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip_pan_fire here].

'''Fried eggs''', a popular breakfast dish in the United States, Canada, and Western Europe, take about 5 minutes to prepare.  They are often served with toast or with other fried dishes.

==Ingredients==
*2 teaspoons of [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] (or [[Cookbook:Olive oil|olive oil]])
*2 or 3 large [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]], depending on appetite
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste

==Equipment==
*A small (10&quot;) [[Cookbook:Frying pan|frying pan]]
*A [[Cookbook:Spatula|spatula]] 
*Gas ring, at medium heat

==Method==  
[[Image:Fried egg, sunny side up.jpg|thumb|right|Sunny Side Up fried egg]]
#Melt the butter in the pan over medium heat
#Crack open the eggs into the pan and let fry until the yolks begin to harden at the edges (indicated by a lightening in the yolk color). 
#Using the spatula, flip the eggs over and allow to cook ten seconds for over-easy, or up to one minute for over-hard. 
#Add salt and pepper to taste, and serve.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*It often considered a cardinal sin to allow the yolk of an egg to break (although some prefer fried eggs with broken yolks). If the cook ensures that the eggs are fresh the yolks will be more 'pert', and less liable to break. 
*For ''Sunnyside Up'', do not flip the eggs.  Use a slightly lower heat, and cover the pan with a lid for some of the cooking period.  An ideal sunnyside up has a runny yolk, but the white should be cooked. Uncooked white (often called jelly) is normally unwanted and less-prefered than a partially cooked yolk, so err on the side of overcooking rather than undercooking the eggs.  
*For a richer taste, try sprinkling with grated [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|parmesan]] or freshly chopped [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]] and [[Cookbook:Chive|chives]].
*When frying eggs for [[Cookbook:Sandwiches|sandwiches]], [[Cookbook:Rolls|rolls]] or [[Cookbook:Wrap|wraps]], it is often a good idea to break the yolks. This increases the coverage of yolk so that every bite gets some yolk, and prevents uncooked yolk dripping out.

==Olive Oil Fried Eggs==
#Heat 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil over a low-medium heat ( you will break the olive oil if you heat it to much).
#Crack open one egg into the pan and let fry while splashing some hot oil on the yolk so as to cook the top, if the egg begins to bubble, lower the heat.
#DO NOT FLIP THE EGG, it will cook with the hot oil you are splashing on it. 
#Serve, add salt and pepper to taste. 
Ideally you will get a chunk of feta cheese, place next to eggs and pour the remaining hot oil on the cheese not only softening the cheese but basting and cooking at the same time, the smell is incredible and the taste is old world. Heat some bread and Use it to soak up the oil... AMAZING !!!

==Warnings==
*Many people prefer their eggs not fully cooked.  Please see the module ''[[Cookbook:Egg|Egg]]'' for possible health concerns of eating raw eggs.

'''Tomatoes with Cheese Stuffing''' - The addition of cheese to the stuffing used in stuffed tomatoes means added flavor, as well as nutritive value in the form of protein, the food substance in which the tomatoes themselves are lacking. The bread crumbs used for the stuffing supply a large amount of carbohydrate, so that the completed dish, besides being a very attractive one, contains all the food principles in fairly large quantities. Stuffed tomatoes may be served as the main dish in a light meal or as a vegetable dish in a heavy meal.

==Ingredients==
*6 [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
*1 cup bread crumbs
*1 cup grated [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]]

'''Apple Tapioca''' - The combination of fruit and tapioca is agreeable to most people. Peaches and apples, either fresh or canned, are used most often for this purpose. For this recipe, the apples should be somewhat sour, as there will then be more character to the dessert. Canned or fresh peaches or canned pineapple may be used in exactly the same way as apples. If canned fruit is used, not so much sugar nor baking in the oven will be necessary.

==Ingredients==
*3/4 cup pearl [[Cookbook:Tapioca|tapioca]] or 1/2 c. minute tapioca (instant)
*2 cups boiling water
*1/2 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*6 [[Cookbook:Apple|apples]]
*1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]]
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]

==Procedure==
#If pearl tapioca is used, soak it for 4 or 5 hours and then drain off all the water. Minute tapioca will need no soaking. Add the tapioca to the boiling water and salt.
#Cook in a double boiler until the tapioca is entirely transparent. 
#Pare (peel) and core the apples. Place them in a buttered baking dish, fill each cavity with sugar and cinnamon, and place a piece of butter on top of each. 
#Pour the hot tapioca over these, place in a hot oven, and bake until the apples are soft. 
#Serve either hot or cold with sugar and cream.

'''Hominy''' - Although prepared hominy may be purchased, some people prefer to prepare it themselves. Hominy serves as a foundation from which many satisfactory dishes can be made, as it is high in food value and reasonable in cost. This cereal can be used in so many ways that it is advisable to prepare enough at one time to meet the demands of several meals. The following recipe for making hominy should provide 3 quarts of this cereal; however, as is true of other recipes--a point that should be remembered throughout the various lessons--the quantities given may be increased or decreased to meet with the requirements of the household. '''Please read the warning below before making hominy.'''

==Ingredients==
*2 qt. water
*1 Tb. [[Cookbook:Lye|Lye]]
*1 qt. shelled [[Cookbook:Maize|Corn]]
*3 tsp. [[Cookbooks:Salt|Salt]]

==Procedure==
Put the water into a large kettle or saucepan, and into the water put the lye. Allow the water to come to the boiling point, and then add the corn and let it boil until the skins will slip off the grains when they are pressed between the thumb and the finger. Take from the stove, stir sufficiently to loosen the skins, and then remove them by washing the grains of corn in a coarse colander. Cover the grains with cold water and return to the fire. When the water boils, pour it off. Repeat this process at least three times, so as to make sure that there is no trace of the lye, and then allow the grains to cook in more water until they burst. Season them with the salt, and while the hominy thus prepared is still hot put it into a jar or a crock and cover it tight until it is to be used. The water in which the hominy is cooked should remain on it.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
Use hominy in other recipes such as [[Cookbook:Hominy Grits|Hominy Grits]]

This recipe was copied from &quot;Woman's Institute Library of Cookery, Vol. 1&quot; found at http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06/8loc110h.htm and wikified for this cookbook.

==Warnings==
Lye is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caustic '''caustic'''] and must be handled with care! Lye may cause '''serious burns'''. Before using lye, please read the article: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide Sodium Hydroxide]. If you decide to use lye, add it gradually to the bulk of the water while stiring to dissipate the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvation heat of solution]. See also [http://www.uga.edu/nchfp/publications/uga/hominy_without_lye.html Hominy without Lye].

Nothing more delicious in the way of cake can be made than '''sunshine cake'''. It is especially nice to serve with a frozen dessert of some kind, for it is not too rich and it is attractive in color.

==Ingredients==
*6 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
*1/3 tsp. [[Cookbook:Cream of tartar|cream of tartar]]
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*3/4 cup [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon juice]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]]

==Procedure==
Separate the eggs. Beat the yolks with a rotary beater until they are thick and lemon-colored. Beat the egg whites until they are foamy, add the cream of tartar, and continue beating until they are dry. Fold the sugar into the egg whites and then fold the yolks into this mixture. Sift the flour several times and add it. Add the lemon juice and vanilla, pour into a sponge-cake pan, and bake.

A delicious sandwich for breakfast and fast food!

==Ingredients==
*2 slices [[Cookbook:Bread|brown bread]]
*1 clove [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Chili|green chili]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]]
*5 long slices extra mature [[Cookbook:Cheddar cheese|cheddar cheese]]

*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Black Pepper|black pepper]], to taste

==Preparation==
#Toast the two slices of brown bread, until one of the two is not soft anymore (the second one can be).
#Rub the garlic clove on the hard piece of toasted bread, until only a little piece is left. Chop what's left, and scatter on the bread.
#Cut the tomato in two, and crush each side on the same piece of bread. Then spread the juice, cut what's left of the tomato, and put it on the bread.
#Add the olive oil, by being careful not to add more oil than there is bread.
#Add the salt and pepper. Slice or crush the chili, and scatter on the piece of bread. Add the lemon juice.
#Neatly add the slices of cheddar, then close the sandwich with the remaining piece of bread.

==Tips, tricks and variations==
*If you prefer warm sandwiches, the same sandwich can be baked in the oven for a couple of minutes, until the tomatoes and garlic are half-cooked and the cheddar has melted (be careful not to burn it). Avoid the microwave.

'''Succotash''' - A recipe with a great name.

==Ingredients==
*2 quarts shelled [[Cookbook:Lima beans|Lima beans]]
*12 ears of [[Cookbook:Maize|corn]] cut off the cob
*1 pound of pickled [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]]
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Baking sugar|sugar]]
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*[[Cookbook:Black Pepper|pepper]]

==Procedure==
Cover pork with water, and parboil it; add beans cooked until they burst; then add corn, sugar, butter, and pepper to taste.  After corn is added, watch carefully to keep from scorching.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
This recipe was copied from &quot;Recipes tried and true&quot; found at http://www.gutenberg.net/etext97/tandt10.txt and wikified for this cookbook.

The pork is commonly omitted for a [[Cookbook:Vegetarian recipes|vegetarian]] side-dish.

In some recipes, a red bell pepper (chopped) is added.

One variation which is similar to [[Cookbook:Glottucks|glottucks]] is to add 1/2 cup dried  [[Cookbook:Kelp|sea kelp]], chopped.  In the vegetarian variation, the kelp is sauted in butter first, and then the remaining ingredients are added.

== Ingredients ==
*6 medium-size baking [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] or leftover cooked potatoes
*¾ cup [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*4 oz. [[Cookbook:Velveeta|Velveeta]], chopped into chunks
*4 oz. [[Cookbook:Cheddar Cheese|Cheddar cheese]], chopped into chunks
*2 tbsp. [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Garlic Powder|garlic powder]]
*1 tbsp. dried [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]] flakes

== Procedure ==
If you are using leftover baked potatoes, skip baking instructions. To use leftover boiled potatoes, bake for 10 minutes in a 400º oven to brown skins.

Wash potatoes, prick all over with a fork, then bake until done. You can bake for about 45 minutes in a 400º oven if you prefer, or microwave on high for 6 minutes, then bake for 10 minutes in a 400º oven to brown skins. Let cool until they can be handled, or use hot pads and be careful. 

Cut potatoes in half lengthwise and carefully scoop out the insides. Put the potato skins in a baking dish (any kind will work as long as it is big enough to fit all of them). Put the insides into a bowl (if you want to use a microwave) or a saucepan to make the filling on the stove.

Mash potatoes. (The back of a spoon is sufficient here; most lumps will disappear as the filling is stirred.) Add all other ingredients and stir. If you are using the stove, turn to medium low and keep stirring until cheese is melted and potatoes are smooth. If potatoes are still slightly crunchy, turn heat up to medium until they are soft. To use microwave, heat the filling on high for 1 minute at a time, stirring between each heating period, until filling is smooth. If mixture is too thick to stir easily, add extra milk or water.

Distribute the filling among the potato shells, then bake in a 400º oven until tops are browned (about 15 minutes).

== Variations ==
*Add 1/4 cup crumbled bacon to filling.
*Add 1/4 cup chopped ham to filling.
*Sprinkle grated cheese or fresh chives on top of each potato before final baking.
*Pipe filling through a decorating tip for a fancier look.

We have two versions of '''pumpkin scones''', one savory and one sweet.

==Savory Pumpkin Scones==
===Ingredients===
*2 cups [[Cookbook:Self-raising flour|self-raising flour]], sifted 
*¼ cup skim [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] powder 
*2 [[Cookbook:Green onion|spring onions]], chopped (a.k.a. shallots, green onions)
*¼ tsp. ground [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]] 
*¾ cup cold cooked [[Cookbook:Pumpkin|pumpkin]] 
*½ cup [[Cookbook:Buttermilk|buttermilk]] 
*½ cup natural mineral water 
*[[Cookbook:Cottage Cheese|Cottage cheese]] or [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], for serving (optional)

===Procedure===
# Preheat oven to 220°C (430°F). 
# Combine the flour, milk powder, onion and nutmeg. 
# Fold through the pumpkin, buttermilk and mineral water to make the dough. 
# Pat out the mixture onto a lightly floured board and roll out to a thickness of about ⅝&quot;. 
# Using a 2&quot; scone cutter, press out 12 rounds. 
# Place these on a lightly floured baking tray and bake at 220°C for 12&amp;ndash;15 minutes or until golden. 
# Serve with dollops of cottage cheese or butter.

==Sweet Pumpkin Scones==
===Ingredients===
*¼ cup butter or [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]], softened slightly
*¼ cup [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
*2 Tbsp. [[Cookbook:Corn Syrup|corn syrup]] 
*1 cup cooked, mashed [[Cookbook:Butternut Squash|butternut squash]], pumpkin, or other squash
*2⅔ cups all-purpose [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*2 tsp. [[Cookbook:Cream of Tartar|cream of tartar]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]]
*pinch of salt
*½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
*pinch of ground [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
*⅓ cup milk (or less)

===Procedure===
#Stir together the flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, salt, ground nutmeg and ground ginger.  
#In a separate bowl, beat butter and sugar together with an electric mixer.  Add in the egg and corn syrup (mix the rest with a spoon so it won't be over-mixed).
#Stir in the squash and half of the sifted dry ingredients.
#Add the rest of the dry ingredients with just enough of the milk to make a soft dough.  If it is too sticky to work, add a sprinkle (or two) of flour.
#Knead only a little, gently, until you can pat it out into a big flat rectangle about ¾&quot; thick (just under an inch).
#Cut into 12 pieces with a floured knife. Transfer to a lightly greased oven tray (I used my large pizza pan, which only just accommodated them).
#Bake at 230°C (450°F) for 18 minutes.

This is a simple way to serve [[Cookbook:Fiddlehead|fiddleheads]]. If fiddleheads are unavailable or out of season, [[Cookbook:Asparagus|asparagus]] or [[Cookbook:Artichoke|artichoke hearts]] could be substituted with good results.

It goes well with a simple [[Cookbook:Salad|salad]], crusty [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] and a nice dry [[Cookbook:White Wine|white wine]].

==Ingredients==
*1 [[Cookbook:Pound|pound]] [[Cookbook:Fiddlehead|fiddleheads]], cleaned and trimmed
*2 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], minced
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*1 small [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*1 large portobello [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushroom]] cap
*170g (6 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounces]]) oil-packed sun-dried [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]] (approx)
*half a box of [[Cookbook:Linguine|linguine]]
*1 tablespoon toasted [[Cookbook:Pine Nut|pine nuts]]
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|parmesan cheese]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste

==Procedure==
#Slice the mushrooms, onions, and sun-dried tomatoes into long strips and set aside.
#[[Cookbook:Sautéing|Sauté]] the ferns and garlic in the olive oil for about 5 to 10 minutes.
#Add the onions and sauté until they start to wilt.
#Add the mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes. Continue to sauté for another 5 minutes or so.
#Season with salt and pepper, toss in the pine nuts, add a splash of water, reduce heat and cover. Let sweat for about 10 minutes (or so).
#During this have the linguine begin to cook so that it is ready when the topping is ready.
#In a pasta bowl, add the veggies to the linguine, sprinkle on the cheese, and toss.
#Serve immediately.

      <comment>Sherry vinegar is only in culinary use for 50 years or so; traditional to use white wine vinegar</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Spain|Cuisine of Spain]]

'''Gazpacho''' is a hearty soup that is served cold, making it a perfect way to cool down and replenish the body on a hot, summer day in Andalucía.  This is the classic gazpacho recipe, but there are many other variations.  Gazpacho is typically served along with the main course, or afterward.  Some Spaniards serve it in a glass, as a beverage to accompany the meal.

==Ingredients==
* 1 lb /450 g [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
* ½ lb / 225 g [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|green peppers]] (bell pepper, capsicum)
* ½ [[Cookbook:Cucumber|cucumber]]
* a few [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]] leaves
* clove of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* 2 oz / 50 g white bread, 2-3 days old (also optional, leave out for a thinner soup)
* ½ mild [[Cookbook:Onion|Spanish onion]]
* 1 tbsp [[Cookbook:Wine vinegar|white wine vinegar]] or [[Cookbook:Sherry vinegar|sherry vinegar]]
* 2 tbsp [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* ⅓ pt iced water
* [[Cookbook:Salt|sea salt]] and [[Cookbook:Black pepper|black pepper]]
* ice cubes

Optional
* ¼ [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chilli pepper]], seeds removed 

===Garnish===
* 1 tomato, skinned
* ½ green pepper
* ¼ peeled cucumber
* bread

==Procedure==
Skin the tomatoes and cut into quarters. Remove seeds and stalks from peppers. Peel the cucumber and cut into chunks. Tear up the bread and soak it in water for 30 minutes and then squeeze it dry. Cut up the onion.

Blend all the ingredients until roughly chopped, not too fine, because the soup should have texture and discernible vegetable bits. Pour into large bowl with some ice, add salt and pepper. Then prepare the garnishes. Dice the bread and fry it in a little olive oil until brown. Chop the other vegetables finely. Serve in separate little bowls on the table, so that guests can sprinkle on their own toppings.

Serve chilled.

This is a recipe for '''Ayam goreng kuning''', the traditional fried chicken dish popular in Indonesia. As with most Indonesian poultry recipes, free-range chicken gives the best results. Cut the chicken as you would normally cut chicken for frying.

==Ingredients==

* [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]]
* [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]]
* [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]] (just a little)
* [[Cookbook:Galangal|galanga]]
* [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* desiccated (dried) [[Cookbook:Coconut|coconut]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste
* fried [[Cookbook:Shallot|shallot]] for [[Cookbook:Garnish|garnish]]
* cooking [[Cookbook:Oil|Oil]], for deep frying

==Directions==

# Mix all of the spices except the coconut together with a small amount of water. Use either a mortar or food processor to make a paste.
# Add the coconut to the spice paste. Do not process any longer.
# In a pot, boil the chicken along with the spice paste on low heat. Add salt and pepper to taste. Cook until all the water has gone.
# In a deep fryer, heat the cooking oil. When the oil is hot enough, deep fry the chicken.
# Remove the chicken and filter the cooking oil. Put the oil back in the deep fryer. Put the chicken along with all filtered spices on top of paper towels.
# After deep frying all of the chicken, put all spices left in the boiling pot into the deep fryer. IMPORTANT: make sure the spice paste is dry enough before frying. Excessive water may explode! If everything is correct, you should see brown particles in the cooking oil. Filter the oil, and sprinkle the fried spice paste on top of the chicken.

Serve with steamed rice and raw vegetables (cabbage, Chinese long beans, and sliced cucumbers). Sprinkle the fried shallot over the rice.

'''blini''' (singular blin; in Russian, блин[ы]) are small [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Russia|Russian]] [[Cookbook:Pancake|pancakes]], typically topped with [[Cookbook:Sour Cream|sour cream]], [[Cookbook:Jam|jam]] or [[Cookbook:Caviar|caviar]].

The following recipe makes 20-25 blini.

== Ingredients ==
*1.3 [[Cookbook:Pound|pounds]] (5 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]]) of wheat [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]

* 3 [[Cookbook:egg|egg]]s
* 2-3 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] (optional)
* 2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]]s [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]

* 1/8 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Black pepper|black pepper]] (or to taste)
* 1/4 cup [[Cookbook:Grating|grated]] old [[Cookbook:Cheddar cheese|cheddar cheese]] (optional)

== Instructions ==

# Crack eggs into a measuring cup.
# Add the milk (if desired) and salt.
# Using a [[whisk]] or fork, beat the mixture until foamy. 
# Melt 2 tsp. butter in a frying pan on medium heat
# Pour eggs into frying pan.
# Stir mixture to break up the egg as it cooks and allow more liquid to touch the hot pan. Stiring rapidly will create small curds, while slower stiring will create larger curds.
# Cook until just before you feel that they are done, since the eggs will continue to cook after being removed from the pan. The eggs are done when the sheen disappears; stop cooking just before this happens.
# Transfer to a plate. Sprinkle grated cheese on top if desired.
# Season with black pepper (black pepper will burn and become bitter if seasoned before cooking)
Serves one.  Good as-is or with [[Cookbook:Ketchup|ketchup]] ([[Cookbook:Tomato Sauce|tomato sauce]]), [[Cookbook:Salsa|salsa]] and/or butter on [[Cookbook:Toast|toast]].

== Variations ==

* For a [[Cookbook:Low-sodium Cooking|low sodium]] version, omit salt and cheese and use unsalted butter.

* Sour cream may be used in place of milk for a creamier and richer version.

* Cook 1/3 cup of crumbled cooked meats (like [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]] or [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausage]]) or chopped vegetables (like [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]] or [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell pepper]]) for a couple of minutes before adding the egg mixture. See also [[Cookbook:Southwestern Scramble|Southwestern Scramble]].

== Fried Pita Bread with Eggs ==
* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
* 1 pita bread
* 2 eggs
* salt and black pepper
# In a heavy skillet heat the oil at medium low temperature
# Tear the pita into small pieces and add to the hot oil
# Cook, stirring frequently, until the bread is lightly browned and crispy.
# Add the eggs and scramble them with the bread.
# Season with salt and ground black pepper to taste and serve.

This recipe is fairly easy, serves 6 to 8 adults, and requires a minimum of 3 hours to prepare.

Midwestern chicken wings are not to be confused with hot wings; midwestern wings are not spicy.

==Ingredients==
*4 to 5 pounds of [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] wings
*2 cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
*1 tablespoon of fresh [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
*1 cup of [[Cookbook:Soy sauce|soy sauce]]
*12 ounces of [[Cookbook:Apricot|apricot]] preserves (not preserved apricots, not apricot jelly)

==Procedure==
#[[Cookbook:Mince|Mince]] garlic and ginger.
#Place all ingredients except chicken into a bowl and mix.
#[[Cookbook:Marinate|Marinate]] the chicken with the marinade. A plastic bag sealed tight without much air or free space is believed to provide the best marinating.
#Refrigerate at least 3 hours, but as with many marinating recipes, the longer the better.
#Clean then preheat grill at medium.
#Place wings on grill.
#Turn once, or four times, during next 20 minutes.

==Notes, Tips, And Variations==
*Cut the chicken wings into two pieces at the elbow joint (recommended).
*For the health conscious, remove the chicken skin (not recommended).
*Heat marinade on grill along with chicken wings, add a little to the wings when done.
*1 teaspoon of ginger powder can be substituted for the fresh ginger.
*Feel free to apply the marinade recipe to other chicken cuts, such as breasts. A shish-kabob variation of this recipe is also excellent.

==Warnings==
*Ensure a clean kitchen environment (hands, surfaces, etc) since this recipe requires marinating.
*As with all fish and poultry, [[Cookbook:Chicken#Foodborne_Organisms_Associated_with_Chicken|clean then rinse the chicken]].
*Never reuse a marinade without first heating it to a boil.

Red Devils are a hot, open faced sandwich. They are a great dinner or lunch.  They include all the major food groups and taste great.  Their ease of preparation makes them suitable for people on the move and the recipe can easily be scaled up or down for family or guests.

==Ingredients==
*[[Cookbook:Bread|Bread]], sliced
*[[Cookbook:Processed Cheese|American Cheese]], sliced
*[[Cookbook:Tomato|Tomato]], sliced
*[[Cookbook:Onion|Onion]], diced
*[[Cookbook:Bacon|Bacon]]

Makes 9-12 sandwiches depending on the size of the cookie sheet

==Procedure==
#Place bacon in a pan.
#Set the broiler to 'Low.'
#Pre-cook the bacon untill it is about halfway done.
#While bacon cooks, place white bread on a sheetpan, one slice per diner.
#Place a slice of american cheese on each slice of bread.
#Place the tomato slices on each sandwich
#Sprinkle a small amount of onion onto each sandwich.
#Place a strip of half cooked bacon on each sandwich.
#Place the cookie sheet in broiler and set to maximum temperature and broil for approximately 3-4 minutes.
#''You must check on The Red Devils often to prevent burning''.
#Remove once the bread is toasted, the cheese is golden at the edges, and the bacon is fully cooked.

==Tips, tricks, and variations==

Often times, it may be easier to eat with utensils instead of by hand.  This may not apply to bachelors.

The bacon is usually too long to fit on the sandwich so cut it in half.  One strip of bacon is usually used per sandwich so it will have 2 halves on it when finished.

Precooking the bacon may be accomplished while preparing the rest of the food.  It is best to cook until between rare and crisp.

Red devils usually require one tomato per sheetpan of sandwiches but may vary depending upon the size of your sheetpans or the size of your tomato slices.

A whole onion is not needed for a tray of Red Devils.  A small sprinkling of diced onions is sufficient. Sweet onions or red onions are a good substitution for normal white &quot;storage&quot; onions.

As always, you can always experiment or change things according to your tastes.

==Warnings==

''It is very important to check on the Red Devils once they are in the oven''.  They can quickly change from being undercooked to overcooked within a few seconds.  The goal is to quickly cook the bacon and toast the bread and cheese without making the sandwich too hot to eat soon after being finished.

==Ingredients==
*1 lb [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] (whatever part, suitable for grilling), thin sliced
*3 [[Cookbook:Green onion|green onions]], sliced in a bias
*4 button [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]], sliced
*1/2 [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], thinly sliced
*3/4 cup [[Cookbook:Soy sauce|soy sauce]]
*1/4 cup [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*4 tbsp [[Cookbook:Sesame oil|sesame oil]]
*4 tsp [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
*1-2 tbsp minced [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]

==Instructions==
#Slice the beef as thin as possible.
#Combine all the ingredients in a big bowl.
#Marinate beef and vegetables for at least 30 minutes.  Marinating overnight will get the best flavor and tenderization.
#Grill the beef.
#Serve with rice.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Use same amount of soy sauce and sugar.
*If you do this a day ahead, reduce the amount of soy sauce and don't forget to put it in a refrigerator.
*Use thinly-sliced beef, available specifically for Bulgogi in some grocery stores, for best results.
*You can grill this on a table top, with a shallow pan.
*Grill with medium high heat and have the juice of beef and vegetables on rice.
*You may marinate the beef in cola (Coca-Cola works best) instead of using just sugar.  The extra liquid helps the meat to absorb the marinade more quickly.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Korea|Korean Cuisine]]

'''Kimchi''', '''Kimchee''' or '''Gimchi''' (김치) is a Korean dish of pickled [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]], usually [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]] or Muwoo (white radish), and commonly served as a [[Cookbook:Side dishes|side dish]]. It is commonly fermented in a brine of [[Cookbook:Anchovy|anchovies]], [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]], [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], [[Cookbook:Green onion|green onion]] and [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chilli pepper]]. There are infinite varieties, at least as many as there are households. The following is a standard recipe for baechoo (napa cabbage) kimchi.

==Ingredients==
*1 head [[Cookbook:Nappa Cabbage|nappa cabbage]] (baechu, Chinese cabbage, wombok)
*½ [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], thin sliced
*¼ [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]], thin julienne
*¼ [[Cookbook:Radish|radish]], thin julienne
*4 [[Cookbook:Green onion|green onions]] (spring onions), cut into 2 inch pieces
*2 tbsp [[Cookbook:Mincing|minced]] [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
*1 tsp minced [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
*½ cup [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|go choo ga roo]] (Korean chili powder)
*2 tsp [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1 tbsp [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*½ cup sea salt (or any coarse salt)
*1 cup water
*¼ cup [[Cookbook:Fish Sauce|jeot gal]] (Korean fish sauce)

==Instructions==
#Quarter the nappa cabbage, wash and drain.
#Mix ½ cup sea salt (or any coarse salt) and 1 cup water.
#Put cabbages in a salted water and take out one at a time to get salt down.
#In a container, add cabbages and pour salted water, set aside for at least 6-8 hours. (Overnight will be great.)
#The cabbage should be soft enough to bend.
#Wash, drain well.
#Mix together ½ cup go choo ga roo (Korean chili powder), 2 tsp salt, 1 tbsp sugar, ¼ cup jeot gal (Korean fish sauce), 2 tbsp minced garlic, and 1 tsp minced ginger.
#Mix in vegetables to the chili powder mixture.
#Take one cabbage, stuff in above mixture to an every layer. Try to fold in half 
#With 2 outer leaves, wrap the whole thing securely.
#Put it in a air tight container.
#Let it sit on a kitchen counter for overnight.
#Put in a refrigerator for 2-3 days.
#Serve with rice.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*The brine can be varied to include many other ingredients.  Be creative.
*¼ cup jeot gal (Korean fish sauce) can be replaced with moderate amounts of raw butterfish or oysters.  Seafood can also be left out entirely although appropriate amount of salt needs to be added in place of missing jeot gal.  Alternative flavors can include asian pears or tangerines.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Pasta Recipes|Pasta Recipes]]

==Ingredients==
* a large handful of fresh [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]]
* 8-12 cloves of garlic (depending on your preference/size of meal)
* 4 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Olive oil|olive oil]]
* 100-200g feta cheese
* 200g pitted kalamata olives
* a small package of snap peas
* 1-2 breasts [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] (can substitute salmon or steak)
* approximately 500g linguine

==Procedure==
Lightly saute the garlic in a pan - this is not meant to completely cook it, but to take a little of the bite off of it. Chop the garlic up a bit in a food processor, then add the spinach bit by bit (stems may be left on if you like). When you have completed mixing the garlic and spinach together, add the olive oil and mix. Put into a bowl and set aside.

Strip the snap peas of the stringy bits and the hard ends and place those aside in a bowl as well.

Start the water on the stove at a medium temperature to prevent the water from boiling, but able to easily obtain a boil at your whim. Start the barbecue/grill and put the chicken (or other meat) on at a medium temperature. When it has heated up, put a bit of olive oil on each side to prevent sticking. When the meat is about a quarter done, you want to have the water boiling. Put the linguine in, and if you wish put a bit of olive oil in that as well for flavor and to prevent the pasta from sticking together.

While you are doing this, put the snap peas in a small fry pan with some olive oil at a low-medium temperature to warm them up a bit.

When the pasta and meat are cooked (try and get these finished cooking at the same time), slice the chicken into strips (in the case of the steak/salmon, it may be better to just leave it in fillet/steak form for presentation purposes). Strain the pasta, and put it in a fry pan along with some of the pesto (by portion) to heat the pesto up a bit. Make sure it is not at a high temperature, as that will cause the pasta to crisp up. When you have finished this, put it on a plate and top with feta and olives. Arrange the snap peas and meat strips on top as well, and there's your dinner!

Makes 3-5 portions.

== Variations ==
You may alter the pesto at will; it works equally well to either add sundried tomatoes to the spinach pesto, or, if you like, you could also just do a traditional basil pesto. Other variations on pesto include adding Romano or Parmigiano Reggiano (or other, softer Parmesan cheeses), or adding different kinds of nuts (pine nuts, almonds, etc) for a different taste to the pesto. In keeping with the tangy taste the kalamata olives bring to the pasta, sundried tomatoes really help enhance the flavor of the dish.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Cuisine of Italy]] | [[Cookbook:Rice|Rice]]

'''Risotto''' is an Italian rice dish, most popular in the north of Italy. Generally the rice is slowly cooked in stock, but other liquids can be used. What's described here is a basic risotto recipe. Grated or ground Parmesan cheese is almost always sprinkled on top. It can be eaten as is, but risotto is generally enjoyed with one or two ingredients added. In Italy, Risotto is like pasta usually served as first course, the second course being meat or fish.

==Ingredients==

* 400 g. risotto [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] (plump, medium grain rice that contains a lot of starch, the types Arborio, Carnaroli or Vialone Nano are traditionally best)
* 1 [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* 1 clove of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* 1 glass of dry white [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]]
* some [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], around 25 grams (a good rich butter is best)
* about a liter of [[Cookbook:Stock|stock]]/[[Cookbook:Broth|broth]], but it's a good idea to have more than you need (as the amount needed is difficult to predict). What type of stock depends on the flavour you're trying to achieve, but since the flavour of the stock will become the main flavour of the dish, good stock is a wise investment. Canned is better than cubes or powder, home-made is usually best. Make sure the stock isn't too strong or too salty, as it will be greatly condensed. Make sure the stock is clear too, or the texture of the risotto will become gritty (The article on stock contains information on clarifying stock).

==Preparation==

Make sure your stock is simmering before you begin. It's important that the temperature is as high as possible, without letting the stock boil. The surface of the stock should just be moving a little. 
A large thick pot is best for the risotto.

# Finely chop the onion and garlic and sweat them very gently (cook over medium heat, without letting them brown) in some butter (you can use olive oil, but butter is preferred). This is known as a ''[[Cookbook:Soffritto|soffritto]]'' in Italy.
# Add the rice and cook until it has a transparent look (this shouldn't take long). Add some salt and pepper.
# Add the wine. A hot pan will cause the alcohol to evaporate more quickly (and create a nice dramatic effect), but make sure you don't burn the rice or the soffritto.
# As the wine cooks away you will see the remaining liquid getting thicker as it's absorbing the starch from the rice. When its more or less gone, add some stock. Do not add too much stock, the rice should never be submerged in stock. Keep stirring it and keep adding more stock as it cooks away. This should take about 15 to 20 minutes.
# Taste to see if the rice is done. The rice should be soft, but have enough bite to it to feel the individual grains of rice. The choice between a liquid risotto or a firmer one is a matter of personal preference. 
When put on a plate, it should spread out slowly.  If it sits still, it needs some more stock; if there's liquid coming from the risotto, it needs to cook down a bit more.
# When it's done, stir in the butter in small chunks at the time, taste to get the amount of butter right. Season with more salt and pepper to taste. 
# Let it rest for a few minutes, and then serve. Risotto won't keep beyond the meal, but rehydrating it with some soup or stock can yield edible results.

With risotto, practice makes perfect because there are many factors that influence the outcome.  Experiment with several varieties of rice, choose the one you like best and then fine-tune the various parameters like cooking temperature, selection of the proper pot, the amount and timing of seasonings etc.

==Notes, tips and variations==

===Notes===

* This is only the most basic risotto recipe. Add ingredients only at the beginning (through the soffritto, when they need to cook with the rice) or at the very end (for ingredients that lose their flavour with too much cooking, such as [[Cookbook:Herb|herbs]]). If you want to use ingredients that require a very specific cooking time, like [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] or [[Cookbook:Broccoli|broccoli]], it's best to [[Cookbook Blanching|blanch]] them in advance, and add them to the risotto at the very end. It's very difficult to add them to the risotto halfway so that they will be cooked perfectly when the risotto is done. If you want the flavour of the stock to be present in these ingredients, blanch them in the stock. For some ingredients, like [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]], the cooking time isn't extremely important. These can simply be added to the risotto somewhere along the line.
* A common mistake in making risotto is to add too much of the extra ingredients. The star of the dish is the rice, and only very little else is needed.
* Ingredients added at the last moment will be laced with butter. This can have a negative impact on the effect of some delicate ingredients, like garden cress.

===Tips===

* Think of risotto as a way of making stock edible with a fork: the quality of the stock you use is the most important factor in the quality of your risotto.
* Use a different type of liquor to replace the white wine; vodka, whiskey, champagne and Martini work well. Keep in mind that the color of the liquor will affect the rice. Using [[Cookbook:Red Wine|red wine]] will create a red risotto (which looks nice with [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]] or [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]). [[Cookbook:Rosé|Rosé]] wine will make a pink/purple risotto, which looks nice with asparagus.
* Sprinkle a [[Cookbook:Vinaigrette|vinaigrette]] over the risotto just before serving.
* Use [[Cookbook:Cream Cheese|cream cheese]] instead of butter.
* [[Cookbook:Saffron|Saffron]] is often added to the stock.
* Using large roasted  breadcrumbs instead of Parmesan cheese will create a nice contrast in texture with the risotto. Put the breadcrumbs on top of the risotto at the last minute and don't stir, or they will soak up too much moisture and lose their crunch.
* After step 3 you can move the contents into a rice cooker with the stock and left to its own devices to finish it off. The end result isn't quite as good, but the saving in effort makes it worthwhile.
* Left over risotto is not particularly nice reheated on its own. So as not to waste the left overs, you can form day old risotto into cakes or patties, coat them in flour and shallow fry them in olive oil, making risotto cakes. This can be served with a salad.

===A ''very quick'' risotto===
When really pressed for time, the following procedure will produce a reasonable semblance of risotto within ten minutes:
*Place a pot over strong heat and pour in the stock to boil.  You will need twice as much stock as the rice to be cooked (e.g. two cups of stock for one cup of dry rice).  
*Place a second pot over strong heat and drop in some butter.
*Once the butter in the first pot has melted, pour in the rice and start sauteeing it, stirring continuously with a wooden spoon.  The butter will soon start to froth.  Extra seasonings can also be added at this point.
*By this time, the stock will have started boiling.  Pour it into the pot with the rice (caution: this produces hot steam suddenly, so ''do'' be careful!), stir well to make sure that no rice has stuck on the inside of the pot, cover the pot and switch off the heat.
*Leave alone for five to seven minutes, then serve.

===Variations===

* [[Cookbook:Mushroom|Mushroom]] risotto. Add mushrooms to the soffritto.
* [[Cookbook:Cashew|Cashew]] nut and [[Cookbook:Cucumber|cucumber]] risotto. Add chopped cucumber and roasted (unsalted) cashew nuts.
* [[Cookbook:Feta Cheese|Feta cheese]] and [[Cookbook:Rosemary|rosemary]] risotto. Add the rosemary to the soffritto and stir small chunks of the feta cheese through the risotto at the end. Use roasted breadcrumbs instead of Parmesan cheese.
* [[Cookbook:Paella|Paella]] is similar to a risotto, but uses a very different cooking method.
* Add sliced [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]], sliced sun-dried tomatoes and shredded [[Cookbook:Pepperoni|pepperoni]] before adding the wine.  Add tin of [[Cookbook:Asparagus|asparagus]] just before it finishes, or fresh asparagus stalks just before the wine.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|French Cuisine]] | [[Cookbook:Soup|Soup]]

French '''onion soup''' is a classic French soup. It's lightly bound with a little flour. 

==Ingredients==
For the soup:
* 4 large [[Cookbook:onion|onions]]
* 1 liter of beef [[Cookbook:Stock|stock]] (use vegetable stock to make a vegetarian soup)
* 1 tbsp of [[Cookbook:flour|flour]]
* [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]

For the [[Cookbook:Crouton|Croutons]]:
* 4 slices of [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]
* 1 clove of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* [[Cookbook:Olive oil|olive oil]] and butter

==Procedure==

The soup:

# Slice the onions into rings and sauté them gently in the butter (don't use olive oil for this). Don't rush this, let the onions brown very gently. If some brown bits appear on the bottom of your pan, don't worry, these are the sugars from the onions that have caramelized. They'll dissolve when you add the stock.
# Add the flour and stir. The flour will seem to have disappeared, but has been absorbed into the butter. This will give the soup its characteristic slight thickness.
# Add a quarter of the stock and stir for a while. Add another quarter of the stock and keep stirring. Repeat for the remaining stock.

The croutons:

# Crush and chop the garlic. Put the olive oil and butter into the pan and lightly sauté the garlic.
# Increase the heat a little and fry the slices of bread until golden.

Serve the soup with the croutons floating in it.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
* Described here is only one way to make the croutons.
* Onion soup is often eaten with grated cheese ([[Cookbook:Gruyère|Gruyère]], classicaly). It can be sprinkled over oven-baked croutons or sprinkled over the soup when the croutons are already baked.

== Making jams and jellies ==

A jam is a fruit conserve in which sugar and fruit chunks are boiled together. In a jelly, the juice is pressed or boiled out of the fruit, filtered and then boiled again with sugar to reduce and thicken it. It is important to keep in mind that some fruits are better for making jellies and others are better used in jams.  Generally speaking, it's easier to make a jam than it is to make a jelly.

== Recipe for Jam ==

Ingredients:
*a good quanity of soft, fleshy fruit like strawberries, peaches, cherries, plums, blueberries, brambles
*sugar or sugar with added [[Cookbook:pectin|pectin]]
*lemon juice 

Instructions:
Clean the fruit, remove any stones, leaves or other incomestible parts, and wash it. If the fruit is not a small berry, then cut it up into small pieces. Weigh the fruit and add the same weight of sugar to it. If you are using a very juicy fruit, you may prefer to use sugar with added pectin. Pectin is naturally present in most fruits and will cause the jam to &quot;set&quot;, but some fruits contain less pectin and some contain more, so it is often helpful to add some. 

Sprinkle the fruit and sugar with lemon juice and stir well. Then cover the container and let the mixture rest for at least one hour in a clean, cool place to let the fruit absorb the sugar. After this, pour the mixture into a sufficiently large cooking pot. Traditionally a copper pot is used, but any other cooking pot will do fine. Bring the mixture slowly to the boil on a low fire, stirring fregularly. Depending on the fruit, you will need to boil the mixture for about an hour. The jam is ready when it is thick enough. Check this by pouring a drop of the jam onto a cold plate. It should turn sticky and not be too runny.

To preserve the jam well, you should pour it into glass flasks or containers that have been sterilized by boiling them in water. You can also pasteurize the containers by washing them with boiling water. The inside of lids as well as the flasks should be washed if the latter method is used. The jam should be poured rapidly into the still-hot containers. The containers should be sealed with lids. In this case it's best to let the air bubble that is in the flask traverse the still-hot jam by turning it upside-down after the lid has been placed on. This is to disinfect the air bubble. Or, instead of a lid, the jam can be protected by pouring molten parrafin on top of it, and closing of the jar with a paper that is held with a rubber band.

Serve with [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]], [[Cookbook:Toast|toast]], [[Cookbook:English Muffin|English muffins]], or [[Cookbook:Pancake|pancakes]].

'''Eggplant Pasta''' – This tasty vegetable stew is great served with your favorite pasta.

==Ingredients==
*1 [[Cookbook:Eggplant|eggplant]] (aubergine)
*1 large [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbs]] [[Cookbook:Olive_Oil|olive oil]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste
*2 tins of peeled [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili pepper]]
*handfuls of fresh [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]]
*dried [[Cookbook:Cuisine_of_Italy|Italian]] [[Cookbook:Herb|herbs]] ([[Cookbook:Marjoram|marjoram]], [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]], [[Cookbook:Capsicum|capsicum]], [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]], [[Cookbook:Rosemary|rosemary]], [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]], [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]]) - often sold pre-mixed.
*fresh [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], crushed
*[[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]] (your favourite)

Serves 4.

==Procedure==
#Slice eggplant and cover in salt. Leave for at least 30 minutes.
#Rinse salt away, then squeeze until almost dry (this removes sourness).
#Cut into chip-sized pieces and [[Cookbook:Frying|fry]] in oil.
#Add onion and cook briefly.
#Add all other ingredients and [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]] for 30 minutes.
#Serve with freshly cooked pasta.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*The amounts of the various ingredients are not really important. Experiment and adjust to taste.
*It is often better to prepare the vegetables the night before as this gives time for the flavours of the chili pepper, garlic, and herbs to diffuse through the mix.
*Spiral pasta is a good choice as it holds the sauce to itself.

==Warnings==
*Always wash your hands after handling chili peppers. Be especially careful not to touch your eyes.

#Select shoulder parts of the veal and cut them into 1&quot; cubes. Wash the meat thoroughly with cold water, drain, and place in a pot together with butter and onions. Stir-fry for a few minutes. 
#As the meat is frying, add water until the pieces are covered. Add salt, pepper, and only two to three tablespoons of tomatoes (note: tomatoes can be cut into pieces to the size of your choice). Cover the pot and let the meat boil.
#In the meantime, cut the ends off the lima beans and clean them well (you also cut them in half if you desire). Add the beans to the meat after it has been boiling for several minutes. Also add water until everything in the pot is covered. 
#When the beans are done boiling, add the rest of the tomatoes. Then let the stew boil for a few more minutes so that the liquid can thicken.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Please note that tomatoes should not be added all at once in the beginning since they donít allow the lima beans to boil at the right pace. If you would rather use fresh tomatoes, when you add the beans, add whole tomatoes instead of cut ones.

A simple [[Cookbook:Pizza|pizza]] recipe; works well for thin crusts.

===Ingredients===

* warm water. ''about 100 degrees (38.00 C). try one [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] per pizza. If the batter is thin and runny like [[Cookbook:Pancake|pancake]] batter, that's too much water, so add a little [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] to thicken it.  If you can touch the batter with your finger and not stick to it, that's too dry, so add a little water''
* [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] ''about 2 cups per pizza.'' ''Note that it must be at least 60%-70% white flour.  It would be heavy and wouldn't rise as much if you get too much [[Cookbook:Whole Wheat|whole wheat]] and [[Cookbook:Cornmeal|cornmeal]] in the batter.''
* [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]]. ''a 1/4 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] package in the grocery store makes about 2 12&quot; pizzas.''
* [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]. ''you need very little for the yeast, but about 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] per pizza tastes good,''
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]. ''very little; a few shakes from the saltshaker is enough for 1 pizza.''

* [[Cookbook:Vegetable Oil|vegetable]], [[Cookbook:Corn Oil|corn]], or [[Cookbook:Canola Oil|canola oil]]. ''about .1 to .2 cup per pizza.''

A few more ingredients in the batter make it interesting:
* [[Cookbook:Cornmeal|cornmeal]]
* [[Cookbook:Sesame Seed|sesame seeds]]
* [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]] and [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]] spices.

===Procedure===
#Mix water, yeast, flour, and salt in a large mixing bowl. The dough rises to become about 50% larger, so use a big bowl. Set the mixing bowl so it is sitting in hot water, or place on top of a warm oven. Let rise for 20-30 minutes. Don't worry if it only rose 10% or 20%, it'll still work.
#Put vegetable oil on the pans, then sprinkle cornmeal on the oil. Put a glop of the batter on each pan and spead it so it is about .25 inch thick, with the edge .5 inch. Sprinkle flour on top of the dough so it doesn't stick to your hands.   
#Add pizza sauce, cheese, and toppings (optional, see [[Cookbook:Pizza|pizza]] article)
#Bake at [[Cookbook:Oven temperatures|425°F]] for about 15 to 20 minutes. Rotate every 5 minutes and move to upper or lower shelves as necessary: After 10 minutes slide a large knife under the crust. If it is dark brown, move it to a higher shelf so it doesn't burn while the top finishes coooking. If it is white or light tan, move to lower shelf so you get a crispy crust before the cheese starts turning brown on top.

On your first try,  try just one or two pizzas.  Then you can adjust it 
next time as necessary.

==Problems==
If:
; the crust isn't done in the middle : You have it too thick.
; the crust burned on the bottom : Either you had it too close to the bottom (use 2nd shelf, not lowest),  or didn't move it to a higher shelf in time. Some stoves are hotter than the thermostat, so try 400 next time.
; the crust is soggy : Water from fresh tomatoes, pineapples, and onions, can seep into the crust, so take it easy on those.
; pizza is too greasy :  Reduce oil in batter. Oil on pan needs to be film covering the pan so it doesn't burn, but it doesn't need to pool on the surface.   Some toppings (pepperoni, sausage, even cheese) will melt grease into the pizzas; try smaller pieces.  
; vegetables are overdone (e.g. dried up mushrooms, bitter peppers, soggy onion) : Vegetables don't need 20 minutes. Put them on halfway through so they still have a little texture left. Some vegetables, especially broccoli, work better when protected by a coating of oil.
; cheese is brown and dried out on top : Pizza was cooked too close to top element in oven; never use top shelf.
; crust is not very light : Use less whole wheat flour or cornmeal in the batter.  Use more yeast.

[[Image:Milkshake.jpg|thumb|A chocolate Milkshake]]

'''Milkshakes''' are beverages made by blending  cream and milk with other ingredients added for color and flavor.

== Classic Vanilla Milkshake ==

=== Ingredients ===

* 2 cups (480ml) vanilla [[Cookbook:Vanilla Ice Cream|ice cream]]
* 1 cup (240ml) [[Cookbook:Milk|whole milk]]
* 1/4 cup (60ml) [[Cookbook:Half &amp; half|half &amp; half]]
* 2 1/2 tablespoons (35g) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1/8 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Vanilla extract|vanilla extract]]

=== Procedure ===

Pour the milk, ice cream, and half &amp; half in a blender and partially blend, then add the sugar and flavoring until thoroughly mixed.

Serves: 3

== Oreo Milkshake ==

=== Ingredients ===

* vanilla ice cream
* milk
* about 6-8 Oreo cookies

=== Procedure ===

Put a few scoops of ice cream in a blender. Blend with enough milk to make the mixture thick, but fairly liquid. Add the remaining ingredients and blend.

Serves: 4

== Banana Milkshake ==

===Ingredients===

*1 large or 2 small bananas
*vanilla ice cream
*milk
*sugar

===Procedure===

Blend the banana, ice cream and sugar, add milk until you find your desired consistency, and blend again till smooth and creamy.

An optional but tasty addition is to add a pinch of cinnamon as well.

== Super Foamy ==

The ''Super Foamy'' is a highly [[:w:viscosity|viscous]] milkshake with a smooth, airy texture. It is [[:w:low-fat|low-fat]] and, for a shake, [[:w:High fiber|high-fiber]]. Best of it all, due to its thickness it's easy to [[:w:Satiety|eat one's fill]] on a single portion. With the prototype recipe provided here, variations can be made by adding different flavors such as vanilla, banana or strawberry.

===Prototype ingredients===
*1 teaspoon [[:w:Locust bean gum|locust bean gum]] powder (2 grams)
*1 tablespoon [[:w:Inulin|inulin]] powder (10 grams)
*2 tablespoons sweet [[Cookbook:Whey|whey]] powder (10 grams)
*200 ml [[Cookbook:Milk|skimmed milk]] (0.1 % fat)

===Procedure===
*Mix the locust bean gum powder, inulin powder and the sweet whey powder together. 
*Add the resulting powder to the skimmed milk.
*Using an [[Cookbook:Mixer|electric mixer]], whip for 2 minutes until the product has turned to a fine foam. While whipping, move the whisks up and down so that air gets whipped under the shake. 

===Different tastes===
*Add the syrup or flavor of your desire.
*When using [[Cookbook:Cocoa Powder|cocoa powder]] for creating a chocolate milkshake, do not use the mixer to spread the flavor but use a spoon instead. The fat in the powder could cause the foam to collapse. 
*[[Cookbook:Sweeteners|Artificial sugar substitutes]] are best for giving the shake a sweet taste.

===Notes===
*One serving equals approximately 700 ml in volume and 104 kcal in energy.
*The locust bean gum acts as the [[Cookbook:Thickener|thickening agent]].
*The inulin gives the shake a smooth, &quot;mouthful&quot; texture.
*Any sources of fat must be excluded for the foam to build up. Therefore, the milk must be very low fat.
*''[[Cookbook:Whey|Whey drink powders]]'' are readily available on the market. They contain around 95 % sweet whey powder with flavor and sweeteners added. They can be used to substitute the pure sweet whey powder.
*The sweet whey powder (along with the milk) acts as the component producing the [[:w:Foam|foam]]. Instead of the sweet whey powder you can use a fresh [[Cookbook:Egg White|egg white]] from a medium sized egg.

== Chocolate Shake==

===Ingredients===

*3 cups vanilla ice cream
*1 cup chocolate milk
*3 heaping tablespoons chocolate powder

*2 medium sized chocolates

===Procedure===

Pour all ingredients into the blender and blend until well mixed. Ice cream and chocolate milk can be added to change the consistency. Crushed Oreo cookies can be added after blending if desired.

== Ingredients ==
* 500 grams [[Cookbook:pasta|pasta]] (ideally penne)
* 3 generous tablespoons of olive oil
* 2 large garlic cloves, chopped 
* 1 onion, sliced (ideally, a red onion)
* 3/4 cup [[Cookbook:Pecan|pecan]] halves
* 1 package of frozen [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]], or, better, a moderate amount of fresh spinach.  If frozen spinach is used, consider steaming it quickly before using it in this recipe.
* crushed red pepper flakes to taste
* salt to taste
* OPTIONAL: feta or feta substitute

== Procedure ==

# Boil the pasta (Bring a pan of water to a boil.  Once it has a good rolling boil, put in the pasta.  Start checking it about 2 minutes before the amount of time specified on the package by tasting a piece.  A commonly held ideal for pasta is that it should be &quot;al dente&quot;, which means a tiny, tiny bit undercooked, rather than soft and mushy; it does not mean raw.  Drain the pasta once it's done.)
# Simultaneously, make the sauce.
# In a cold skillet, combine the olive oil, red pepper flakes, and garlic.  Put them on medium heat.
# After a brief amount of time, add the onion slices.
# Once the onion is slightly browned, add the pecan halves and saute them for two minutes.
# Add the spinach.  
# Once the spinach is done, add salt.
# The original recipe contained 1 cup of feta.  I've never tried it that way, but if you're adventerous, you could consider adding a feta substitute; if you do, mix it in at the end.
# Put the sauce on the drained pasta and serve.  

This recipe can be a stand-alone meal; it's also good cold as a leftover.  It sometimes turns out a bit dry.

Artichoke hearts are readily available in cans and jars in many countries, and are increasingly used in the making of snack dips. Many national chain restaurants in the USA have some variety of artichoke dip, which is usually mayonnaise-based. One of the easiest, yet unhealthy, variations on the creamy artichoke dip is jokingly called the '''Artichoke Hearts Attack''', owing to the amount of mayonnaise and Parmesan cheese it contains.

As an &quot;equal parts&quot; recipe, (with 3 simple parts), it is especially amenable to whipping up at the last minute for a party, and as it is primarily a base to which other ingredients are added, it is popular among those who like to add something distinctive.

==Ingredients==

Equal parts:
* [[Cookbook:Artichoke|artichoke]] hearts, chopped or squeezed
* [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]]
* [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan]] or [[Cookbook:Pecorino Romano Cheese|Romano cheese]]

==Procedure==

Just mix them up, that's it. 

==Notes, tips, and variations==

There are many who increase the amount of artichokes used, for health-conscious reasons. There are also versions that replace the mayonnaise with soft tofu.

Various items that are often added to the base artichoke dip, (to taste):

* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* chopped [[Cookbook:Green onion|scallions]], ([[Cookbook:Green onion|green onions]])
* [[Cookbook:Dill|dill]] weed
* finely chopped [[Cookbook:Olive|olives]], (often with pimento)
* chopped [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]] are an especially common addition
* any number of very finely chopped [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]], sometimes pre-cooked but raw is fine
* chopped [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]], cooked
*½ cup [[Cookbook:Sour Cream|sour cream]]
*½ cup [[Cookbook:Cream Cheese|cream cheese]]
*minced [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
*small can chopped green [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chilis]]
* [[Cookbook:Dijon Mustard|Dijon mustard]] (teaspoon or tablespoon to taste)

==Serving==

At room temperature, it is perfect for the savory dipping of vegetables, potato chips, and all other common party snacks. It becomes even better, however, as a warmed-up dip. Simply place it into a small, shallow, heat-resistant dish and broil it for just a little while, until the top turns slightly tan. It can also work well as a continuously warmed dip in a fondue pot, although it does need to be stirred every once in a while to prevent burning.

Another interesting use, for those who are definitely not counting calories, is as the base for a sandwich. Spread the dip onto a good Italian roll, then broil it. When the dip turns a nice tan color, take it out of the broiler and finish the sandwich with lettuce and tomato.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisines|Cuisines]] | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Cuisine of Japan]]

== Introduction to onigiri ==

Onigiri (also called omusubi) is a ball or triangle of cold [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]], often with a filling, frequently wrapped in [[Cookbook:Nori|nori]] making it easier to eat. It is a popular snack food, and is also common as part of a packed lunch. Depending on your location, some convenience store chains have shelves with a large selection of fresh onigiri for sale.

The most common form of onigiri has a filling in the center. This is often something sour or salty, as it helps preserve the rice for longer periods of time. Common fillings include [[Cookbook:Umeboshi|umeboshi]] (Japanese pickled plum); [[Cookbook:Katsuobushi|katsuobushi]] (dried bonito flakes) moistened in [[Cookbook:Soy sauce|soy sauce]]; cooked, salted [[Cookbook:Salmon|salmon]]; salmon [[Cookbook:Roe|roe]]; and &quot;seachicken&quot; (canned [[Cookbook:Tuna|tuna]]) with [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]]. Less common is onigiri with the filling mixed in with the rice, making it spread throughout the rice. 

A related dish is [[Cookbook:Yaki-onigiri|Yaki-onigiri]], which is a plain onigiri without filling that has been brushed with soy sauce or [[Cookbook:Barbecue sauce|barbecue sauce]] and grilled. This is a common side dish in pubs. A creative variation is a yaki-onigiri in a bowl of [[Cookbook:Dashi|dashi]] garnished with chopped [[Cookbook:Leek|leek]] and katsuobushi.

Fillings for onigiri are only limited to your imagination.  One point to remember is to choose fillings that are not overly hard/crunchy.  If they are reasonably hard they become quite difficult to eat.  Western fillings that can be quite delicious include such things as corned meats, avocado, even olives or semidried tomatoes.  A recommendation is to use fillings with a lot of flavour as it can be very bland and to cut them to small pieces.

== Making onigiri ==

Difficulty: Incredibly easy.  If you can boil rice and handle a little heat in the fingers, you can make onigiri.

Time: About 45 minutes.  Most of this time is taken in prep work (ie cooking and cooling of rice)

First, you need to use Japanese-style short grain rice; if the rice isn't sticky, there is obviously little chance of the onigiri staying together. Cook it in the usual way (using the instructions that are on the packet or included with the rice cooker). A rice cooker is recommended since it will be far more 'hands off' and will also free up more time to prepare the fillings.  Estimate that one deciliter (1/2 cup) of uncooked rice will become about two larger onigiri or three smaller ones.  While the rice is cooking, prepare the fillings. As you can see in the list above, there is wide latitude on what you can use as a filling. A few easy examples:

Umeboshi: estimate one-two [[Cookbook:Plum|plums]] per onigiri. Squeeze out the stone, and you're done!

[[Cookbook:Bonito Flakes|Katsuobushi]] (Bonito Flakes): take a deciliter or so of the flakes, and pour a ''little'' soy sauce over it - it is very easy to pour too much, so be careful. Mix the flakes and the soy sauce until the flakes are moistened.

Seachicken: take a can of tuna. Mix with a little mayonnaise - again, be sure you don't make it too wet. Add seasoning to taste; this can be chopped leeks, soy sauce, or [[Cookbook:Pepper|chilies]]; sour or salty flavours work well.

When the rice is done and has allowed to sit for a while, but not too long, it needs to be hot - it is time to make the rice balls. It is a good idea to have a moderately large, clear workspace that is easy to clean afterwards. The rice is sticky, and you will end up getting it everywhere in the area. You need a bowl with salt water to rinse your fingers - the rice is ''sticky''; also, the salty water enhances the flavour of the onigiri. Lastly, you will probably want to have some sheets of nori, though if you can't find it or don't like it, you can certainly do without.  There are two options listed that can be used to make these items:

Option 1 is to wet your hands in the salt water. Take two large spoonfuls of rice into one hand (carefully; the rice is hot), and gently squeeze and flatten it with the other. Make an indentation in the middle, and put some of the filling into the center. Be a little careful to get the filling only in the center and not all over the ball; that can make the rice less sticky, and stickiness is good. 

&quot;Fold&quot; the rice over the filling so it becomes covered. Squeeze gently, and mold it into a triangular shape by folding both your hands along the palms while keeping the fingers straight. Squeeze like that, rotating the ball a few times, and you will soon have a very neat triangle - this really is much harder to explain than to do. Once the ball is done, put it down on a clean surface to cool down. Rinse your hands and repeat.

Option 2 is to use a bowl and some plastic film (saran wrap/cling wrap).  Place about 2/3rds of the mixture into the centre of the cling wrap that has been draped into the bowl loosely.  Then add approximately 2 teaspoons of filling (this is working off of about 3-4 portions per cup of rice.  Then place the last 1/3 of the rice to the top.  Then, mould the onigiri within the cling wrap.  This drastically reduces mess and also is slightly more 'kid friendly'.

Once the balls are reasonably cool, you need to protect them from drying out. The easiest way is to wrap them in cling wrap, or put them into an airtight plastic food container. When it is time to eat, take one rice ball, wrap it in a piece of nori, and eat away. If you don't mind soggy nori, you can wrap the balls in nori beforehand.

'''Pasta marinata''' (Italian for &quot;marinaded dough&quot;) is a batter used when frying food.

==Ingredients==
*2 ounces Semolina [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]] (separated)
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] to taste
*2 ounces melted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] (or [[Cookbook:Olive oil|olive oil]]),
*about 8 ounces [[Cookbook:Water|water]]

==Procedure==
#Mix the following ingredients well together: semolina flour, the yolks of two eggs, a little salt, and melted butter.  
#Add the water so as to form a liquid substance.  
#At the last add the whites of two eggs beaten up to a snow.  

This will make a good paste for masking meat, fish, vegetables, or sweets which are to be fried in the Italian manner, but if for meat or vegetables add a few drops of [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]] or a little [[Cookbook:Lemon juice|lemon juice]].

This is a simple recipe for scrambled eggs.

'''Approximate Cooking Time:''' 5-10 minutes

==Ingredients==
*[[Cookbook:Egg|Eggs]]
*[[Cookbook:Butter|Butter]], [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]], [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] or [[Cookbook:Cooking Spray|cooking spray]] (enough to coat pan)
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste

The additional ingredient possibilities are virtually limitless.  It is common to add a small amount of [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]], [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] or [[Cookbook:Water|water]] (apprx 1/2 teaspoon per egg) to the egg mixture before cooking (will make eggs fluffier).  [[Cookbook:Cheese|Cheese]] is also popular, and should be added near the end of cooking.  Other ingredients to try include: [[Cookbook:Ham|ham]], [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]], [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|peppers]], [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausage]], [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], [[Cookbook:Olive|olives]], [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]], shaved [[Cookbook:Truffle|truffles]], smoked [[Cookbook:Turkey|turkey]], [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]], [[Cookbook:Broccoli|brocoli]], [[Cookbook:Tarragon|tarragon]], [[Cookbook:Chive|chives]], [[Cookbook:Parsely|parsely]] and [[Cookbook:Asparagus|asparagus]]. [[Cookbook:Dijon Mustard|Dijon mustard]] is also good mixed into the egg mixture prior to cooking.

==Procedure 1==
# Heat pan (a non-stick or well seasoned cast iron is preferable) to medium and add enough butter, oil, or cooking spray to coat bottom
# Crack desired number of eggs into a bowl.
# Add milk or water to eggs, if desired (apprx. 1/2 teaspoon per egg)
# Season with salt and pepper to taste (other herbs and spices may be used as well)
# Beat eggs gently with fork or whisk for 15-20 seconds.  It is not neccessary to make a completely uniform mixture.
# Add egg mixture to heated, greased pan.
# With a spatuala or spoon (avoid metal tools if using teflon pan) continuously gently scrape cooked egg from pan.  The length of time and the frequency with which you scrape will determine the consistency of the eggs and is a matter of personal preference. The time will vary from 30 seconds to 3 or more minutes depending on number and type of eggs, size and heat of pan, and personal preference.

==Procedure 1b - Microwave==

To cook in microwave, grease bowl before cracking one to two eggs into bowl.  Mix gently.  Microwave on high for 40 seconds to 2 minutes.  Actual cooking time will vary.  A general rule of thumb is to watch eggs for entire time and stop microwave when entire mixture has risen somewhat.  If it explodes, you waited too long.  Egg(s) will come out in shape of the bowl; depending on the size of the bowl, this method is very useful for making an appropriate size egg patty for a sandwhich.

==Procedure 2==
# Heat a non-stick pan w/ the bottom covered in Canola Oil to Med. settings.
# Crack eggs and place inside pan.
# Immediately begin mixing while lightly sprinkling salt for 5 seconds.
# Continue mixing until eggs are thoroughly scrambled and mixed.
# Turn off heat and wait 1 minute for eggs to cool.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Slovenia|Cuisine of Slovenia]]

'''Prekmurska Gibanica''' is a cake similar to [[Cookbook:Strudel|Strudel]], with poppy seeds, curd cheese, walnuts and apples. It is a national speciality of Slovenia.

==Ingredients==

*A fireproof earthenware baking mould (preferably round, diameter 32 to 35 cm, height 7 to 9 cm).
*To pour on: 70 cl sour cream and 2 eggs or 3 egg yolks, mixed well
*To sprinkle on: 250 g butter 
 
===Strudel dough===
*500 g flour
*40 g sunflower seed oil
*20 to 30 cl lukewarm water
*salt

===Short pastry dough (base)=== 
*150 g flour
*100 g fat (butter or margarine)
*1 egg yolk, 50 g icing sugar
*1 pack of vanilla sugar

===Walnut filling===
*250 g ground walnuts
*80 g sugar, some cinnamon
*grated lemon peel

===Curd cheese filling=== 
*1000 g full-fat curd cheese
*1 egg
*80 g raisins
*100 g sugar
*salt
*1 pack vanilla sugar

===Poppy seed filling===
*150 g ground poppy seeds
*80 g sugar
*some cinnamon
*grated lemon peel

===Apple filling===
*1 kg apples
*100 g sugar
*some cinnamon 

==Procedure==
===Strudel dough===
#Sift the flour onto a working surface, make a well in the middle, add a pinch of salt, oil and water, mix everything together and knead for about 10 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. 
#Shape the dough into a ball, coat with oil, cover and leave to rest for 30 minutes on a floured board.
===Short pastry dough=== 
#Sift the flour onto a working surface, press a well in the middle, add knobs of butter, sugar, egg yolk and vanilla sugar, and knead together quickly. 

===Walnut filling===
#Thoroughly mix ground walnuts, sugar, vanilla sugar and cinnamon. 

===Curd cheese filling===
#Mash the curd cheese, thoroughly mix the egg, vanilla sugar, sugar, some salt and grated lemon peel until the filling spreads nicely. 
#Add washed raisins that have been softened in rum.

===Poppy seed filling===
#Thoroughly mix ground poppy seeds, sugar, vanilla sugar, cinnamon and grated lemon peel.

===Apple filling=== 
#Peel the apples, slice them and mix them with sugar and cinnamon. 

==Preparation==

#Grease the baking mould well, roll out the short pastry dough and line the base of the baking mould with it, then prick it gently with a fork. 
#Stretch the strudel dough and coat it with oil. 
#Pull it thinly over the baking mould so that the thick edges hang down over the mould. Cut off the edges to make 8 equal-sized sheets of strudel dough. 
#Place the first sheet of strudel dough on the short pastry dough, coat with poppy seed filling and sprinkle with butter and the sour cream mixture. 
#Then place the second sheet of strudel pastry on top, coat with curd cheese filling and sprinkle with butter and the sour cream mixture. 
#Cover with the next sheet of strudel dough, coat with walnut filling and again sprinkle with butter and the sour cream mixture. 
#Coat the fourth sheet of strudel dough with the apple filling and sprinkle with butter and the sour cream mixture. The Gibanica is now half-assembled. 
#Repeat steps 4 through 7 until you end up with 8 uniform layers. 
#Finally, cover with a sheet of strudel dough and pull it over the edge of the baking mould, then sprinkle with butter and cream. 
#Prick the Gibanica with a long needle again. Bake in a pre-heated oven or bread oven at 175°C for about 75 minutes. 
#Coat with sour cream and allow it to cool a little
#Cut into triangles, sprinkle with icing sugar and serve. 

== Notes, tips and variations ==
* You can also assemble the individual layers of the Prekmurska Gibanica in a different order. The only important point is that moist (curd cheese, apple) and drier (poppy seed, walnut) fillings should alternate.

Holland tea cakes are simple flat cookies. They are easy and quick to make. They are traditionally 
Chistmas cookies but are good for any time. They last for a long time so if you make too many they can be saved.

==Ingredients==
*1 cup (240g) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]				
*1 stick [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] (preferably melted)
*2 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]] (separated)
*2 cups (280g) [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]				
*1-2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]] (more or less to taste)
* Colored sugar or nuts for topping
	
==Procedure==

#Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). 
#Mix the butter and sugar until completely mixed. Add egg yolk and mix some more. Add flour and cinnamon and mix thoroughly preferably by hand (though this all can be done in a mixer if you insist).
#Pour batter into a cookie pan, spread over the whole pan use the palm of your hand to smooth the batter (this is the hardest part), and brush on leftover egg white. Add whatever toppings you want spread evenly across the batter (see below).  
#Put cookie sheet in oven until cookies are golden brown (about 20 minutes). Remove, and let cool. Before they get too cool, cut them into small squares about 1 in by 1 in (2.5cm x 2.5cm).

==Notes, tips, and variations==
Egg substitutes can be used in place of the egg yolk, but you still need egg white for the topping.

==Ingredients==
*6 [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], peeled and diced
*3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*1 large [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]], diced
*1/4 cup [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]

*1 tbsp dried [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]]
*1/4 tsp dried [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]]
==Procedure==
#Cook onion in butter until tender
#Bring the diced potatoes, carrots, water and chicken bouillon in another stock pot to a boil. Simmer about 10 minutes or until tender. Add ground black pepper.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Dessert|Desserts]] | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian Cuisine]]

'''Tiramisù''' means &quot;pull me up&quot; and aptly describes the Italian dessert made from [[Cookbook:Lady Fingers|ladyfingers]], espresso coffee, mascarpone cheese, egg whites, sugar, and often marsala wine. The biscuits are sprinkled with strong coffee and the marsala, and then embedded in a thick rich custard. Sometimes chocolate is also used, but that is not traditional.

== Ingredients ==

* 4 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] whites
* 2 egg yolks
* 100 [[Cookbook:g|g]] (1/2 [[Cookbook:cup|cup)]] of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] (alter to your own preference)
* 500 [[Cookbook:g|g]] (2 1/2 [[Cookbook:cup|cups)]] of [[Cookbook:Mascarpone|mascarpone cheese]]
* [[Cookbook:Espresso|espresso]]
* [[w:Marsala wine|marsala wine]] (or brandy or [[w:Cognac (drink)|cognac]])
* [[Cookbook:Lady Fingers|lady fingers]] (sponge cake fingers)
* dark [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]] powder

== Procedure ==

# Make espresso, sweeten, and add the marsala wine (or cognac) to it. 
# Beat sugar into the egg yolks.
# Beat the sweetened mascarpone into the sweetened yolks.
# Whisk whites of 4 eggs until they form stiff peaks.
# Fold egg whites into mascarpone mixture.
# Quickly dip both sides of the ladyfingers in the espresso mixture.
# Layer soaked ladyfingers and mascarpone in a large bowl or pan (start with fingers, finish with mascarpone).
# Sprinkle dark chocolate powder on top.
# Refrigerate for one hour.

== Notes, tips, and variations ==

* [[Cookbook:Savoiardi|Savoiardi]] are the traditional biscuits used with this recipe, rather than [[Cookbook:Lady Fingers|ladyfingers]]
* Cream can be used as an alternative to thicken the tiramisu. Whisk 3/4 pint to 1 pint of double cream until stiff peaks form, then add the sugar and continue from step 2.
* Full-fat spread cheese can be used as an alternative to mascarpone; add some cream to taste.
* There is also an [[Cookbook:Atkins-friendly Tira Misu|Atkins friendly recipe]].

== Warnings ==

*In this recipe the term &quot;ladyfingers&quot; refers to a kind of biscuit or cake, NOT to [[Cookbook:Okra|okra]], which would be an ''interesting'' variation.
*Whether thickening with egg whites or cream, ensure it is stiff before adding to the other ingredients; if it is not stiff, the tiramisu will not set properly.

'''Butter tarts (Tart au Sucre)''' are an extremely common dessert in Canada, especially Ontario.  Many versions are made, some are gooey while some are not, and different nuts, fruits, and other fillings can be used.  Similar tarts can be found in the culinary traditions of [[Cookbook:Scottish cuisine|Scotland]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|France]]. This recipe (both the tarts and the pie crust) is a traditional family recipe from rural Western Ontario, dating from the turn of the last century. Original, copyrighted version at http://www.boutell.com/vegetarian/butter-tarts.html

==Ingredients==
===Pie Crust===
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]]
* 1 large teaspoon [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
* 3/4 cup boiling water
* 3 1/2 cups [[Cookbook:Pastry flour|pastry flour]] or 3 cups [[Cookbook:All-purpose flour|all-purpose flour]]
* 2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Baking powder|baking powder]]
* 1/4 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

===Filling===
* 2 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* 1 1/2 cups [[Cookbook:Brown sugar|brown sugar]]
* 1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Corn syrup|corn syrup]]
* 3 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], melted
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Currant|currants]] or [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]]
* 1/2 cup chopped [[Cookbook:Walnut|walnuts]]
* 2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
* pinch of salt
* 1/2 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Vanilla extract|vanilla extract]]

==Method==

===Dough===
#Mix up the shortening, butter, and water until creamy. 
#While it's still creamy and not yet cold, sift in the flour, baking powder, and salt. 
#Mix gently until a dough forms. Try not to knead it while forming it into a large ball. 
#Separate the dough into two equal portions and chill 20 to 40 minutes.
#Separate the dough into two dozen equal balls.
#Roll each ball flat, ready to be placed.

===Tarts===
#Preheat oven to 350 °F.
#Beat the eggs well. 
#Add sugar, syrup, and melted butter and beat again. 
#Add the currants, walnuts, vinegar, salt, and vanilla extract and mix vigorously.
#Put a small amount of corn meal into tart tins, or count out 24 cupcake papers. 
#Place flat circles of uncooked pie crust into the pans, or place the circles into cupcake papers and insert them into the pans. 
#Fill the shells 2/3 full.
#Bake until the pastry is light brown, about 20 minutes. 

Makes 2 dozen tarts.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*For runnier tarts, cook for 15 to 17 minutes.
*Replace the currants with [[Cookbook:Coconut|coconut]], or omit entirely
*Replace the walnuts with [[Cookbook:Pecan|pecans]], or omit entirely
*Drizzle 4 oz melted [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]] over the cooked tarts

Take 2 pairs of giblets well scaled, put them to the broth, and simmer them till they are very tender. Take them out and strain the soup through a cloth. Put a piece of butter rolled in flour into the stewpan with some fine chopped parsley, chives, a little pennyroyal, and sweet marjoram. Place the soup over a slow fire, put in the giblets, fried butter, herbs, a little Madeira wine, some salt, and Cayenne pepper; when the herbs are tender, send the soup and giblets intermixed to table. This forms a very savory dish.

'''Raita''' is an [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] [[Cookbook:Garnish|garnish]] often served with spiced dishes. It acts as a cooling flavour as the fat in the yogurt dissolves and mollifies [[Cookbook:Chilli|chili]] in the curry, while the taste of [[Cookbook:Cucumber|cucumber]] and fresh [[Cookbook:Mint|mint]] or other herbs refreshes the palate. 

The essential ingredient is [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]]. Here is one simple recipe:

==Ingredients==

* 1/8 cup grated cucumber (about one inch (2.5 cm) of a cucumber)
* 1/2 cup yogurt
* 2 - 3 Mint leaves, chopped (More to taste)
* 2 Cilantro leaves, chopped (More to taste)
* (Optionally) 1 - 2 Tablespoons finely chopped or minced onions.
* Ground cumin

==Procedure==

# Grate about an [[Cookbook:Inch|inch]] of a cucumber and drain off some of the liquid.
# Stir the cucumber into half a [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] of yogurt. 
# Add chopped mint and [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]], and perhaps some finely chopped [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]].
# Sprinkle a little ground [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]] on top.

Prepare immediately before use; this doesn't keep.

==Ingredients==
*approx 625 ml warm water
*1 packet dry [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]]
*30 g [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] or [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]]
*1 kg [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1 pinch [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

==Procedure==
#Put half of the water into a container, add yeast and either sugar or honey.
#Take another container and put in 1 kg of flour. Form a crater in the middle into which you can pour the water with the yeast. Add a pinch of salt. Knead it and keep adding water until the dough has a good thick consistency. 
#Place the dough on a surface and let it stand for about 1 hour. Knead again to let the air out and knead it into the shape of a bread. Let it stand for another 45 minutes.

When fully mixed, remove one handful and mould into a the shape of a very thick hamburger patty. Roll the rissole in either flour or gravy powder (depending on your preferences). Cook on a hotplate, BBQ or in a frypan on a medium level of heat until cooked through and outer layer is crunchy.

Serve with vegetables, hot chips, salad or by themselves on bread or toast to make rissole burgers.

This is a delicious and quick recipe for a sunny day, or to bring back a little memory of summer. It's served warm so may not suit a winter evening! The combination of flavours ('''m'''ilky mozzarella, eggy '''p'''asta, sweet '''t'''omato and spicy basil) is just wonderful.

== Ingredients ==

*250g Fresh Egg Pasta
*2 Mozzarella Balls (cow or buffalo)
*About 10-15 small tomatoes or 4/5 larger tomatoes (you need about the same amount as the mozzarella)
*A good handful of Basil leaves, about 15-20
*Olive Oil
*Salt &amp; Black Pepper

== Method ==

The secret here is to prepare all the ingredients except the pasta ahead of time and let them soak together. I tend to stand the prepared bowl of ingredients in a sink full of hot water, so that the mozzarella starts to soften and the juices start to run.

#Chop the mozzarella and the tomatoes roughly and put them in a big salad type dish.
#Now tear up the basil and sprinkle it over the mozzarella and tomatoes.
#Drizzle on lots of extra virgin olive oil - at least 3 tablespoons (I usually do more!)
#Finally add a really good amount of salt and just a little black pepper. The salt will start to leech moisture out from the other ingredients and create a sauce.
#Wait!
#When you're ready, boil up the egg pasta, drain when cooked al dente (as usual) and then pour, still hot, on the other ingredients. Stir it up well, coating everything very well, and serve.

This is a delicious and quick recipe for a sunny day, or to bring back a little memory of summer. It's served warm so may not suit a winter evening! The combination of flavours (eggy pasta, milky mozzarella, sweet tomato and spicy basil) is just wonderful.

==Ingredients==

*250[[Cookbook:g|g]] fresh egg [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Mozzarella Cheese|mozzarella]] balls (cow or buffalo) - Works well with BRIE as well
*About 10-15 small [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]] or 4/5 larger tomatoes (you need about the same amount as the mozzarella) 
*A good handfull of [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]] leaves, about 15-20 
*Extra virgin [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]  (what else?)
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] &amp; black [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]

==Method==

The secret here is to prepare all the ingredients except the pasta ahead of time and let them soak together. I tend to stand the prepared bowl of ingredients in a sink full of hot water, so that the mozzarella starts to soften and the juices from the tomatoes start to run.

#Chop the mozzarella and the tomatoes roughly and put them in a big salad type dish. You're looking to create small cubish shapes between 1 cm and 1 inch (i.e. about 2.5 cm).
#Now tear up the basil and sprinkle it over the mozzarella and tomatoes. I always tear basil as I've read that it's the best way to preserve the flavour, but others may disagree.
#Drizzle on lots of extra virgin olive oil - at least 3 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] (I usually do more - for me it's pouring, not drizzling!) 
#Finally add a really good amount of salt and just a little black pepper. The salt will start to leech moisture out from the other ingredients and create a sauce. 
#Wait! 
#When you're ready, boil up the egg pasta, drain when cooked [[Cookbook:Pasta#Cooking pasta|al dente]] (as usual) and then pour, still hot, on the other ingredients. Stir it up, coating everything really well, and serve.

== Ingredients ==

*125g dried [[Cookbook:Soy|soybeans]]
*about 3.5L of water

== Yields ==

*2L soy milk 
*about 2 cups of [[Cookbook:Okara|okara]]

== Utensils ==

*a hand blender
*a large pot with, ideally, a transparent lid
*a large can to hold the milk
*a wooden spoon or another tool for stirring
*a sheet of clean cheesecloth or dish cloth
*a sealable container for the okara (optional, you can also elect to dump or compost it, or [[Cookbook:Tempeh|ferment it]])

== Procedure ==

#Put the soybeans and 1L of water into the pot and let them soak for 8 to 12 hours.
#Strip the soaked beans of their hulls by rubbing or crushing them between your fingers. Remove the hulls and pour away the excess water. While the hulls have about the same density as the beans and bean splinters, you can exploit their high flow resistance for separating the two: Fill some water into the bowl, then pour it away quickly enough to drag the hulls with it, but not so quickly that the beans will follow. This process resembles the winnowing of dry chaff from seeds. It's no problem if a few hulls remain.
#Add 1/2 L of fresh water and blend until you get a creamy substance. Add another half liter and blend until totally smooth.
#Bring the raw milk to a boil while stirring, then reduce the temperature to minimum, put the lid on top, and simmer for 20 minutes. Attention: May overboil, check frequently. Removing the lid will allow vapor to escape and reduce the foam. Another possibility is to pour a little bit of cold water on top of the lid.
#The bitter odor of the raw milk should now be gone. Remove the pot from the stove and add 1 liter of cold water.
#Line the inside of the can with the cheesecloth so it is completely covered, and the edges of the cloth hang over the edge of the can. The following process will not work if the body of the can is much wider than the opening, though. In this case, use a large bowl instead.
#Carefully pour the cooked, unfiltered milk into the can. Then fold the cheesecloth together at the top and lift it up out of the can so that the filtered milk drips into the can. Rotate the bottom of the cloth against the top and use your hands to exert additional pressure upon the soy mass. Be careful not to burn yourself.
#When you're no longer able to extract significant amounts of milk from the soy mass, open the cheesecloth, and put the resulting rubberlike, crumbly okara ball into the prepared container. Store it in a cool place for up to three days - you may also freeze it. Note: The okara requires much more heat processing than the milk in order to be digestible, e.g. boil it or bake it for at least one hour before eating it. The heat exposure during the baking of bread which contains okara is usually enough. Alternatively, it can be fermented into a special variety of [[Cookbook:Tempeh|tempeh]].

The soy milk can be kept in the refrigerator for about 5 days. You can also use it to make [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]] right away.

This is somewhat an interpretive recipe, so you have to get a little creative.  But creativity is what spawned it, and no two people come up with exactly the same sauce.  Regardless, what results will be very hot, and very delicious provided you like hot sauce.  If you don't, make Swiss pudding instead. 

Usually I get 6 to 10 [[Cookbook:Fluid Ounce|fluid ounces]] (about 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]], or 180 to 300 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) per batch.

== Ingredients ==

* 1 to 5 cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], depending on size and taste
* [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]] (any kind will do... apple, basalmic, red wine)
* [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]] juice (fresh, frozen, cocktail... you decide.)
* a squirt or three of [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]]
* 10 or so [[Cookbook:Habanero|habanero]] peppers, destemmed
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

== Instructions ==

# Mix all ingredients except peppers and honey in [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]] until you think you've got enough liquid.  It doesn't matter how much of anything you use&amp;mdash;just throw it all in.  As a general rule though, your total liquid volume should be about the size of 3 or 4 peppers.  It is important though, that you make sure it covers up to the middle of the blades your blender.
# Pulse until smooth.
# Add habaneros and pulse more, until they're fairly chopped up, still chunky.
# Add a squirt or three of honey, and blend for about 30 seconds.

Your resulting [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce]] should be fairly thick, but contain only very small particles of peppers and garlic.  If there are chunks bigger than grains of salt, keep blending until they are tiny.

Depending on how much you threw in, and how strong your taste buds are, this should make 50-200 servings.

'''Toad in the Hole''' is a [[Cookbook:Yorkshire Pudding|Yorkshire Pudding]], or thick pastry round, with sausages or pieces of meat in it, baked in the oven. This recipe is for a sausage Toad.
A further variation is made using fine chopped potatoes in a pudding-basin with a lump of meat in the centre, &amp; then boiled or steamed.

==Ingredients==

* 250g [[Cookbook:Sausage|Sausage]] links
* 1 recipe [[Cookbook:Yorkshire Pudding|Yorkshire Pudding]]

==Procedure==
#Preheat the oven to 200 °C.
#Bake the sausages in a [[Cookbook:Loaf Pan|loaf pan]] or roasting pan, for 10 minutes.
#Add [[Cookbook:Yorkshire Pudding|yorkshire pudding batter]] to the hot tray. You may need to add a bit of oil or fat if the sausages don't produce enough. 
#Bake in the oven for about 40 to 45 minutes. 
#Remove and serve when risen, firm and brown.

==Notes==

Toad in the Hole is commonly served with [[Cookbook:vegetable|vegetable]]s and [[Cookbook:gravy|gravy]].

'''Fried rice''' is a simple dish that can be prepared in as little as five minutes.

==Ingredients==
The basic ingredients are as follows:

* [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] (Can use leftover rice to speed things up)
* [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
* [[Cookbook:Spring onion|spring onions]]
* light [[Cookbook:Soy sauce|soy sauce]]
* dark soy sauce (optional)
* [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] &amp; seasoning

You can have just plain old fried rice but for something special you can add any extra ingredients you like. Here are a few suggestions:
* [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] chunks (or left-over chicken shreds)
* [[Cookbook:Char sui|Char sui]] (Chinese barbecue [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]])
* [[Cookbook:Pineapple|pineapple]] and [[Cookbook:Sweetcorn|sweetcorn]]
* sliced marinated [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]
* [[Cookbook:Curry|curry]] and [[Cookbook:Seafood|seafood]] (add [[Cookbook:Curry powder|curry powder]] for curry flavour)
* [[Cookbook:Prawn|Prawns]] are a possibility
* or consider adding peas towards the end of the dish
* Ham (leftovers work great)
* Asian Salad dressing (adds great flavor)
* Frozen vegetables are great

==Procedure==
#Boil the rice and leave to cool for a few hours so that most of the moisture has evaporated. This prevents the rice from sticking too much when you [[Cookbook:Stir fry|stir fry]]. If you intend to add meat, use a bit of oil and stir fry the meat until cooked and place the cooked meat aside to be added later. (If you are using leftover rice skip this step)
#Whip the egg. Dice the spring onions.
#Put two tablespoons of oil into the wok and heat until hot (if using Asian salad dressing add that to), then pour the egg into the hot oil. Keep stirring the egg as it crackles in the oil, breaking it up into smaller pieces. 
#Keep stirring, adding the rice into the wok (add leftover rice here straight out of the fridge with some oil). Stir the egg and rice evenly and add a pinch of sugar and sprinkle of salt for seasoning (not too much, as you will add soy sauce later on, skip if you used Asian salad dressing). 
#Add your extra ingredients, such as the meat you cooked earlier, and stir into the mixture. Add light soy sauce (about 1 tablespoon per serving). You can optionally add dark soy sauce, which mainly makes it look darker (the amount is 3 parts light soy to one of dark soy). Stir soy sauce evenly and finally add spring onions.
At this point, you could also add a few drops of sesame oil.

Note: If you use a wok at high heat, your fried rice may burn. To prevent this, keep stirring rigorously and turn the fried rice from bottom upwards or turn the heat down.

*A variant to this recipe involves stir-frying the rice and the vegetables before adding the egg.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:East Asian cuisines|East Asian Cuisines]] | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japanese Cuisine]] | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|Chinese Cuisine]]

The popular [[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|Chinese]] restaurant fare, the '''[[Cookbook:Potsticker|potsticker]]''' ('''Gyôza'''), although derived from a Chinese recipe, is more closely associated with the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japanese]] Gyôza or Pan-Fried Dumpling. Its contrast between filling and crispy exterior is a very pleasing sensation and, like many dishes, it can be melded to incorporate almost any flavour.

==Ingredients==

*1 package of at least 50 [[Cookbook:Wonton Wrapper|wonton wrappers]] (See '''Note''' below)
*1/4 to 1 [[Cookbook:Pound|lb.]] (1/10 to 1/2 [[Cookbook:kg|kg]]) ground [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] (1/2 pound of pork per ~50 dumplings)
Optionally:

''The following amounts are approximate ranges for each 1/2 pound of pork. The first amount listed is the recommended amount and the second amount given is the recommended maximum or minimum. Of course any of the below may be omitted.'':

*prepared [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]] (1 to 1/2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]]) {15 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]] to 2 mL}
*[[Cookbook:Ketchup|Ketchup]] (1 to 1/2 tablespoon) {15 mL to 2 mL} 
*[[Cookbook:Worcestershire Sauce|Worcestershire sauce]] (or [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]) (1 or 2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]]) {15 mL to 30 mL}
*[[Cookbook:Onion|green onions/spring onion]], [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell pepper]] or other [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili]] (1 or 2 tablespoon {15 mL to 30 mL} each, diced) 
*Anything you like, as you like it. Pork plays well with others. Just keep in mind that a filling that is too wet may expand too much during cooking and cause the dumpling to split open, while a filling that is too dry will become dryer during cooking. Any filling should easily maintain its shape if molded into small balls.

==Preparation==

The best way to combine any additives with the pork for the filling is to simply throw everything in a bowl and mix with your (clean!) hands. When your filling is ready get out your skins (wonton wrappers), cover them with a damp tea-towel or paper towel to prevent them from drying out and begin filling. Each dumpling should hold about 1/2 - 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp.]] of filling. Packaged skins should have sealing instructions. One sealing method is to wet two edges of a square (or one half of a circle) with water and fold over so that the dry edges meet the wet, pressing around the filling to ensure that all of the air has been removed from the dumpling then crimping the edges to ensure a tight seal. When your dumplings are all filled they can be frozen on a sheet pan then placed in plastic bags and kept frozen for up to six months.

==Cooking==

#Heat a heavy pan (NOT A NON-STICK SURFACE!) over medium to medium high heat.
#Brush lightly with vegtable oil.
#Add 8 to 10 dumplings, making sure not to crowd the pan.
#Let these dumplings cook without touching them for at least two minutes. They will sizzle and pop but do not touch them until they have stuck to the pan (usually about two minutes).
#When they have browned on the bottom (watch the edges near where the dumpling touches the pan) check for sticking.
#When the dumplings have stuck pour on 1/3 cup of stock, broth or water (about a 1/8 to 1/4 of an inch deep in the pan) and clamp on a tight lid.
#Cook until all the liquid has been converted to steam (once again, usually about two minutes. This is one of the more difficult parts of this process. You may have to adjust the amount of liquid used based on the liquid and your pan)
#Carefully remove the dumplings from the pan. Serve while hot.

==Dipping Sauces==
*[[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]] and [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]] (mix to taste)
*[[Cookbook:Black Bean Paste|black bean paste]]
*[[Cookbook:Peanut_Sauce|peanut sauce]]
*[[Cookbook:Plum Sauce|plum sauce]]
*[[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]] with some [[Cookbook:Saki|rice wine]] [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
*Anthing you can imagine. Look Beyond The Recipe!

==Note==

On Gyôza Skins: The primary difference between packaged gyôza skins and packaged wonton skins is shape (round for gyôza skins, square for wonton skins) this is a matter of preference, if both are available try both and decide which you prefer. You can also make these skins yourself but it is a time-consuming process and the dough has to be rolled quite thin (it is almost translucent) and in the end unless you're the [[w:Iron Chef|Iron Chef]] of gyôza cookery it won't make much difference.

That said, here's a recipe for [[Cookbook:Wonton Wrapper|wonton skins]]

'''Kapusniak''' is a hearty Central and Eastern European [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]] [[Cookbook:Soups|soup]].

==Ingredients==
===Soup===
*One litre or more [[Cookbook:Chicken broth|chicken broth]]
*One head of [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]]
*One or two [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]
*Four to six [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]]
*Four or five sticks of [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]]
*Two medium size [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]]
*Two to five cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
*One large can of diced [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
*Two to four sprigs of fresh [[Cookbook:Dill|dill]] (chopped up)
*Pickling spices (plus whatever spices are to your taste (I use [[Cookbook:Sage|sage]], [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]], [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]], [[Cookbook:Bay leaf|bay leaves]], [[Cookbook:Rosemary|rosemary]], etc.))
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste
*[[Cookbook:Olive oil|Olive oil]]

===Garnish===
*[[Cookbook:Sour cream|Sour cream]] or [[Cookbook:Yoghurt|Yoghurt]]
*Dill weed

==Procedure==
# Prepare the potatoes and carrots by peeling, then slicing into bite-size pieces. Wash and slice the celery into bite-sized pieces. The onions and garlic must be peeled and chopped. The cabbage should be sliced. 
# In a large cooking pot heat enough olive oil to fry the chopped onions and garlic over medium heat. Three or four tablespoons of oil should be enough. If not, add more oil. 
# Let the onions and garlic simmer over medium or low heat for 8 to 10 minutes. 
# Now add one liter of chicken broth and bring to a boil. 
# Now add the sliced potatoes, carrots and celery; bring to a boil and simmer over medium heat until vegetables are almost tender enough to eat. 
# While the vegetables are boiling add any other spices your heart may desire (you may use a spice container to easily remove their remnants afterwards). Put the spice in the boiling soup and leave it there until the soup is finished. 
# While the soup is simmering add salt and pepper to taste, a dash of [[Cookbook:Worcestershire Sauce|Worcester]], soya sauce, seasoned salt, garlic salt or celery salt until the soup is really tasty. 
# If the soup becomes too thick add some more chicken broth but it should be a hearty soup with plenty of vegetables. 
# When the vegetables seem tender, add the can of tomatoes and the shredded cabbage. Again let the soup simmer over medium heat continue tasting to see whether your imagination has worked magic. 
# Lastly, add the chopped fresh dill. When it’s done, EAT!

Serves about 5.

This bread takes about three hours to make and about 1/2 hour of hands-on work.

==Ingredients==
* 1/3 [[Cookbook:cup|cup]] lukewarm water
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:sugar|sugar]]
* 2 packets active dry [[Cookbook:yeast|yeast]]
* 3 [[Cookbook:tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:butter|butter]]
* 1 tablespoon light [[Cookbook:brown sugar|brown sugar]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
* 1 cup hot water or [[Cookbook:buttermilk|buttermilk]]
* 4 cups white [[Cookbook:flour|flour]]

==Procedure==
# In a bowl, mix the lukewarm water, 1/2 teaspoon sugar, and active dry yeast. Let stand until yeast mixture becomes frothy and increases in volume.
# While the yeast mixture is standing, in a separate large mixing bowl, mix the butter, 1 tablespoon light brown sugar, salt, and hot water or buttermilk.
# Once the yeast mixture becomes frothy, add the yeast mixture to the separate large mixing bowl.
# Add 2 cups of white flour to the large mixing bowl. Stir at slow speed with an electric mixer for 1 minute. After that, mix at medium speed for 3 minutes, scraping the sides of the bowl frequently.
# With the remaining 2 cups of white flour, add the remaining flour at about 1/4 to 1/2 cups at a time to the large mixing bowl, and continually mix with a spoon until the mixture begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl or it becomes difficult to add more flour. 
# Cover the mixture with plastic wrap and a towel. Place in a warm room with no drafts until the batter doubles in volume. About 45 minutes to 1 hour.
# After the batter was allowed to sit, stir it down with a spoon (about 25 strokes).
# Divide the batter into 2 loaf pans. Wet fingers and push into the corners and smooth out.
# Cover both setups with plastic. Place in a warm room and let the batter rise until it just reaches the tops of the pans (about 25 minutes). Watch carefully and don't let the batter rise too high (if it does rise too high, punch it down a little bit and let it rise again.)
# After the batter was allowed to rise in the loaf pans, bake at 375° for 30 to 45 minutes. The bread is done when it sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom of the pan and is browned to the baker's preference.
# Turn out on a wire rack and let cool.

'''Latkes''' are potato pancakes, commonly associated with the Jewish cultural tradition in the United States and Europe. They can be and are served any time, but traditionally form part of the menu during the celebration of Chanukah. Eating potato pancakes is not one of the mitzvot of Chanukah; that is, it is not a fundamental part of the Chanukah rituals, and has no religious significance. It is seen as appropriate to eat foods cooked in oil during a festival that celebrates the miracle of the Chanukah oil. In Israel, potato pancakes are familiar and well-liked but the [[Cookbook:Sufganiya|sufganiya]] (jelly doughnut) is considered to be more Israeli.

Various recipes for potato pancakes vary in the degree of fineness to which the potatoes are grated. Some are grated to long strips, others to a fine powder. Both latkes and potato pancakes bear a distant resemblance to the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|American]] dish, [[Cookbook:Hash Browns|hash browns]]; however, hash browns are merely coarsely grated potatoes with no binding ingredients or flour.

==Ingredients==
*4 large [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]
*1 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]], beaten
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Matzo|Matzo]] meal, [[Cookbook:Cornmeal|cornmeal]], or [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] to taste
*2 tablespoons vegetable [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]
*[[Cookbook:Applesauce|applesauce]], [[Cookbook:Sour Cream|sour cream]], and/or [[Cookbook:sugar|sugar]]

==Procedure==
#Peel potatoes and onion and grate.
#Mix potato and onion with egg, meal, and salt.
#Heat oil in a 10&quot; pan over medium heat until it is quite hot.  Drop 1-2 tablespoons of the potato mixture onto the pan per pancake.  Turn once to allow both sides to fry.
#Serve with applesauce, sour cream, and/or sugar as a topping.

Serves four.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Variants include cheese latkes, zucchini latkes, and apple latkes.

# Mix this sauce with an equal quantity of Velute sauce (No. 2) or Espagnole sauce, (No. 1), let it boil and pass through a sieve again and at the last add the castor sugar, the juice of half a lemon, and an ounce of fresh butter.

'''Beef Jerky''' is ideal for road trips and camping, as it will not perish as readily as fresh meat. It is suitable not only as a snack but also as a meal. This recipe for jerky is not heavily brined and flavored as commercial jerky is.

Other meats may be substituted instead of beef, but use caution.

==Ingredients==
* ¾ tsp. [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]]
* ¼ tsp. [[Cookbook:Pepper|Pepper]]
* 1 tbl. [[Cookbook:Brown sugar|Brown sugar]]
* ¼ tsp. [[Cookbook:Garlic|Garlic]]
* 2 tbl. [[Cookbook:Worcestershire Sauce|Worcestershire sauce]] or [[Cookbook:Teriyaki Sauce|Teriyaki sauce]]
* ¼ tsp. [[Cookbook:Liquid smoke|Liquid smoke]]
* 1 Lb. (450g) [[Cookbook:Beef|Beef]] ([[Cookbook:Flank steak|Flank]] or [[Cookbook:Skirt steak|Skirt steak]] is ideal)
* Other common seasonings may include (¼ tsp. of) cayenne pepper, cheese powder, and/or white pepper

== Procedure ==
# Mince or press garlic.  
# Mix all ingredients except beef to make brine.
# Slice beef into ¼&quot; thick strips. Small chunks (about ¾&quot;) of stewing beef may also be used. If possible, cut along the grain of the meat rather than across it. It may be easier to freeze the meat before attempting to cut it, as this will stop the meat pulling and deforming so easily.
# Dunk slices in brine. Meat may be left overnight on a glass plate in the refrigerator to marinate if desired.
# Place meat on racks and dry in a food dehydrator at 145°F (63°C) for 6 - 8 hours.  May be dried in a 150°F (65°C) oven with foil-covered racks. In oven, turn meat over 3 - 4 hours into drying time and reduce temperature to 130°F (55°C).
# Meat should bend but not break when properly dried.

'''No-Bake Cookies'''.  These cookies are delicious, fast, and easy to customize.

==Ingredients==
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Chocolate|cocoa powder]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] of any thickness
* 2 cups [[Cookbook:Oatmeal|oatmeal]]
* 1 cup white [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1/2 pound [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]

==Preparation==
# Melt the butter in a saucepan.
# Mix the cocoa powder, milk, and sugar with the butter.  Stir until the mix has a nice, even consistency.
# Pour the oatmeal into the saucepan and stir until the oatmeal is evenly distributed throughout.
# Let the mixture cool for five to ten minutes.
# Spoon the mixture into balls on a cookie sheet, leaving enough space between them for spreading out.
# Let stand on counter for at least 20 minutes to stiffen, or you may refrigerate for quicker stiffening of the cookies.

==Notes, Tips and Variations==
You can also use peanut butter to give the no-bake cookies something extra.

Rather than forming cookies, pour the hot mixture into a pie pan with a
crust of [[Cookbook:Graham Cracker|Graham crackers]]. Once cooled, top the mix with whipped cream 
and fruit or any other desired topping.

During winter season, you can see various kinds of steamed buns at every convenience store in Japan. This is known as a kind of Dim Sum in America and Europe. Japanese style buns are bigger. It is good for snacks.

== Sweet red bean paste filling ==

=== Ingredients ===
*3 ⅔ oz (110 g) Japanese red beans ([[Cookbook:Azuki Bean|azuki]])
*5 ⅓ oz (150 g) granulated [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1 tablespoons [[Cookbook:starch syrup|starch syrup]], for shining
*a dash [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

=== Procedure ===
#Wash the beans well.
#In a large sauce pan, put the beans and fill the 14 oz/400 ml water or the amount filled over the beans. Bring to a [[Cookbook:boiling|boil]] over high heat. Drain the water. Do this step two more times to get rid of harshness.
#Fill up with water again and cook over low heat after boiling for 30-40 minutes. Add more water if the beans come out from the water. Remove any scum.
#If the bean can be crushed easily by fingers, it is done; if not, cook more. Shut off the heat and steam for 10 minutes with cover.
#Drain the beans and liquid. Do NOT throw the liquid away. Set the beans aside. Place back only the liquid, and add sugar and salt in it. Heat until the sugar and salt have dissolved. Shut the heat.
#Transfer the beans to the pan. Let it stay until sweet taste infiltrates to the beans for 30 minutes.
#Over low heat, boil away until it becomes thick enough to be able to form it into a ball by hand. Be careful not to get burned.
#Let it cool before filling.

== Dough ==
=== Ingredients ===
(Enough for 16 buns)

*1¼ oz package active dry [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]] (2¼ teaspoons)
*1 teaspoon granulated [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1 cup lukewarm water (40-45°C)
*3 cups all-purpose [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] (reserve 1 tablespoon if mixing by hand)

=== Procedure ===

#In small bowl, sprinkle yeast and sugar evenly over the lukewarm water; stir until yeast dissolves. Let stand 10 minutes or until foamy.
#In large bowl or in food processor, combine flour and yeast mixture and mix well, or process 1 minute. If mixing by hand, sprinkle work surface with the reserved 1 tablespoon flour; turn dough out onto work surface and knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.
#Spray large bowl with non-stick cooking spray; place dough in bowl. Cover loosely with plastic wrap or a damp towel, and let rise until dough triples in volume, about 3 hours. Punch down and wrap in plastic until ready to use. Will keep 3 days in the refrigerator and up to 2 months in the freezer.

'''Béchamel''' is one of the five &quot;mother [[Cookbook:Sauces|sauces]]&quot; in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|French cuisine]].  A basic white sauce, it can be used as the base of many other sauces.

Yield is 4 cups béchamel.

==Ingredients==

*¼ cup unsalted butter
*¼ cup white flour
*4½ cups scalded whole milk &gt; 3% milk fat
For us Europeans:
* 50g butter
* 50g white wheat flour (type 405)
* 500 ml milk 

And optional spices:
* salt
* pepper
or
*1 small onion peeled &amp; stuck with a clove 
*1 fresh bay laurel leaf

==Procedure==

#Soften the unsalted butter and knead into the flour.
#Cook the roux of butter and flour over gentle heat, but do not brown.
#Test the roux as it should not have apparent flour taste.
#Add milk to new pot
#Peel the onion and stick with one clove.
#Assemble into a scalding pot with one bay leaf.
#Stir some more. Do not let the milk adhere and cook to pot bottom.
#Keep stirring until milk is scalded at 180°F (80°C).
#Remove cloved onion and bay leaf.
#Combine scalded milk slowly into cooked roux.
#Stir and cook for 15 minutes. No lumps should be present.

==Variations==
The first is for general all-purpose usage.
The second is for desserts requiring a thickening.
The third is for my signature lasagne ferrera.
The fourth is for Atkins compliance.
The last one lends a peculiar sweetness when made with a two-row brewers' malt.

Pure olive oils and virgin olive oils are somewhat orthodox.
Vegetable oils and other oils are certainly outside orthodoxy.

'''Porridge''' (also known in American English as '''hot cereal'''), is a simple dish made by boiling [[Cookbook:Grain|grain]] (normally [[Cookbook:Rolled Oats|rolled oats]]) in water or milk.

==Ingredients==
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (120 [[Cookbook:ml|ml]]) rolled oats or other grain
* 3/4 cup (180 ml) water
* 3/4 cup (180 ml) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]

==Procedure==
#Mix oats and water, then bring to the [[Cookbook:Boiling|boil]] covered with a lid.
#Once bubbling, stir and reduce temperature to the lowest possible to maintain [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmering]]. Replace lid and watch carefully to prevent boiling over.
#Stir every minute or so. After five minutes, remove lid, stir thoroughly and add milk.
#Mix through, and keep stirring until fully mixed.
#Serve and add [[Cookbook:raisins|raisins]], [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]], [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]], [[Cookbook:Maple Syrup|maple syrup]], a pinch of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]] or inverted sugar syrup to taste.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
If you want to avoid milk products, it is also possible to use [[Cookbook:Soy Milk|soy milk]] instead of cow's milk. Porridge can also be made using only water, or only milk depending on taste.
You can also add a piece of salt.

Different grains will require different cooking times.  Steel cut oats, for example, should simmer for 20-30 minutes, or to the desired texture.

*¼ cup (60mL) [[Cookbook:Fish Sauce|fish sauce]]
*¼ cup and 1 tablespoon (75mL) [[Cookbook:Vinegar|white vinegar]] (or [[Cookbook:Rice vinegar|rice vinegar]])

*2 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] (chopped)
*2 tablespoons (30mL) dried [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|red chili pepper flakes]] (or to taste)
*½ pound (225g) of [[Cookbook:Shrimp|shrimp]], [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]], [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]], [[Cookbook:Squid|squid]], or [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] (or a combination of the above)
*assorted vegetables (e.g. shredded [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]], [[Cookbook:Onion|white onions]], red or green [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|peppers]])
*2 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
*4 chopped [[Cookbook:Green onion|green onions]]
*¾ pound (340g) of [[Cookbook:Bean Sprout|bean sprouts]]
*¾ cup (175mL) chopped unroasted [[Cookbook:Peanut|peanuts]]

===Optional===
* wedge of [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]] (garnish)
* [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]] leaves (garnish)

== Procedure ==
# Soak the noodles in warm water for about 20 minutes and strain. (Time saver: pour boiling water over the noodles and let them sit for 7 minutes.)
# Mix the fish sauce with the vinegar, sugar and tamarind (optional: lime juice) together in a small bowl.
# Heat the vegetable oil in the wok on high, brown the chopped garlic and chili peppers for a minute.
# Cook the meats/tofu in oil, until they are browned (6-8 minutes).

# Add the fish sauce mix into the wok, mix it all up and turn the heat down to medium.
# Add the chopped green onions and bean sprouts, then stir fry for 2 more minutes.
# Serve on a large plate or bowl. Garnish with chopped peanuts and optionally, chopped cilantro and a wedge of lime.

== Variations ==
{{Wikipedia|Pad Thai}}
*A squirt of [[Cookbook:Ketchup|ketchup]] can be used instead of tamarind for a quick-and-easy variation.
*Chop cilantro and mix it with the noodles and other ingredients at the last minute. (Take care not to overcook it, or it will become slimy.)

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Meat_Recipes|Meat recipes]]

A '''hamburger''' (or, less frequently, a '''hamburg''') is a variant on a [[Cookbook:Sandwiches|sandwich]] involving a patty of ground [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]], usually [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] (known in the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] as a '''beefburger'''), or a [[Cookbook:Vegan_cuisine#Vegan_Patties|vegetarian patty]].

==Ingredients==
*500[[Cookbook:g|g]] (1.1 [[Cookbook:Pound|lb]]) minced (ground) [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]
*[[Cookbook:Herbs and Spices|Herbs and spices]] (optional - see suggestions)
*[[Cookbook:Cheese|Cheese]] (optional - see suggestions)
*Salad ([[Cookbook:Lettuce|lettuce]], [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]], [[Cookbook:Alfalfa|alfalfa sprouts]], [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]], [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]] etc. - optional)
*1 hamburger bun for each burger

==Procedure==
#Mix the beef, together with any optional ingredients, in a [[Cookbook:Food Processor|food processor]] for about 10-30 seconds. If your beef is not yet ground, you may have to mix for a minute or so.
#Remove the beef from the food processor and shape by hand into burgers. You should get between 4-6 burgers from 500g (1.1 lb) of beef.
#The burgers can be [[Cookbook:Frying|fried]] or [[Cookbook:Grilling|grilled]] for about 5 mins on each side for burgers which aren't too thick.
#Ensure your burgers are fully cooked through before serving. If your burgers are quite thick or if you are unsure, you can cut one open to ensure the insides are browned. If the insides are red, there is a chance that the meat is not fully cooked. Alternately, you can insert a meat thermometer into the center of the burger, if the temperature reads less than 71°C (160°F), your burger is undercooked.
#Serve each burger on a bun ([[Cookbook:Sesame Seed|sesame seed]] usually), optionally with [[Cookbook:Relish|relish]], sliced [[Cookbook:Pickle|pickles]], [[Cookbook:Ketchup|ketchup]], [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]], [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]], [[Cookbook:Ranch Dressing|ranch dressing]], [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]], lettuce, tomato and/or onion.

Some suggestions of what to add to the meat include: [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], onion flakes or a small onion, [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]], [[Cookbook:Worcestershire Sauce|worcestershire sauce]], [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]], [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]], [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]], butter and/or 2 tsp of your favorite [[Cookbook:Hot Sauce|hot sauce]] for some kick. The amounts of herbs and/or spices are up to your local taste and meat quality. Depending on the quality of your local beef, for example, you may wish to add some [[Cookbook:Beef Stock|beef stock]] to improve the flavour. If you add any liquids, mix the ground beef well then squeeze out the extra juice when forming patties.

For further serving suggestions, see the [[w:Hamburger#Serving style|Wikipedia article on hamburgers]].

==Notes, tips and variations==
*You can use almost any type of minced (ground) [[Cookbook:Meat and poultry|meat]] to make hamburgers, including [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]], [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]], [[Cookbook:Turkey|turkey]], [[Cookbook:Lamb|lamb]], [[Cookbook:Bison|bison]], [[Cookbook:Venison|venison]], [[Cookbook:Ostrich|ostrich]], [[Cookbook:Kangaroo|kangaroo]], or even a meat substitute such as [[Cookbook:Quorn|Quorn]].  Some variations of hamburgers call for mixing different types of meat (e.g. ground beef and ground pork).
*If your burgers fall apart, adding an [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] yolk will help keep it together. Buying lean ground beef will also help, although if the meat is too lean the burger may be excessively dry.
*Try adding a pat of butter in the center of each burger for an excellent hamburger.
*You may wish to experiment with including cheese in the centre of your burger before cooking.
*Spices which can work well in hamburgers include [[Cookbook:Black Pepper|black pepper]], [[Cookbook:Chili|chili]] (either fresh or powder), [[Cookbook:Worcestershire Sauce|Worcestershire Sauce]] and [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]. Experiment to find good combinations.
*Almost any herb can work, including [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]], [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]] and [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]].
*Some other things which are also sometimes added to hamburgers include: diced onions, bread crumbs, crushed saltine crackers.
*Burgers can also be [[Cookbook:Smoking|smoked]] on a grill. Smoked burgers will appear red and glazed on the outside, but browned on the inside. Smoking a burger before grilling it is an excellent way to seal in the flavorful juices.
*Adding meat and spices together in a bowl and mixing by hand until the spices are distributed may produce better results. This will also help to stop your burgers from falling apart.
*Some [[Cookbook:Vegan_cuisine#Vegan_Patties|vegan patties]] make excellent meat substitutes, especially for Hamburgers, where strong spices make the difference close to indistinguishable.

This popular Bulgarian dish makes one serving.

== Ingredients ==
* About 200-300 grams cheese (you may use as many different kinds of cheese as you like, but make sure to include feta cheese as it is the traditional one for this dish and is not as oily when it melts)
* 1 egg
* various chopped herbs

And everything else is optional because Bulgarians use whatever is left over in the fridge to make this dish: 
* any kind of cooked chicken, pork, or beef
* any kind of sausages or hot dogs
* vegetables: tomatoes, peppers, small hot pepper, mushrooms, cooked potatoes
* fresh greens: parsley, dill, celery leaves

== Procedure ==

# Chop or dice everything you want to put in. 
# Make alternating layers of cheese, meat, and vegetables, and finish with cheese. 
# Bake in the oven at 200 C (app. 375 F) for 20 minutes or until the cheese is melted. 
# Break the egg on top and put back in the oven for another 5-10 minutes depending on how well-done you like your eggs. 
# Serve with fresh bread or toast. Enjoy!

This is a popular dish from Bulgaria and can be eaten on its own or as part of a main meal.  This recipe will serve 2-3 people and can be prepared in less than an hour.

==Ingredients==
[[Image:Banica-imagesfrombulgaria.jpg|right|thumb|Banitsa is a Bulgarian Pastry.]]
* 2 packets of [[Cookbook:phyllo dough|phyllo dough]] [a low fat pastry] (Bulgarian &quot;[[Cookbook:fini kori|fini kori]]&quot; or phyllo from the frozen desserts section)
* 200 grams of yellow [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]] (Bulgarian [[Cookbook:kashkaval|kashkaval]] or a mixture of [[Cookbook:cheddar|cheddar]] and [[Cookbook:mozzarella|mozzarella]])
* 500 grams of white cheese (Bulgarian [[Cookbook:sirene|sirene]] or [[Cookbook:feta cheese|feta cheese]])
* 7 [[Cookbook:Eggs|eggs]]
* 100 grams of [[Cookbook:butter|butter]]
* 1/2 cup of [[Cookbook:soda water|soda water]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:yogurt|yogurt]]

==Procedure==
# Mix six of the eggs, the grated butter, the crumbled white cheese, the yellow cheese cut in small pieces, and the yogurt. 
# In a buttered pan, lay a layer of the phyllo dough, spread a layer of the mixture, and continue alternating layers so that the phyllo and the mixture are finished about the same time. 
# Finish with a layer of phyllo dough. 
# Cut the banitsa into serving pieces. 
# Mix the last egg with the soda water and stir. 
# Pour the mixture over the banitsa and make sure there are no pieces of the phyllo dough left dry.
# [[Cookbook:Bake|Bake]] in a preheated oven at 200 °C (390 °F) for 40 minutes, or until golden. Enjoy!

Alternative: Instead of piling the phyllo leaves on top of each other, just spread the mixture on the phyllo, top with a little soda and roll two of the leaves up around the mixture. The rolled phyllo is then aligned in a spiral in the pan. (see picture). Sprinkle with some oil before baking.

==Variations==
===Spinach Bannitza===
Same as the regular banitsa recipe, but substitute 3 eggs with 1/2 kilogram [[Cookbook:spinach|spinach]], washed, cut and lightly fried (no more than five minutes).

===Green Onion Banitsa===
Same as the regular banitsa recipe, but substitute 3 eggs with 5-10 stalks of [[Cookbook:green onion|green onion]] (about 1 cup diced onion), lightly fried (no more than ten minutes).

Boil for less than 10 min or until the mushrooms are cooked but not soft, add the noodles and boil until cooked. Take the pot off the burner, add the lemon juice, the parsley and more milk if you like the soup to be less thick. Enjoy!

: '''Warning''': This recipe is experimental and may require refinement.


A '''Paprika Bratwurst''' is similar to a [[Cookbook:Seitan_Bratwurst|Seitan_Bratwurst]]. 

==Ingredients==

* [[Cookbook:Gluten|Gluten]] (see [[Cookbook:Seitan|Seitan]] for how to gain gluten from wheat flour)
* Water, [[Cookbook:Soy_sauce|Soy sauce]]. [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|Vegetable oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Onion|Onion]], [[Cookbook:Bell pepper|Bell pepper]], [[Cookbook:Paprika|Paprika]] and [[Cookbook:Chili pepper|Chili pepper]] 
* additional spices, e.g.: [[Cookbook:Coriander|Coriander]], [[Cookbook:Cardamom|Cardamom]], [[Cookbook:Thyme|Thyme]] and [[Cookbook:Oregano|Oregano]]
* optional: [[Cookbook:Tofu|Tofu]]

==Procedure==
* see [[Cookbook:Seitan Bratwurst|Seitan Bratwurst]]
* Cut onions and bell peppers in small chunks. Frying onions and bell peppers lightly adds to the taste.
* Mix bell peppers, paprika powder and chilies or chilie powder into the dry gluten powder. It is much easier to mix solid and liquid ingredients separately than adding ingredients to the gluten dough later, as it is very rubbery and sticky.
* To fry the sausages an oiled non-stick pan is recommended. To fry the sausages on a grill they must be cooked first in order to make the gluten dough less rubbery.

== Attention ==

If you use tofu, onions and bell peppers generously the consistency of the sausages may not be sticky enough for the sausages to hold together.

Maybe you could process/blend these items to a puree with the liquid you are using to hydrate the gluten and that would solve the problem.

[[Image:Kashkaval_Pane.jpg|right]]
'''Kashkaval pane''' is a [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] dish of fried Kashkaval, a type of cottage cheese.

==Ingredients==
*12oz Yellow Cheese [[Cookbook:Kashkaval|Kashkaval]], 
*[[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] for [[Cookbook:Deep Fat Frying|deep frying]],

Also spelled and pronounced [[Cookbook:Tabouli|Tabouli]] - regional pronunciations vary.

== Ingredients ==

*1/2 cup bulghur wheat (fine grind is best, medium grind acceptable)
*2 bunches parsley (flat leaf or curly Italian)
*1 bunch green onion 
*Tomatoes - at least 2 cups chopped 
*5 or 6 stalks fresh mint
*2 to 3 lemons - to taste
*Olive oil
*Salt
*Cucumbers (optional)
*Romaine lettuce leaves (garnish &amp; scoopers, optional)
*Fresh grape leaves (scoopers - optional)

== Procedures ==

#Soak the bulghur wheat in at least three times its volume of cold water. Fine grind only needs a half hour of soaking. Medium grind needs longer. (Bulghur wheat has already been parboiled before cracking or grinding, so it doesn’t need further cooking to be edible in tabbouli.)
#Drain bulghur. 
#Chop the parsley leaves, green onions, mint, tomatoes and cucumbers.
#Chop the parsley quite fine, using a knife, not food processor. 
#Mix veggies and bulghur together. Douse with strained lemon juice. If you are not ready to serve immediately, then cover and hold in a cool place. Do NOT add salt and olive oil until immediately before serving.

== Notes, tips, and variations ==

You may garnish with more diced tomatoes and/or diced cucumber, and insert lettuce or fresh grape leaves around the sides of the bowl. Use green leaves to scoop up the salad, popping leaf and salad into mouth.

[[Cookbook:Tabbouleh|Tabbouleh]] is a variant on the same dish.

'''Nachynka''' in Ukrainian literally means stuffing.  This dish is usually not stuffed inside anything, but served as a side dish.

==Ingredients==
*½ cup (125 ml) [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*1 cup (250 ml) [[Cookbook:Cornmeal|cornmeal]]
*3 cups (750 ml) homogenized [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*2 large [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
*1 tsp (15 ml) [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*½ tsp (7 ml) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1 tsp (15 ml) [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
*butter to grease casserole dish

==Procedure==
#Melt butter in a pot on medium heat.
#Add cornmeal.  Stir mixture to warm up the cornmeal.
#Add milk.  Stir until mixture has thickened.
#Beat eggs.  Beat in salt, sugar, and baking powder.
#Slowly add some of the thickened cornmeal mixture to the egg mixture while mixing to temper the eggs.
#Stir the egg mixture into the rest of the cornmeal.
#Pour the mixture into a greased casserole dish
#Bake at 350°F (175°C) for 30 minutes or until the top has browned

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*While you are thickening the cornmeal mixture, you have enough time to beat the eggs
*Doubling the recipe will yield enough to fill a 2 litre casserole dish

For different flavour variations:
*Mix in a ¼ teaspoon of cinnamon.
*Chop up a small onion and cook till tender in the butter, before adding cornmeal.

==Warnings==
*Do not add the egg mixture to the cornmeal.  Some of the eggs will cook on impact resulting in streaks of cooked eggs and a heavier Nachynka

This recipe yields about 50 [[w:Tamal|tamales]].

== Ingredients ==
=== Spices and seasonings mix ===
* ½ [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Corn Oil|corn oil]]
* 6 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|chili powder]]
* 3 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] powder
* 3 tablespoon ground [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]] (comino)
* 1 tablespoon (or less) [[Cookbook:Black Pepper|black pepper]]
* 2 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

=== Masa mix ===
* 4 [[Cookbook:Pound|lb]] bag [[Cookbook:Corn Masa|corn masa]]
* 3 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]]
* 3 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]] seeds
* 3 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|chili powder]]
* 3 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] powder
* 2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] of [[Cookbook:Corn Oil|corn oil]] (''add only when indicated!'')

=== Meats and miscellaneous ===
* 1 [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] roast (6-8 [[Cookbook:Pound|pounds]])
* 1 large [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] (5 pounds)
* about 50 [[Cookbook:Corn|corn]] husks/shucks

=== Equipment ===
* a large capacity steamer
* measuring cups
* tongs
* measuring spoons
* a draining spoon
* a spreader

=== Serving (optional) ===
* [[Cookbook:Salsa|salsa]]

== Preparation ==
=== Cook and shred pork roast ===
# Cut the roast into fist-size chunks.
# Put the chunks into a pan and cover with water.
# Boil for about 2½ hours or until it becomes really tender.
# After the meat is really tender, take it out of the [[Cookbook:Broth|broth]] to cool.  Save at least a [[Cookbook:Quart|quart]] of the broth, as you will need it for the Masa!
# After the roast chunks are cool enough to handle easily, shred them with your fingers.  Try to remove and discard the [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]] as you go.  If you have cooked the roast chunks thoroughly, it will be easy to shred into small pieces with your fingers.

=== Cook and shred chicken ===
# Cover the [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] with water in a large pot.
# Boil for 2 hours or until the chicken is done and tender.
# Take the chicken out of the [[Cookbook:Broth|broth]] and allow the chicken to cool.  Save at least a [[Cookbook:Quart|quart]] of the chicken broth!
# Remove and discard the skin. Take the chicken meat off the bones and shred the it into very small filaments.  Discard any large chunks of fat.

=== Combine pork and chicken ===
# Combine both meats in very large pan.
# Mix together, making sure that the meats are thoroughly combined and mixed well.

=== Add the spices and seasonings ===
# Mix the &quot;Spices and seasonings mix&quot; from section 1.2 in a small pan and warm on the stove. Do not cook the oil and seasonings mix, but just gently warm on the stove.
# When the oil and seasonings mix is warm, pour over the meat and mix with your hands until it is completely distributed through the meat. It takes 10 minutes to get the mixture completely uniform.

=== Make the corn masa dough mix ===
# Start with 2 lbs. of the [[Cookbook:Corn Masa|Masa flour]].
# Skim the [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]] off the broth that you saved from the pork and chicken.  Throw the fat away, and save the broth.
# Warm the broth from the pork and chicken up.  Don't get it hot, just nice and warm.
# Put the 2 lbs. of Masa in a large bowl.
# Add the &quot;Masa mix&quot; in section 1.3, excepting the corn oil, to the Masa and mix until it is completely incorporated.
# Add 2 cups of corn oil.
# Begin to slowly work in 2 quarts of the warm chicken/pork broth, about a [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] at a time. Work the mixture with your hands to make dough. Slowly add the warm broth one cup at a time as you continue to work the mixture with your hands.  If it is too dry, add enough warm water to get it right for spreading. It should be about like thick [[Cookbook:Peanut Butter|peanut butter]]. If it is too thin, add more Masa; if it is too thick, add more broth or warm water. Thick peanut butter is the consistency you are trying for.

=== Prepare the corn shucks ===
# Soak the shucks in a sink full of warm water for about 2 hours.
# Carefully separate them when they get soft.  Try to not tear or damage the corn shucks.  It is easier to make the tamales if the shucks are in one piece.

=== Build the tamales ===
# Once the corn shucks are soft, take a few at a time out of the water, shake the water off, and lay them on the counter on a towel.
# Pick up a shuck, lay it across the palm of your hand with the small end toward your fingers. Scoop up about ½ cup of the Masa dough with a spatula, then smear it on the shuck.
# Cover about left 2/3 of the shuck with Masa and leave 1/3 on the right uncovered. Similarly, cover the bottom 2/3 of the shuck, and leave the top 1/3 uncovered.  You need to leave the top and side uncovered so you can fold it up later.  Lay them out.
# When you have covered 5 to 10 of the shucks with Masa, take about 1 tablespoon of meat and lay it on the masa about 1 inch from the left edge.
# Starting on the left side (the side where the Masa dough goes all the way to the edge), roll the tamale all the way to the right edge. Now, fold the top of the shuck over like an envelope and lay tamale on the counter with the fold on the under side. Roll the next one the same until all your shucks with masa on them are rolled.

=== Cook the tamales ===
# Add about 3 [[Cookbook:Pint|pints]] of water to the pot, then start stacking the tamales upright until full. The envelope end of the tamal will be on the bottom, the open end of the tamal should be on top.  Continue to fill the pot. The tamales need to pack tight enough that they do not fall over and begin to unfold.
# Cover the pot and bring the water to a boil, then reduce heat to medium low and cook for at least 2 hours.
# Check water several times and add more if it is getting low, as you do not want to boil it dry.
# Add more water as you need to.
# If you believe that the cooking is finished, take one tamal out and leave it on the counter for about 5 minutes to test. Unwrap it and it should be firm, with no raw masa.
# When the cooking is finished, remove all the tamales and let them cool on the counter, then put in bags for the freezer, 6 to a bag.
You can save the tamales in the freezer indefinitely if they are vacuum-sealed.  If you use Zip Lock bags, they will stay for up to a year in the freezer.

==Ingredients==
*1 small [[Cookbook:Pumpkin|pumpkin]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] pinch, to taste
*[[Cookbook:Pepper|Pepper]] pinch, to taste
*[[Cookbook:Butter|Butter]] tablespoon or so, to taste

==Procedure==
#Clean your pumpkin well, being careful to remove manure, dirt, etc. Chop off the stem.
#Cook the cleaned pumpkin in a 375 °F oven for approx 45 minutes per 250g. A small pumpkin of less than 500g works best. 
#Remove pumpkin and allow to rest for 5-10 minutes.
#During this time, take out sea salt, butter, and your pepper mill.
#Chop pumpkin in half with cleaver, butcher knife, or kitchen hatchet.
#Remove seeds and guts; roast seeds and discard the rest.
#Separate the skin from the flesh.
#Place hot pumpkin flesh in a food processor, along with salt, pepper, and butter to taste.

==Notes, tips and variations==
*If pumpkin is not soft when removed from oven, place back in for 10-15 minutes each time.
*An alternative if you have no food processor is to mash the pumpkin flesh by hand until nearly smooth.

This is a recipe I like to make on the weekend and bring to work with me during the week. I've also prepeared it for friends and family when I want to entertain on a budget (you can feed 5 or 6 people for less than ten dollars!). People consistently ask me for the recipe, which is one I've modified from my family's cajun beans and rice recipe to make it vegan, so I thought it would be a good idea to add to the cookbook.

== Ingredients ==
* 1 package (16 oz.) dry beans (kidney or black beans preferred)
* 1 onion, chopped
* 1 green pepper, chopped
* 1 celery stalk, sliced thin
* 1 bulb garlic, minced
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 tsp. cumin
* 1 tsp. chili powder
* 1 tsp. basil
* olive oil
* salt and pepper, to taste
* optional, 1-2 whole dried or fresh hot peppers
* 1-2 cups rice

== Procedure ==
=== Beans ===
#Soak beans overnight, or, bring to a boil and let sit for one hour.
#In a Dutch oven or large pot, saute onions and garlic in olive oil on medium heat until onions are translucent.
#Add green pepper and celery, and saute for a few minutes more.
#Add beans and enough water to cover all ingredients.
#Add spices, bring to a boil, then lower heat and cover, stirring occasionally until done, (1-2 hours, depending on the age of your beans).

=== Rice ===
#Add rice and twice as much water to pot. (i.e. 1 cup rice =2 cups water, 1 1/2 cups rice = 3 cups water)
#Bring to a rolling boil until the water has boiled down to the level of the rice.
#Reduce heat to a light simmer and cover for 20 min.

Serve the beans over the rice and enjoy!!!
(Also very tasty with [[cornbread]].)

== Notes, tips, and variations ==
*Use canned beans instead of dry. (greatly reduces cooking time, but doesn't allow for the flavor to soak into the beans as well.)
*Use a crockpot.
**Saute vegetables in a skillet, then add all ingredients (except rice) to the crockpot before you leave for work, go to school, whatever. When you come home it's ready!

There are a number of differnet recipes for egg noodles, below are two of the most commonly used ones.

=Recipe 1=
==Ingredients==
*3 [[Cookbook:egg yolk|egg yolk]]s
*1 whole [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] 
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*dash of [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] 
*80ml (1/4 cup) [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
*580ml (2 cups) [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1-2 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Olive oil|olive oil]]

==Procedure==

*In a bowl beat together egg yolks, egg, salt, and pepper.
*Stir in water.
*Stir in flour.
*Knead into ball.
*Roll out on a floured surface until 2 mm to 4 mm (1/16&quot; to 1/8&quot;) thick.
*Cut into noodles 6 mm (1/4&quot;) wide.
*Bring water to a boil in a pot, add oil.
*Add noodles to a boiling water, and cook until done.

=Recipe 2=
==Ingredients==
*4 large [[Cookbook:egg|egg]]s
*400g [[Cookbook:flour|plain flour]]
*Extra flour for kneading

==Procedure==

*Sift the flour onto a large work surface, and create a well in the centre
*Break the eggs into the well
*Slowly draw the flour into the eggs either using a spoon or your hands
*Knead into a smoooth, elastic dough
*Roll to desired thickness, using extra flour  and cut to desired shape
*Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil
*Add the noodles to the water and cook until [[al dente]]

N.B:
*While this recipe says that 400 grams of flour should be sufficient for creating the dough more may be necessary depending upon the size of the eggs
*This recipe usually makes enough noodles for four people, however depending on the shape of pasta more may be needed. A good rule of thumb is one large egg per person.
==Notes==

The homemade noodles made using either recipe can be served with a variety of pasta sauces, such as [[Cookbook:Pesto|pesto]] sauce.

'''Elli's veal or chicken with walnuts''', '''''Gjellë me arra të Ellit''''', is an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian Albanian] dish. 

==Ingredients== 
*2 tablespoons flour
*15 finely crushed shelled walnuts 
*2 beaten egg yolks
*1 minced garlic clove
*1/4 lb. (one stick) butter
*2-3 lbs of veal or chicken meat cut into 1&quot; cubes 

==Procedure==
Place the meat or chicken in a saucepan and cook over medium heat until tender. Remove the meat and set it aside in a dish while leaving the remaining juices in the saucepan. In another saucepan, add the flour and stir over heat until it becomes light brown in color (do not overcook!) and add half the butter. Add the walnuts, garlic, and egg yolks, stirring constantly. Add the juices from the other saucepan and stir until all the ingredients thicken. Immediately remove from the heat to avoid solidifying the egg yolks. Fold in the meat. Pan fry the remaining half stick of butter until brown and pour over the servings. 

Serves 4.

'''Sockerdricka''' (Swedish for &quot;sugar drink&quot;) is a soft drink from the 19th century. It is traditionally a [[Cookbook:Fermentation|fermented]] drink that contains ginger, but modern commercial versions consist of carbonated water, some sugar, and citric acid.

== Ingredients ==
* 20 litres of [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* the peel of one [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]
* 1 kg [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 60 g [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]]
* 25 g [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
* [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]]

== Procedure ==
# Boil the sugar, water, lemon and crushed ginger for 15 minutes. 
# Strain the mixture and let it cool. 
# Mix in the yeast and let the mixture ferment for two days. 
# Put the drink in bottles and add a raisin to each bottle. 

After five days the sockerdricka is ready for drinking.

== Notes, tips and variations ==
* The recipe above has '''lots''' of yeast, and not much ginger. It would work well with just 10g yeast. More ginger would be good, e.g. 100g of fresh ginger for 20 litres.

'''Kroppkakor''' is a traditional Swedish dish: potato [[Cookbook:dumpling|dumplings]] with a filling of pork or bacon. They are cooked and served with butter and [[Cookbook:Lingonberry|lingonberry]] jam. There are some regional variations to the recipe.

== Ingredients == 
* 1 kg cooked potatoes
* 2 egg yolks
* 1 1/4 cup [[Cookbook:flour|all-purpose flour]]
* 1 onion
* 100 g smoked [[Cookbook:ham|ham]]
* 100 g bacon
* salt, pepper
* optional [[Cookbook:allspice|allspice]]

== Preparation ==
# Mash the potatoes. Put this on a breadboard and make a small pit in the middle.
# Put eggs, flour and salt in the pit and work the potato dough fast together. Too much kneading will make the potato tough. 
# Chop the onion finely, cut the bacon and ham into small pieces and fry it until it gets coloured. Flavour it with white pepper.
# Form the dough into a thick roll. Cut it in thick slices and put a pile of bacon mix in a pit in a slice, then put another slice on top of it, press the edges together and roll it into a ball. 
# Lower the balls into boiling salted water and boil them approx. 10-12 minutes or until they float to the surface. Pick them up with a perforated ladle and put them on a hot serving plate. Don’t boil too many at a time, they will then have some difficulty floating to the surface. 
# Serve hot with melted butter and red whortleberry (lingonberry) jam or cranberry jam.

'''Jalebi''' is a syrupy sweet that is shaped like a slightly large, chaotic pretzel and is traditionally prepared in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Pakistan|Pakistan]]. Well-made jalebi has a tart element with a sweet taste.

==Ingredients==
===Jalebi batter===
* 3 cups all-purpose  [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* ¼ cup [[Cookbook:Rice Flour|rice flour]]
* ¼ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* 2 cups water

===Syrup===
* 4 cups [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 3 cups water
* ⅛ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Cream of Tartar|cream of tartar]]
* red and yellow food coloring
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Rosewater|rosewater]]

3 cups of vegetable [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] for deep frying

==Procedure==
# Mix up the batter ingredients until smooth.
# Let the batter sit unrefrigerated and uncovered overnight (about 12 hours).
# Mix the sugar, water, and cream of tartar for the syrup.
# Stir the syrup over moderate heat until the sugar is dissolved.
# Put on high heat and boil for 5 minutes. 
# Let the syrup cool, and stir in the rosewater and food coloring (color it to light orange).
# Put the vegetable oil in a wide [[Cookbook:Wok|wok]]-like dish, and heat to about 350°F (175°C).
# Put the batter into a pastry bag with about a ¼ inch opening. If it is too dry to squeeze out, mix in a bit of water.
# Squeeze the batter into the oil, making a couple of figure 8s and loops on top of each other. The shape should be about 3 inches on its longest side.
# Fry each jalebi until golden brown. Remove, let the oil drain off, then soak in syrup for a minute.

Serves 7.

'''Choucroute Garnie''' Sauerkraut with sausages, salt pork and potatoes.

Being a little picky about your ingredients (especially the sauerkraut) with this recipe makes all the difference.

==Ingredients==
*1 or so [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] of [[Cookbook:Duck|duck]] [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]]
*1 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], finely chopped
*2 or 3 small [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]
*5 [[Cookbook:Juniper Berry|juniper berries]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Clove|clove]]
*1 or 2 [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] cloves
*1 or so tablespoons of [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander seed]]
*1/2 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Mustard|black mustard seed]]
*2 strips of [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]], sliced (or the same amount of salted [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] belly) into rough squares
*1 pound of [[Cookbook:Sauerkraut|sauerkraut]]
*4 pork [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausages]]
*3 smoked pork slices, bone in
*1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (240ml) or so of [[Cookbook:White Wine|white wine]] (dry)

==Procedure==
#In a [[Cookbook:Pots and Pans|pot]] large enough to in the end hold everything, melt the duck fat over medium heat.
#When hot, add the onions and [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sauté]] until translucent (about five minutes or so).
#Then, add the sauerkraut, white wine, juniper berries, clove, coriander seed, mustard seed, and garlic.
#Add the smoked pork and bacon.
#Cover, and then [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]] for about two hours.
#In other pot, simmer two peeled potatoes and your sausages (not a boil, or your sausages will split open).
#Simmer until potatoes are done (and by then the sausage will be, too).
#Serve in a heap-- sauerkraut at the bottom, various [[Cookbook:Pork|pig]] and potato parts on top. This is delicious.

'''Albanian vegetable pie''', '''''Byrek Shqipëtar me perime''''', is an [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Albania|Albania]]n recipe for cooking pies. Albanian pies are generally made of thin pastry leaves which can be rolled out at home or bought as [[Cookbook:Filo Dough|filo dough]] at a supermarket. Most of the pies prepared by Albanian cooks are not sweet; instead, pie fillings are almost always savory. Thus, a piece of such a pie may well serve as the main dish of a meal.

== Ingredients ==
*1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (240 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]], preferably [[Cookbook:Olive_Oil|olive oil]]
*1½ packets (or about 30) pastry leaves (filo dough)
*1½ [[Cookbook:Pound|pounds]] (680 [[Cookbook:g|g]]) spinach, chopped
*1 cup (240 mL) diced [[Cookbook:Feta Cheese|feta cheese]]
*½ cup (120 mL) chopped green [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]]
*2-3 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
*1½ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|t]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

== Procedure ==
A medium-sized, round baking pan is recommended because it's more authentic, but any medium-sized baking pan will do.

Brush the baking pan with some of the oil, and start laying the pastry leaves inside. First, lay two leaves, sprinkle or brush with oil, then lay two more leaves, and repeat the procedure until half of the leaves are in place. Make sure that they cover the pan by hanging them about one inch over the edges of the pan.

Sprinkle spinach with salt, then mix well by hand. Add the feta cheese, oil, onions, eggs and salt, and spread this mixture over the already laid pastry leaves. Finish by covering the spinach with the rest of the pastry leaves, repeating the first-half procedure and then roll the hanging edges of the bottom leaves over the pie (think of a [[Cookbook:Pizza|pizza]] crust), sprinkle top with oil and bake moderately at [[Cookbook:Oven temperatures|350°F (175°C)]] for about 45 minutes, or until golden brown. Serve hot, accompanied with [[Cookbook:Buttermilk|buttermilk]], or beaten [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]], thinned down in cold water or with chilled [[Cookbook:Stewed Prunes|stewed prunes]]. Sometimes a green [[Cookbook:Salad|salad]] adds to the meal!

Serves 4-6.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Lebanon|Cuisine of Lebanon]]

== Ingredients ==

* For the Chicken
** 4 x Skin-on, boned [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] breasts
** 2 [[Cookbook:Lemon|Lemons]] completely juiced (use fresh lemons!)
** 6 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
** 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]]
** 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Pepper|Pepper]]
** 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Basil|Basil]]
** ¼ tsp [[Cookbook:Cayenne pepper|Cayenne Pepper]]
** 6 large [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] sliced in ¼&quot; slices

* For the '[[Cookbook:Toum|toom]]' (Arabic for garlic)
** 4 cloves of garlic
** ½ cup [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
** ¼ cup [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]
** ¼ tsp salt
** a dash of cayenne.

== Instructions ==
# Blend the lemon juice, garlic, salt, pepper, basil and cayenne pepper to make the marinade. 
# Put the chicken breasts in a deep pan and pour the marinade over it
# Cover and sit all night.  In the morning, flip the chicken to the other side.
# At noon drain the liquid from the pan and cook in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for 10-15 minutes (not to cook, only to brown)
# Once finished, pour the marinade over the browned chicken, tightly cover the pan with tin foil (don't burn your fingers) and put back in the oven.  Set the oven to 250°F (120°C)
# Baste at 1pm, 2pm and 3pm.
# At 4pm, add the sliced potatoes to the pot, baste everything, and recover with tin foil.
# Put back in the oven for another hour.
# Once the above step is finished, blend all of the ingredients for the toom together.

At 5pm, dinner's ready.

The trick is not in complicated ingredients - it is the slow cooking and lemon/garlic marinade.  

Use the toom as a condiment for the chicken and potatoes.

Serve with warm pita bread.

'''Cheese on toast''' - a simple concept but easy to get wrong. Thick cut [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] is your first requirement. Toast one side of it under a medium [[Cookbook:Grilling|grill]]. While it's browning, grate some cheese. You need a firm fleshed, strong flavoured cheese. Lightly toast the other side of the bread, just enough to warm it, then spread the grated cheese over it. You can add pickles, finely chopped onion, or even some crushed walnuts at this stage. Grill the cheesy side of the bread until the cheese is bubbling and brown. Eat quickly, but be careful, as the cheese will be tongue-burningly hot!

'''Frappé coffee''' is a refreshing drink of Greek origin, perfect on a summer's day.

== Ingredients ==
*1-2 spoons of instant coffee
*Tall Glass of Cold Water
*1-3 spoons of sugar (optional)
*3-5 ice cubes (optional)
*Milk (optional; condensed/evaporated milk works best)

== Procedure ==
Put coffee and sugar in a shaker or tall glass and add cold water as high as it covers the mixture. Shake or stir with mixer until the mixture becomes foamy. Add cold water to fill the glass, ice cubes and as much milk (preferably evaporated or condensed milk) as you like. Drink with a straw.

== Types ==

* Ratio Sugar:Coffee &gt;2:1  Frappé ''glykos''  (Sweet Frappé)
* Ratio Sugar:Coffee  1:1  Frappé ''metrios'' (Medium or Moderate Frappé)
* No sugar                 Frappé ''sketos''

Either of the above with milk added ''me gala'' (with milk),  e.g. ''Frappé glykos me gala'' or ''Frapogalo''

== Notes, tips and variations ==
* You can also add Baileys or a ball of ice cream.
* Once I was in Greece I was told that the right order of mixing Frappe after making foam is ICE, MILK and than fill up the glass with  cold WATER.
* By including the ICE when shaking or stirring the coffee, it allows the foam to become more aerated and frothier. Once this has been done, you can then top up with water and/or milk.

'''Melanzane Parmigiana''' is generally an oven baked dish consisting of aubergine, Parmesan cheese, mozzarella and tomato sauce.

==Ingredients==

* 3 or 4 big [[Cookbook:Eggplant|eggplants]] (aubergines)
* [[Cookbook:Tomato Sauce|tomato sauce]]
* about 200 or 300 [[Cookbook:gram|grams]] of [[Cookbook:Mozzarella Cheese|mozzarella cheese]], sliced
* grated [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan cheese]]
* [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] to [[Cookbook:Frying|fry]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

;Optional:
* fresh [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Hard Boiled Eggs|boiled eggs]]

==Procedure==

#Wash eggplants and cut them in slices about 1-1.5 [[Cookbook:Centimetre (cm)|cm]] thick. Eggplant has a bitter taste and it should be prepared in the following way to remove this: 
##Salt each slice on both sides and put them on a big plate.
##When all the slices are covered with salt, cover them with another plate, pressing a bit.
##Let them rest for 20-30 minutes or more, time permitting (up to 2 hours).
##Then wash the slices under running water and let them dry a while.
##Alternatively, place salted eggplant slices in a large strainer and place a weight (e.g. a smaller pot of water) on top to help squeeze out the water.
#Dust the slices with flour and/or bread crumbs and fry them. Do not overcook, as they will spend some time in the oven later.
#Take a pan for the oven and make a layer with eggplants slices, then one with the tomato sauce, then one with some slices of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Some cooks add fresh basil leaves and cooked egg slices.  
#Make as many layers as you wish, but 3 or 4 should be enough. Be sure the last one to be completely full of Parmesan cheese, that will make a nice crust when cooked.
#Now everything is finished, put the pan in the oven at [[Cookbook:Oven temperatures|180°C (350°F)]] for about 20-30 minutes.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Sandwiches|Sandwich]]

A ''''po' boy'''' (from the name &quot;poor boy,&quot; as the sandwiches were traditionally given to the poor street boys by the nuns in New Orleans) is a New Orleans sandwich similar to a &quot;sub&quot; sandwich. They can be made with anything, but are typically made with a type of meat and &quot;dressing&quot; (lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and sauce). Mother's Restaurant in New Orleans is well-known for their debris po' boy, made with the &quot;debris&quot; from a roast that falls into gravy when a roast is cut. 

==Ingredients==
* [[Cookbook:Bread|French bread]]
* Thinly sliced meat ([[Cookbook:Ham|ham]], [[Cookbook:Turkey|turkey]], [[Cookbook:Beef|roast beef]], etc.), fried seafood ([[Cookbook:Shrimp|shrimp]], [[Cookbook:Oyster|oysters]], [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]], etc.), etc. 
* [[Cookbook:Lettuce|Lettuce]], [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], pickles, etc.
* Sliced [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]] 
* [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|Mayonnaise]], [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]], [[Cookbook:Sauces|gravy]], etc.

==Procedure==
# Slice the bread along one side so that it folds open like a book.
# Open the bread and add the cheese, shredded lettuce, and meat.
# Add condiments to your liking.
# Close the bread (as you would a book) and mash it down.

{{recipe}}

This recipe for the deep fried Mars bar illustrates a typical procedure. The ingredients in the dish's variations may vary indefinitely, but the procedure will remain more or less the same. For authentic flavor, fry the treat in  [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] drippings rather than vegetable oil (it is worth warning of the high saturated fat content this method of cooking produces).

==Ingredients==

*1 UK or Canadian [[w:Mars_Bar|Mars Bar]] or 1 US [[w:Milky_Way%20(confectionery)|Milky Way Bar]] (same thing, w/ caramel but no nuts)
*1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] 
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Oil|oil or fat]] (use [[Cookbook:Suet|suet]] for authenticity)

==Procedure==

[[Cookbook:Chill|Chill]], but do not [[Cookbook:Freeze|freeze]], the Mars bar by leaving it in a fridge, or freezer, for a short while. Mix the milk, flour and egg in a bowl. [[Cookbook:Whisk|Whisk]] together to create a creamy [[Cookbook:Batter|batter]]. Heat the oil. Coat the Mars bar completely in batter. Lower into hot oil and fry until batter is golden brown. Serve.

==Ingredients==

*10 oz - Plain white flour;
*6 oz - Wholemeal flour;
*1 3/4 lvl tsp - Bread soda;
*2 heaped dessert spoons - Wheat germ;
*1 lvl tsp - Salt;
*7/8 pint - Buttermilk.

==Method==

# Grease and flour an 8 inch round baking tin.
# Sift the white flour into a large mixing bowl.
# Add the other dry ingredients and mix thoroughly.
''A simple tip: Sift the flour and baking soda five times through a sieve. This ensures even mixing of the ingredients and gives a better result.''
# Make a well in the centre of the bowl, pour in some of the buttermilk and, with a wooden spoon, gradually mix the flour into the buttermilk. Alternatively, make a volcano shape on a marble slab with the dry ingredients, add the buttermilk and mix with a knife.
# Add more buttermilk and mix in more flour.  Continue until the flour is completely absorbed into the mix.  The mix should not be over saturated, but have a slightly stretchy look.
''Handle it as little as possible. You can also ball it up into one or two balls, place them on a flat baking tray, and cut a cross in the top.''
# Turn the mix into the baking tin and place in a medium hot oven (180 degrees Centigrade, 350 degrees F) for 35 to 45 minutes, or until golden brown.  
# Leave to cool on a wire tray.

Mayonnaise is a smooth savoury [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce]] made from [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] and the yolk of [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]. It is an emulsion in which the oil is dispersed in tiny droplets.
Egg yolk contains lecithin which prevents the oil and water from separating out. [[Cookbook:Mustard|Mustard]] is also a good emulsifier and is frequently added. [[Cookbook:Vinegar|Vinegar]], usually wine vinegar, or [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]] juice are added for flavour and because acidity is necessary for the emulsion to properly form. [[Cookbook:Garlic|Garlic]] is a frequent addition.
The [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] used is normally a flavourless type such as [[Cookbook:Sunflower Oil|sunflower oil]] or [[Cookbook:Corn Oil|corn oil]], but you can substitute some for a stronger tasting oil such as [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]. 

Mayonnaise is notoriously difficult for the beginner, as it often curdles, but easy once you have the knack. 

==Ingredients==
*1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] yolk
*2 1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] (12.5 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]] and/or [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
*1/2 teaspoons (2.5 mL) Dijon [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]]
*1/4 teaspoons (1 mL) [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*3/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (180mL) [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]

==Procedure==
# In a large bowl, beat the egg yolk with a wire [[Cookbook:Whisk|whisk]] for about a minute. 
# Then add the mustard, sugar, salt, and half the lemon juice. Whisk for another minute - the mixture should thicken very slightly.
# Then, very slowly, add half the oil with one hand whilst whisking with the other. 
# Start drop by drop, incorporating each drop before adding the next, and build up to a trickle.
# Keep going until the oil is whisked in.
# Add the rest of the lemon juice, whisk to combine.
# Add the rest of the oil in the same manner as before.
# Keep going until all the oil is whisked in. 

You can now stir flavourings such as crushed garlic into the finished mayonnaise, or use the mayonnaise as a base for other sauces.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* One can make the whisking process easier by using a kitchen towel.  Wet a kitchen towel, or any small towel, until it is very wet and heavy, but not dripping.  Coil the towel on top of a flat surface, such as the kitchen countertop or a table. Place the bowl onto the circle.  This will provide a steady base for the bowl and allow you to whisk with one hand while adding ingredients with the other.

* If the mayonnaise should curdle, it can be recovered by slowly dripping the curdled mayonnaise into another egg yolk while whisking vigorously all the time.

* ½ teaspoons [[Cookbook:White sugar|white sugar]] can be added for those with a sweet tooth.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Dessert|Dessert]] | [[Cookbook:Cake|Cake]]

This low-fat cake recipe is very common with unique variations.  The cake is simple to make and does not require you to start from scratch.  All the ingredients can be found at your local grocery stores.  

==Cake==
*  One box of yellow cake mix (approximately 1 lb. &amp; 2.25 ounces or 517 grams)
*  One 11 ounce (312 grams) can of mandarin oranges
*  Three medium size eggs

Preheat oven to 350 degree Fahrenheit.  If using non-stick baking pans, still need to grease sides and bottom with shortening and cover surface lightly with flour.  Pour yellow cake mix into mixing bowl.  Add eggs and mandarin oranges (including its juice).  Do not need to add oil, margarine, or butter.  Blend until moistened and beat for approximately 2 minutes at medium speed.  Pour mix evenly into baking pans.  Bake approximately 30 minutes or per cake mix instruction (inserted toothpick into center comes out clean).  Remove from oven and let the cakes cool.

==Icing==
*  One box of '''instant''' vanilla pudding mix (5.1 ounces or 144 grams)
*  One 20 ounce (567 grams) can of crushed pineapples
*  One 12 ounce (340 grams) container of CoolWhip, found in the frozen section

Scoop CoolWhip into a clean mixing bowl.  Add the instant vanilla pudding mix.  Drain all the pineapple juice from the can of crushed pineapples and fold into CoolWhip.  Mix all the ingredients evenly, do not use a blender.  For better results, chill icing for about 30 minutes.

After the cake cools, frost each layer with your icing.  Each serving is approximately 275 calories with about 4 to 5 grams of fat.  Like everything else, moderation is always best.

'''Oil-dumpling''' (in Dutch: Oliebol, oliebollen)

Oliebollen are oftentimes called Dutch apple fritters, and are served at Dutch festivals in the United States, such as Oak Harbor, Washington's Holland Happening Festival.

Makes: 50 doughnuts, or 1 roaster pan full

== Ingredients ==
* 2 tbsp [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 2 pkg [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 5 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* 2 cups [[Cookbook:Scalding|scalded]] [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* ½ cup [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]], softened
* 10 cups [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1½ tsp [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 3 diced Granny Smith [[Cookbook:Apple|apples]]
* 3 cups [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]] (optional)
* [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|ground cinnamon]] to taste
* [[Cookbook:Canola Oil|canola oil]] for frying

== Instructions ==
# Dissolve 2 tbsp sugar in 1 cup warm water. Sprinkle yeast on top. Let stand while preparing dough.
# In a LARGE mixing bowl, beat eggs until mixed. Add scalded milk, 1½ cups warm water, yeast mixture and margarine and beat well. Add flour, 1 cup sugar and salt, mix well. Add diced apple.
# Let dough rise in a warm place until doubled in size. (I use a lobster pot for this)
# In a separate bowl, mix 3 C. sugar and cinnamon to taste. (I like a LOT)
# Fill a fryer pot 4 inches with canola oil or melted Crisco. Heat to 375°F (190°C) and scoop large spoonfuls of dough into the pot, turning them to ensure even browning. (Golden brown is the goal) Play the shape game while you're at it.  Dipping the spoons in the hot oil before scooping the dough keeps the spoons from getting too sticky.
# Drain on paper towels on paper bags, roll in cinnamon sugar mixture and serve warm.

'''If''' you are &lt;u&gt;inexperienced&lt;/u&gt; with cannabis and use a CUP as in this recipe then expect to consider ringing an ambulance at some point; you probably won't ring one but you will think about it, and possibly consider whether, in retrospect, maybe you should have.  

At the very least you will experience what is known as a &quot;whitey&quot; in certain parts, referring of course to the skin pallour assumed by the protagonist...accompanied by heart racing, sweats and general &quot;oh god I feel weird, no.. ''really'' weird, maybe I should ring an ambulance..&quot; type-comments.  

I would suggest a teaspoon for a novice and certainly not a cup, if you can handle it then work your way 'up' from gentle not 'down' from psychotic.  

Another plan might be to just forget the whole thing and have a nice cup of tea and an early night instead.

'''Poutine''' is common dish throughout the Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic regions of Canada which is made up of three items: beef [[Cookbook:Gravy|gravy]], [[Cookbook:French Fries|French fries]] and [[Cookbook:Cheese Curds|cheese curds]].

==Deep fried poutine==
This recipe uses pre-canned gravy and fries the potatoes from scratch.

===Ingredients===
*1 [[Cookbook:L|L]] of vegetable oil for [[Cookbook:Deep Fat Frying|deep frying]]
*1 (290 [[Cookbook:g|g]]) can of beef gravy
*5 medium [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]
*2 cups (500 [[Cookbook:ML|mL]]) of [[Cookbook:Cheddar Cheese|cheddar]] cheese curds

===Equipment===
*1 Deep fat fryer or large stove pot to fry the potatoes
*1 saucepan or cup suitable for warming gravy
*1 Serving dish

===Procedure===
# Slice potatoes into finger-width wedges and rinse them well to remove any dirt
# Begin warming gravy, keep the temperature low enough for a slow heating
# Heat oil to 185°C (365°F)
# Cook wedges in the oil, this should take about 5 minutes
# Remove the fries from the oil and place them on a paper towel mat, to absorb excess oil
# Mix the wedges and cheese curds
# Pour the gravy over the top and wait until the cheese starts to melt
* Et Voila! Vous avez une poutine.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
* Changing the cheese and gravy used in poutine completely changes the dynamic of the dish, a popular variant is to use a chicken or turkey based gravy with [[Cookbook:Mozzarella Cheese|mozzarella cheese]] instead of curds.

* Replacing gravy with [[Cookbook:Salsa | salsa]], the cheese curds with [[Cookbook:Sour Cream | sour cream]], adding diced onions and tomatoes turns poutine into mexipoutine, an item also carried by the likes of Taco Bell under the name &quot;Fries Supreme&quot;.

* Replacing the gravy with [[Cookbook:Marinara Sauce | marinara sauce]], adding either loose lean ground beef or crumbled sausage and replacing the cheese curds with [[Cookbook:Mozzarella Cheese|mozzarella cheese]] changes the dish to poutine Italiano, not as popular as the mexipoutine alternative, but used in several fast food restaurants in Toronto, Ontario.

==Warnings==
This dish is considered rather unhealthy; don't eat it on a regular basis.

==Ingredients==

* ground or finely chopped [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]
* [[Cookbook:Tortilla|corn tortillas]] or ready-made taco shells
* [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]]. ''about 1 to 4 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] per [[Cookbook:Pound|pound]] of beef (perhaps 11 to 44 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]/[[Cookbook:kg|kg]])''
* [[Cookbook:Black Olive|black olives]]
* shredded mild [[Cookbook:Cheddar Cheese|cheddar cheese]]
* fresh [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]

Optional ingredients include:
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]. ''helpful if spices need to be ground''
* [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]]. ''to be added to the beef''
* [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]]. ''raw, lightly cooked, or well-cooked''
* [[Cookbook:Alfalfa|alfalfa]] sprouts
* fresh [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]]
* inflammatory agents. ''[[Cookbook:Habanero|habaneros]], [[Cookbook:Jalapeño|jalapeños]], etc.''
* [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]]

==Procedure==
#Chop the black olives.
#Slice the fresh tomatoes, optionally discarding the gooey parts.
#Place the olives, tomatoes, and cheese in the eating area. These toppings will need to be ready to use when the taco shells are hot.
#Place the beef in a wide pan on a large burner. Ground beef will need to be broken up as it cooks; chopped beef needs to be stir-fried and may require oil. When using high-fat ground beef you may wish to: add water to float the fat, cool to solidify the fat, remove the fat, drain the water, and reheat.
#Add lots of cumin to the beef. Cumin is the magic ingredient that makes a taco taste like a taco. You may also add cilantro, celery, or mushrooms.
#Prepare the shells. Pre-made shells should be proped up on each other and/or on cardboard, then heated in the oven. Do not brown them. Plain corn tortilias need to be fried. You may use a [[Cookbook:Deep Fat Frying|deep-fat]] process, going one at a time and using a large spoon to form the shells into the normal U shape. Pan frying in 1/4 inch to 1/2 inch of oil will also work; be sure not to let the tortilias stiffen prior to being bent into the normal U shape.
#Place hot beef into a taco. To avoid cracks, it is important to do this first when using pre-made shells. The heat and moisture of the beef will soften up the bottom of the taco just enough to prevent cracking.
#Place cheese onto the beef. The heat of the beef should slightly melt the cheese. You may wish to microwave the taco a bit, especially if the cheese is cold or if you are using low-fat cheese.
#Place chopped olives, tomatoes, and any other vegatables onto the cheese.

==Variation==
The beef and taco shell may be cooked together in a deep fat fryer. For this, you will need to use plain uncooked corn tortilas and finely shredded or shaved beef. Wrap the beef in the tortilla, making a tube shape with enough air space to let hot oil get in. You must ensure that the beef gets properly cooked. You may wish to start from partially cooked and hot beef for safety. With the beef, you may include any vegetables that are tolerant of high heat. Serve these rolled tacos side-by-side on a plate with the heat-sensitive ingredients simply placed on top. Consider pre-melting the cheese.

==Variation==
Tacos, [[Cookbook:Egg Roll|egg rolls]], and [[Cookbook:Tamale|tamales]] have similar construction. The fillings and shells can be interchanged as desired.

'''Apple Crisp''' is a [[Cookbook:Dessert|dessert]] made up of a [[Cookbook:Baking|baked]] [[Cookbook:Apple|apple]] filling and a crispy crumb topping. It is similar to '''[[Cookbook:Cobbler|cobbler]]''', which has a [[Cookbook:Biscuit|biscuit]]-like ([[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|USA]] biscuit that is) or [[Cookbook:Cake|cake]]-like topping. Cool room temperature is required to create a nice crisp topping. To serve '''Apple Crisp''', spoon it into a bowl and, optionally, add [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] [[Cookbook:Vanilla Ice Cream|ice cream]]. '''Apple Crisp''' also goes well with a glass of [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]].

==Ingredients==
*6 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] sliced and cored [[Cookbook:Apple|baking apples]] (for example, Granny Smith)
*1/2 cup (100g) all-purpose [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1/2 cup (100g) [[Cookbook:rolled oats|rolled oats]]
*3/4 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] (3g) [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*1/3 cup (75g) cold [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or cold [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
*2/3 to 3/4 cup (120-150g)  [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]]

==Procedure==
#In a medium bowl stir together flour, brown sugar, and oatmeal. If the room temperature is a bit warm, you should cool this mixture.
#Prepare the apples. This should be completed before mixing butter into the topping. It is helpful to choose apples that do not brown quickly; Granny Smith apples are a good choice. Do not use Red Delicious apples; they turn to mush. Place the apples into a 9-inch square baking dish; glass is best.
#Add the butter or margarine to the topping. Mix it via a slicing action, so that the butter or margarine forms tiny little chunks and does not melt or smear. A pair of butter knives, used like scissors, is good for this. You must work quickly once you start this step.
#Sprinkle the filling onto the apples. You may pat it down just a bit.
#Bake for about 30 minutes in a [[Cookbook:Oven temperatures|375°F]] oven. Do not remove the crisp before the top is dark brown. Black spots indicate burning. It is better to burn a few small spots, which you can then remove, than to risk undercooking the topping.


== Alternate Recipe ==
* 4 cups apples, sliced 
* 1 Tablespoon lemon juice 
* 1/3 cup flour 
* 1/2 cup brown sugar 
* 1 cup rolled oats 
* 1/2 teaspoon salt 
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon 
* 1/4 cup melted margarine or butter 

Put apples in shallow 8 inch pan. Sprinkle with lemon juice. Combine all dry ingredients with butter and mix until crumbly. Sprinkle all this over apples and bake at 375 degrees for 30 minutes.

Serves: 8

==Other Alternate Recipe==
* 5 cups of apples&lt;br&gt;
* 3/4 cup brown sugar&lt;br&gt;
* 3/4 cup oats&lt;br&gt;
* 1/2 cup flour&lt;br&gt;
* 1/4 pound butter&lt;br&gt;
* 1 tsp cinnamon&lt;br&gt;
* 1/2 tsp salt&lt;br&gt;
* lemon to taste&lt;br&gt;
* 1/3 cup water&lt;br&gt;
* 1/4 tsp nutmeg&lt;br&gt;

Preheat a conventional oven to 350° Fahrenheit / 180° Celsius. Thinly slice the apples and place them in a buttered pan, and sprinkle them with lemon for flavor and to prevent them from turning brown. Peeling the apples is traditional, but not required. Add 1/3 cup of water and cinnamon to taste.&lt;br&gt;
Meanwhile, to make the topping combine the butter, sugar, oats, flour, cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg, and crumble the ingredients in a bowl with your fingers to create a uniform mixture. 
Cover the apples with the topping and bake for 30-45 minutes or until the apples are soft and the topping is crisped. Serve with ice cream or whipped cream. Loose oats can be sprinkled sparingly on the surface of the topping before baking for added texture.


==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Any type of apple may be used, baking or sweet, or a mixture of types.
*Cooked apple dishes are a good use for substandard apples, eg damaged, wrinkled &amp; windfall.
*Crisps can be made with most any sort of fruit. [[Cookbook:Pineapple|Pineapple]] is a good choice.
*Some fruits, especially peaches, go better in a [[Cookbook:Cobbler|cobbler]].
*Raisins can be added to the apples at the beginning, and 1/2 teaspoon of powdered ginger, or a sprinkling of nutmeg can also be put in.
*'Mixed spice' (cinnamon, coriander, clove &amp; other spices) is a perfect addition to apple dishes. This is more popular in Britain than the US.

'''Strudel''' - I learnt this version from my exchange hosts in Germany. Serve warm with ice cream.

==Ingredients==
*4 fresh apples, preferably red. 
*1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon  
*1/2 cup sultanas and raisin mix
*2 tablespoons white sugar
*1/2 cup melted butter
*filo pastry sheets 

==Procedure==
#Preheat oven to 200 degrees Celsius. 
#Peel, core and cube apples. 
#Combine apples, sultanas, raisins, cinnamon and sugar. Mix well. 
#Generously brush filo pastry sheets with butter. 
#Spread apple mixture over pastry sheet. 
#Alternate with two layers of filo pastry for every layer of apple mixture. 
#Brush with melted butter. 
#Bake for 30 minutes or until pastry is golden brown. 

==Notes, tips and variations==
*For more tartness, substitute for 3 red apples and 1 green apple.
*If you are unable to obtain ground cinnamon, substitute for cinnamon powder.

This is a simple sweet-and-sour dish that works well as an everyday meal, even with leftover meat. It is best served with [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]], and perhaps also [[Cookbook:Steaming|steamed]] [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]]. The [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce]] alone (no [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]], [[Cookbook:Cherry|cherries]], or [[Cookbook:Pineapple|pineapple]] chunks) can be poured over rice or used as a dip for [[Cookbook:Egg Roll|egg rolls]].

==Ingredients==

* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]]
* 1/3 cup red wine [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]
* 20 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounce]] (567 [[Cookbook:g|g]]) can of [[Cookbook:Pineapple|pineapple]] chunks in unsweetened juice
* maraschino [[Cookbook:Cherry|cherries]]
* cooked meat (suggested: [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] or [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]])
* [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]]

==Procedure==

#Mix the brown sugar and corn starch.
#Add the vinegar, soy sauce, and most of the pineapple juice
#Heat to boiling while stirring constantly
#Reduce heat
#Add pre-cooked meat, pineapple chunks, cherries, and celery
#Cook until celery begins to soften

This is a rich non-greasy [[Cookbook:Frosting|frosting]] that goes on hot and stiffens as it cools.

==Ingredients==

* 5 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Confectioners'_sugar|powdered sugar]]
* 3 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounces]] unsweetened [[Cookbook:Baking Chocolate|baking chocolate]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] extract
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Corn_syrup|corn syrup]]

==Procedure==

#Melt the chocolate and margarine together in a double-boiler or, carefully, in a saucepan on low heat.
#Mix in the vanilla extract and corn syrup, keeping the mixture somewhat hot.
#Mix in the sugar, still keeping the mixture somewhat hot. You might not use exactly 5 cups. Just keep adding sugar until the frosting is as thick as desired.
#While still hot, spread the mixture on cake or [[Cookbook:Brownies|brownies]].
#Mixture will stiffen.

==Warnings==
Steaming hot [[Cookbook:Cake|cake]] will release moisture which may collect under a frosting. Cold cake may cause a frosting to stiffen prematurely. Thus, you should use a warm cake.

==Tip==
A very small amount of [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] may be added if the mixture is unspreadable even while hot. Don't add more than you truly need.

'''Egg rolls''' have very little [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] in them. Egg roll filling is essentially [[Cookbook:Stir-fry|stir-fry]], but with smaller particles and less cooking. It goes hot into an egg roll wrapper, which is then cooked in a hot [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]. Egg rolls may be eaten plain or dipped in [[Cookbook:Sweet and Sour|sweet-and-sour]] sauce or [[Cookbook:Teriyaki Sauce|teriyaki]] sauce.

Egg rolls keep about as well as any other fried food - not well at all. The filling alone will keep well. Leftover filling and wrappers may be used to make [[Cookbook:Wonton Soup|wonton soup]]. Leftover wrappers may be deep-fried alone, then immediately covered in [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] and [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]].

Note that these egg rolls do not contain [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]] and [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]], which are used by commercial egg roll producers to cheapen the filling. The filling in these egg rolls is superior.

==Ingredients==

* egg roll wrappers (easiest bought ready-to-use, but see the [[Cookbook:Wonton Wrapper|wonton wrapper recipe]])
* [[Cookbook:Meat and poultry|meat or poultry]] (suggested: [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] or [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]])
* [[Cookbook:Bok Choy|bok choy]], or [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]] and perhaps [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]]
* [[Cookbook:Broccoli|broccoli]] (optional)
* [[Cookbook:Bean sprouts|bean sprouts]]
* powdered [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
* [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]
* [[Cookbook:Bamboo Shoot|bamboo shoots]]
* [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] to [[Cookbook:Frying|fry]] the filling, possibly including [[Cookbook:Sesame Oil|sesame oil]]
* oil to fry the finished rolls, possibly including [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]]
* [[Cookbook:egg white|egg white]]

==Procedure==

===Filling===
#Cut the meat into tiny pieces. This is much easier to do if the meat is cooked, but the result will be better if you cut the meat raw and cook it after cutting.
#Cut the bamboo shoots into matchsticks.
#Chop the broccoli head into little pieces, perhaps 3/8-inch diameter. Cut the stalk into matchsticks.
#If using celery, cut the stalks lengthwise into 3/4-inch wide pieces and then crosswise into 1/8-inch slices.
#If using bok choy, cut the leaves away from the stalk. Treat the stalks as celery. Cut the leaves crosswise in 1/2-inch strips, then break the strips into 1.5-inch pieces.
#If using spinach, treat it much like the bok choy leaves.
#Wash the bean sprouts, discarding any that are not white and crisp.
#Place oil in a [[Cookbook:Wok|wok]] and turn on the heat. High temperatures can produce a better result, but require rapid stirring to prevent burning. Beginners should use lower temperatures. Split the cooking into batches as needed to ensure that your wok is not too full; there should be plenty of room to stir and toss the food in your wok. You may prefer to cook each ingredient separately, then mix them at the end.
#Add the meat. If it is uncooked, lightly [[Cookbook:Stir-frying|stir-fry]] it now. Drain juices and add more oil as needed.
#You may add a small amount of sesame seed oil and/or [[Cookbook:Sesame Seed|sesame seeds]] for flavor.
#Add soy sauce. For a typical wok full of food, add a [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]].
#Add ginger. About 1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] of ginger should be right, depending on taste. Ginger is somewhat hot.
#Add the broccoli, celery, and/or bok choy stalks. When done, they should be just slightly softened. Broccoli should end up being very bright green, losing the bluish cast but not gaining any hint of a yellow-brown cast.
#Add bok choy leaves and/or spinach. When done, they should be just barely wilted.
#Add the bamboo shoots and bean sprouts, and turn off the heat. Do not overcook the bean sprouts.

===Construction and frying===
#Begin heating oil to fry the egg rolls. [[Cookbook:Deep Fat Fry|Deep-fat frying]] works best, though [[Cookbook:Pan fry|pan frying]] in 3/4-inch of oil will also work. You will not need a basket; egg rolls may stick to a basket and rip. You will need [[Cookbook:Tongs|tongs]].
#Place an egg roll wrapper on a plate. Beginners may use [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] to help avoid sticking, but this will quickly foul the oil.
#Turn the plate so that the wrapper has one point toward you and one point away from you.
#Place some hot filling on the wrapper.
#Fold over the corner that faces away from you.
#Paint some egg white onto this corner to act as glue.
#Fold over the left-facing and right-facing corners.
#Paint some egg white onto these parts also, and also onto the remaining corner.
#Roll the egg roll toward you, onto the remaining corner of the wrapper.
#Examine the wrapper to ensure that it is fully sealed. Tears may be patched up with pieces from a spare wrapper and some egg white glue.
#Place the egg roll into the hot oil. You may be able to cook several at once, but do not allow the uncooked egg rolls to sit for long. Egg rolls that sit uncooked will become sticky and easy to tear.
#Turn the egg rolls over a few times as they cook, and dunk them under the oil. Be sure not to break them open as you do this.
#Remove the egg rolls when they are golden brown. Place them onto a fresh plate, so that they do not become contaminated with raw egg whites. Be sure to not handle the cooked egg rolls with hands that may be contaminated with raw egg whites.
#Serve quickly; they are best eaten hot.

==Warning==
When a pot of hot oil catches fire, the flames will reach up for 2 or 3 feet. If you must work under flammable cabinets or shelves, be sure to have a fire extinguisher handy. An oil with a high [[Cookbook:Smoke Point|smoke point]] is less likely to cause problems, including indoor air pollution and fire. Do not use water to extinguish an oil fire.

==Variation==
Egg rolls, [[Cookbook:Taco|tacos]], and [[Cookbook:Tamale|tamales]] have similar construction. The fillings and shells can be interchanged as desired.

This is a simple fried rice dish that works well as an everyday meal.

==Ingredients==

* lots of [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]]
* water
* [[Cookbook:Bean Sprout|bean sprouts]]
* [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
* [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]
* [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]] or [[Cookbook:Bok Choy|bok choy]]

==Procedure==

#Cook rice as you normally would, but skimp on the water. The rice should not be sticky or crunchy. It may help to let the cooked rice sit overnight in the refrigerator.
#Wash the bean sprouts. Discard any that are not white and crunchy.
#If using bok choy, separate the stalk part from the leaf part. Slice the leaf part crosswise into 3/4-inch-thick strips, then tear the strips into 2-inch pieces. These pieces will be treated much like the bean sprouts, though perhaps with slightly more cooking. The stalk part will be treated as celery.
#Slice the celery or bok choy stalk crosswise into thin pieces.
#Add a generous amount of oil to a large frying pan, more than you think you'd need to avoid sticking.
#Add the rice. Do remember that this dish is fried rice; the other ingredients are to be used in relatively small quantities.
#Add the soy sauce, shredded cabbage, carrots, beans, celery, and eggs. If using pre-scrambled eggs, simply add them. If using raw eggs, clear a spot in the middle of your pan and scramble the eggs there now.
#Add the bean sprouts, being careful not to overcook, and optionally bok choy leaves.

These '''Corn Muffins''' are moist and sweet with a slightly crunchy crust.  This recipe is based on a recipe (quintessential corn muffins) from Rose Levy Berenbaum's [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393057941/?v=glance&amp;n=283155&amp;n=507846&amp;s=books&amp;v=glance Bread Bible], but with yogurt substituted for the sour cream. This is also double her recipe.

==Ingredients==
* 1 cup (128g) [[Cookbook:Cornmeal|cornmeal]]
* 1 cup plus 1 TBSP (150g) bleached all-purpose [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 4 TBSP plus 4 tsp (66g) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 2 tsp [[Cookbook:Baking powder|baking powder]]
* 1/2 tsp [[Cookbook:Baking soda|baking soda]]
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 2 large [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* 1-1/3 cups [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]]
* 4 TBSP [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], melted

please clarify 4/3,is it 3/4 cup of yougart or 1 and 1/3 cup.

==Preparation==
# Melt the butter and allow to cool.  I find it helpful to pour the butter from ramekin to ramekin, which both lubes up the ramekins and cools the butter.
# Mix the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together.  Whisk together the egg and yogurt, and stir them quickly into the dry goods, leaving some lumps.  
# Add the melted butter and fold.
# Pour into ramekins or muffin tins
# Bake 15-18 minutes at 400 degrees Fahrenheit, or until the tops are golden.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* This recipe makes a fine cornmeal, too, if poured into a 6x9 inch pan instead of muffin tins.

This recipe makes a firm and heavy cheesecake, nicely flavored with [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]. It is very important to avoid over-beating the ingredients in order to avoid cracks.

==Ingredients==

For Cake:

*2 ½ [[Cookbook:Pound|pounds]] softened [[Cookbook:Cream Cheese|cream cheese]] 
*1 3/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Corn Starch|corn starch]]
*3 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*[[Cookbook:Zest|zest]] of one [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]] 
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] 
*5 large whole [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
*2 large egg yolks
*¼ cup [[Cookbook:Heavy Cream|heavy cream]]

For Crust:

*5 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounces]] Barnham and Bailey Animal Crackers,or, Sweet Digestive Biscuits,(but no extra sugar with these).
*3 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*4 tablespoons melted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]

==Procedure==
For Crust:

#Butter bottom and sides of [[Cookbook:Inch|10 inch]] [[Cookbook:Springform Pan|springform pan]]. 
#Crush Animal Crackers into a fine powder. Mix with 3 tablespoons of sugar. 
#Add to melted butter and mix with a fork until blended. 
#Press mixture into the bottom and up about one third of the sides of the pan. 
#Refrigerate 1 hour.

For Cake:

#Have all ingredients at room temperature. 
#Preheat oven to [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|475°F]]. 
#Mix sugar, flour and corn starch together. 
#Using a wooden spoon, beat cream cheese with sugar mix, zest and vanilla until it is smooth. Do not overbeat.You could forget the Vanilla &amp; use the juice of the lemon instead.
#Add the whole eggs and egg yolks, one at a time, beating lightly with wooden spoon after each addition. Do not overbeat as this causes the cheesecake to crack. 
#Gently stir in cream. 
#Pour mixture into the pan. Place pan on [[Cookbook:Cookie Sheet|cookie sheet]] to avoid leakage. 
#Bake at 475°F for 15 minutes 
#Lower heat to [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|225°F]] and bake for 1 hour 
#Raise heat to [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|250°F]] and bake for about 15 more minutes 
#Refrigerate immediately for at least one hour, keep covered with a cloth and [[Cookbook:Cookie Sheet|cookie sheet]] (cloth on bottom) until condensation stops forming (if you cover it right away with Saran wrap, condensation will drip onto the cake).

==Ingredients==
* Mashed [[Cookbook:beans|beans]] ([[Cookbook:white beans|white beans]] or [[Cookbook:kidney beans|kidney beans]]) 
* [[Cookbook:Semolina|Semolina]]
* [[Cookbook:Onion|Onions]]
* optional:
** Hacked [[Cookbook:paprika|paprika]]
** [[Cookbook:Maize|Maize]]
** [[Cookbook:Button mushroom|Champignons]]
** [[Cookbook:Soy sauce|Soy sauce]]
** Breading: [[Cookbook:breading|breading mix]], [[Cookbook:salt|salt]], [[Cookbook:pepper|pepper]], optional: [[Cookbook:cumin|cumin]], [[Cookbook:oregano|oregano]], [[Cookbook:Savory|savory]]

==Procedure==
# Mix about the same amount of mashed beans and semolina. 
# Add water and stir until you get a viscous substance. You can add spices to the substance but most spices go into the breading mix, which is where you want them to be.
# Cut onions into pieces and fry them with some oil, add maize and paprika to taste when the onions turn glassy.
# Mix the breading mix with salt, pepper and spices of your choice on a plate. Keep some of the breading mix to sprinkle it on the patties.
# Spread the substance on the breading mix in the form of burger patties.
# Sprinkle the remaining breading mix on the patties.
# Push the patties carefully on a spatula and fry them in a hot, oiled pan. If you use too much oil the patties will be soaked in fat, if you use too little the breading mix will not be fried. It's probably best to add a little bit of oil and then shuffle the patties around in the pan. The patties very quickly become robust enough so you can easily pick them up and turn them with a spatula to see if the other side had enough oil.
# You may want to
#* shake off loose breading mix over the plate, so as not to put loose breading mix into the pan. 
#* topple the patties into the pan.
#* flatten the patties a bit with the spatula, so the breading mix on the underside touches the oiled pan everywhere.

* 1 C coconut (optional)
* 1 C plain flour

This elegant dish of '''Eggs Connaught''' originally published in Volume: five, Pages: 2-3 of Cordon Bleu Cookery Course printed in 1968 is a part-work of Purnell a subsidiary of PBC Publishing Limited.

Legend has it that Eggs Connaught was invented at the Connaught Hotel in Mayfair London is a light and spring like dish perfect for any spring festivities especially Easter where it make a perfect starter for the Easter Sunday Lunch.

== Ingredients ==
*6 [[Cookbook:Hard Boiled Eggs|Hard Boiled Eggs]]
*¼ Pint of [[Cookbook:Milk|Milk]]
*1 Slice of [[Cookbook:Onion|Onion]]
*Blade of [[Cookbook:Mace|Mace]]
*6 [[Cookbook:Pepper|Peppercorns]]
*3½ oz [[Cookbook:Butter|Butter]]
*1 Tablespoon [[Cookbook:Flour|Flour]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|Pepper]]
*1 Packet of Demi-sel [[Cookbook:Cheese|Cheese]]
*1 Teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Paprika|Paprika]]
*4 oz [[Cookbook:Shrimp|Prawns]] (Shelled)
*½ Bunch of [[Cookbook:Watercress|Watercress]] (to Garnish)

== Procedure ==
Scald the milk with onion, mace and peppercorns, tip into a jug, cover and leave to infuse. Rinse the pan with cold water, drop in ½ oz butter, heat gently and blend in the flour. Strain on the milk and add salt. Stir continuously, bring milk to the boil, cook for 1 minute. Turn on to a plate, cover with buttered paper to prevent a skin forming and leave sauce until cold. Cream remaining butter until soft.

Split the hard boiled eggs in two, scoop out the yolks and rub through a wire strainer; keep the whites in a bowl of water as they will soon get hard if exposed to the air. Work the yolks with the butter, cheese, paprika and cold sauce. Chop half the prawns finely, add to the mixture and season to taste. Drain the dry egg whites and have ready a round serving dish or use a cake platter.

Spoon a drop of filling on to the dish to hold each egg white in position, arrange them in a circle and then fill each with the mixture or you can use a piping bag with a ½-inch plain nozzle. Scatter over the remaining prawns (split in half if large) and dust with paprika. Place the watercress in the middle and serve brown bread and butter separately.

For a very special party this recipe can be prepared with smoked salmon in place of prawns. Save a little smoked salmon to cut into fine shreds and scatter over.

'''Salmon Grilled on a Cedar Plank''' is a common method for preparing salmon, traditional to the Native Americans of the Pacific Northwest of the United States and British Columbia in Canada.

The cedar planks should be free of any chemical treatments or coatings. The planks are soaked in water for several hours prior to grilling, to prevent burning. A baking pan of water with the planks weighted down to submerge them works well.

The salmon should be prepared to fit on the planks of cedar.  Whole fillets can be placed on longer planks, while shorter ones can be used for salmon steaks.  Salmon should be as fresh as possible.  Wild salmon has the most flavor, but farm raised salmon is also acceptable, and less expensive.

==Ingredients==
*[[Cookbook:Salmon|Salmon]]  1/3 to 1/2 lb (150-225g) per person  (I like left overs)
*Marinade
**[[Cookbook:Worcester sauce|Worcester sauce]] - a half cup
**A little [[Cookbook:Garlic powder|garlic powder]] 
**[[Cookbook:Lemon pepper|Lemon pepper]]
**A [[Cookbook:Beer|beer]]

==Equipment==
*Cedar planks
*A BBQ pit.  Charcoal should be spread somewhat to the back so the fish can be moved for more or less fire.

==Procedure==
#Preheat the grill
#Briefly place the salmon in the marinade
#Place the salmon on the plank skin side down. It should not hang over. 
#Grill watching carefully. A glass of water or the left over marinade by the grill can be used to partially douse the fire when it gets too hot. As an alternative, a squirt-bottle or mister filled with water can douse any fire that commences on the plank.  Individual planks give flexibility in moving to get all done evenly. Don't turn the fish on the plank, just move the plank(s) around, rotate, etc. 
#Remove the plank to onto a baking pan when the fish is cooked to the desired doneness and transfer to plates or a serving platter.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*A [[Cookbook:Microwave oven|microwave oven]] can be used to cook the salmon to greater degrees of doneness.

== Ingredients ==
* 8 oz. farmer's cheese (a soft, NOT a hard cheese) (if unsalted add 1 tsp. salt)
* 4 oz. [[Cookbook:cream cheese|cream cheese]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:egg|egg]]
* 2 tbs. flour

== Preparation ==
Mash together all of the ingredients until well mixed.

== Notes ==

Farmer's cheese is similar to a dry-curd [[Cookbook:cottage cheese|cottage cheese]] and is unavailable outside predominately Eastern European and Jewish areas. Dry-curd cottage cheese is a sub-par substitution, and must be drained of all excess liquid if it is to be used.

'''Lapis Legit''' (Dutch: ''spekkoek'') is spice-flavored multilayered cake. A legacy of Dutch occupation in Indonesia, the cake is enjoyed during Eid ul-Fitr and Christmas celebrations. In the Netherlands, the sliced cake is served as dessert in ''Rijstafel'' (Indonesian rice table).

The cake has firm texture, similar to Baumkuchen in a baking plate but without chocolate or sugar shell. The cake requires lots of patience to bake. Each thin layer is made by pouring a small amount of the batter from a small cup, baked one layer after another in the oven until golden with heat from the top. Cake baked in gas oven has better aroma compared to cake baked in electric oven, but a Dutch oven with charcoal fire on top of the lid produces the best result. 

In case clove buds or cardamon seeds are difficult to find, use spekkoek powder as a replacement. Milling and mixing the spice before baking produces a cake with an excellent aroma. 

==Ingredients==
* 10 large yolks
* 4 eggs whites
* 125 gr [[Cookbook:Castor sugar|castor sugar]]
* 195 gr sweetened [[Cookbook:Condensed milk|condensed milk]]
* 500 gr [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* 125 gr cake [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 10 [[Cookbook:Clove|clove]] buds, milled
* 10 [[Cookbook:Cardamom|cardamom]] seeds, milled
* 2 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]] mace powder
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]] powder
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] powder

==Directions==
# Mix and sift spice ingredients.
# Beat butter until smooth and creamy.
# Beat egg yolks with castor sugar until fluffy.
# Beat egg whites in seperate mixing bowl until fluffy, then mix with egg yolks.
# Mix the spices, condensed milk, flour, and butter.
# Grease a baking pan.
# Using a small cup, pour 30-35 cc batter into baking pan to make a layer.
# Bake in preheated 350°F oven, heat from top, until golden (4-5 minutes).
# Remove from oven, paint butter for flavoring, and pour 30-35 cc batter to make another layer.
# Repeat to make around 30-40 layers.

== Notes, tips, and variations ==
* Adding to the complexity of the baking process, some cake shops add dried [[Cookbook:Plum|plums]] (prunes) inside and on top of the cake.

[[Image:English Breakfast nic.jpg|right|thumb|300px|English Breakfast]]

== Origins of the English Breakfast ==

The traditional English [[Cookbook:breakfast|breakfast]] of eggs, [[Cookbook:bacon|bacon]], [[Cookbook:sausage|sausage]] and other ingredients is ubiquitous the world over. Cafés and hotels all around the world offer a version of &quot;English breakfast&quot;, often far removed from what might be considered conventional!

The English breakfast as it is known today is based, like so many British traditions, on what became popular in the Victorian era. Victorian home economist Isabella Beeton gives the following advice in ''The Book of Household Management'' (1861) about breakfast:

{{Cquote|The following list of hot dishes may perhaps assist our readers in knowing what to provide for the comfortable meal called breakfast. Broiled fish, such as mackerel, whiting, herrings, dried haddocks, &amp;c.; mutton chops and rump-steaks, broiled sheep’s kidneys, kidneys à la maître d’hôtel, sausages, plain rashers of bacon, bacon and poached eggs, ham and poached eggs, omelets, plain boiled eggs, oeufs-au-plat, poached eggs on toast, muffins, toast, marmalade, butter, &amp;c. &amp;c.}}

Nowadays rather few Englishmen start their day with such a large meal. Surveys cited in ''The Magpie history of food'' (Audrey Ellis, 1977) indicate that in 1958 50% of British families still started their day with a cooked breakfast, but by 1976 it had fallen to 18%. More recent surveys (within the last 2-3 years) put the figure today at less than 1%.

The English breakfast is still a mainstay of boarding houses, hotels and cafés in Britain, however, and will be found on the menu of most such establishments.

== What is in an English breakfast? ==
The key components of an English breakfast include:
* bacon
* sausages
* black pudding
* eggs
* tomatoes
* baked beans
* mushrooms
* potatoes
* fried bread

An English breakfast may also include:
* cereal
* toast
* tea
* orange juice

Usually the eggs are fried, but for a lighter, more healthy option they can be poached. The bacon can also be fried, but traditionally it is more often [[Cookbook:Grilling|grilled]] until slightly crispy. A fresh tomato, halved and then grilled until browned, is much nicer than the tinned tomatoes or tinned baked beans so often substituted, and hot toast completes the meal. Traditionally it is served with tea (with milk), although coffee and orange juice are usually also offered.

[[Image:Full English Breakfast.JPG|right|thumb|Full English Breakfast]]
A variant on the above, called the &quot;Full English Breakfast&quot;, is a more substantial version which additionally contains a selection of the following:
* one fried egg
* one English-style sausage
* two rashers of crispy fried bacon
* a portion of fried mushrooms (browned)
* two slices of fried [[Cookbook:black pudding|black pudding]] (a type of sausage made with pig's blood)
* half a tomato, fried until brown
* one slice of fried bread (a slice of white bread fried in oil, preferably the oil used to cook the bacon)

By the time you have added in all these (and other fried items such as hash browns, [[Cookbook:Bubble and squeak|bubble and squeak]] or beans), it can become quite a plateful. Really large full English breakfasts (often colloquially known as &quot;fry-ups&quot;) are a staple of cheap cafés, themselves known as &quot;greasy spoons&quot; - a reference to the lack of quality and low standards of cleanliness of the establishment.  True aficionados, however, often maintain that the best examples of a fry-up can only be found from such establishments, and many believe this is a result of the frying fat being reused and thus infused with the flavours of the dish.

== Making an English breakfast ==
Like so many famous dishes, the English breakfast frequently suffers from being prepared badly and with poor quality ingredients. Often this means everything is fried in copious quantities of fat, making for a heavy and unpleasant meal. Cooked well, with high quality ingredients, it can be a delicious start to the day - although something to have more as an occasional treat, perhaps, than every day!

Preparing an English breakfast is quite easy; it is basically a matter of starting off cooking the items that take the longest to cook, and moving through to the things that take the least time so that it is all ready at the same time. It is made even easier by the fact that most of the ingredients can be kept warm for a while once cooked without spoiling; this fact allows for the common way of serving English breakfasts as a kind of buffet where diners can help themselves from warm serving plates.

==Ingredients==

To make an English breakfast for 4 people, you will need:
* 4 rashers of [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]] (smoked bacon without too much fat is best, e.g. smoked back bacon)
* 4 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]] (although you could cook 2 eggs per person if your guests are hungry!)
* 4 English-style [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausages]]
* 4 medium sized [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], halved across-ways
* 400g [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]], sliced
* 4-8 slices of [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] (traditionally white)
* tin [[Cookbook:Baked Beans|baked beans]] (optional)

==Procedure==

===&quot;Healthy&quot; Version===

The following instructions are for making a slightly healthier version of an English breakfast, with the emphasis on grilling and poaching rather than frying.

# Heat the grill to a medium heat, and cook the sausages under it, turning frequently.
# Cover the base of a frying pan with about 1cm of water, and heat on a high heat until boiling. When it is boiling, carefully break the eggs into it. If you have cooking rings, you can put these into the water first and then break the eggs into the rings, to prevent the eggs from spreading too much - although really fresh eggs should stay together anyway. Once the eggs are in the pan, wait a few moments for the water to heat up again, then turn the heat down to a very very gently simmer. To ensure the tops of the eggs are cooked, spoon water from around the edge of the pan over the top of the eggs a few times during cooking. When cooked, the egg white should be soft but cooked through and the yolk still runny.
# Put the halved tomatoes under the grill with the sausages.
# If using, put the baked beans into a pan and heat through over a medium heat.
# Heat up a very small amount of oil in another pan, and fry the mushrooms until they are soft.
# Put the bacon under the grill along with the sausages and tomatoes. Cook on one side for about 2 minutes, then turn once and repeat. Cook longer if crispier bacon is preferred.
# Whilst cooking the bacon, use a toaster or grill to toast the bread until golden.
# Serve the eggs, bacon, mushrooms, sausage, tomato and beans onto piping hot plates, with the toast on a separate plate or toast rack. Serve with butter and jam for the toast, and hot tea with milk.

As a timing guide, here is how long (approximately) each item takes to cook:
* sausages - 10-15 mins
* eggs - 8-10 mins
* tomatoes - 6 mins
* beans - 5 mins
* mushrooms - 4 mins
* bacon - 4 mins
* toast - 3 mins

However, if you can't cope with doing it all at once (or don't have enough pans / rings), it is possible to keep all of the items warm in a preheated oven, so you can just cook each item in turn and keep it warm until needed. Try not to keep the eggs warm for too long before serving though, as the yolks may harden.

===&quot;Unhealthy&quot; Version===

They use the same ingredients as above and are more in keeping with the spirit of the dish.

# While frying the other ingredients, toast the bread in a grill or toaster.  Assuming 2 slices per person, you should have enough by the time you finish the fried food.  Be sure to butter them heavily with real butter rather than low-fat spread.  Place 4 plates on the bottom shelf of an oven, and one on the top.  Set the oven to its lowest heat.
# Melt some [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]] in a large frying pan (enough to make a layer of fat around 1cm deep) and brown the sausage in it over a high heat.  Lower heat and cook the sausage for around 4 minutes, leave it in the pan.  A lot of fat will leak from the sausages.  Add the bacon (2 strips per person rather than 1) and cook to taste, flipping regularly (2-3 minutes for pink, 4-6 for a darker red bacon with crispy fat).  The bacon will also release a lot of fat.  Transfer the bacon to the warmed dish in the top of the oven.  Leave the sausage in the pan.
# Add the mushrooms and tomatoes to the pan. Add the tin of baked beans to a small pot and heat on a separate ring.  After 2-4 minutes, transfer the mushrooms to the oven with the bacon. Transfer the tomato then too, or leave it a little longer depending on taste.
# The sausages should now be dark brown, push them to the side of the pan and break an egg into the fat.  Using a spatula, push hot fat over the yolk until it begins to bubble but is still liquid.  This should take about 1 minute or so in a hot pan.  Set out the 4 warmed plates beforehand and add an egg to each.  When done, add the sausage, bacon, and mushrooms.  Add the beans last.  Serve with the buttered toast on a separate plate.
# If you are using black pudding, add it to the fat with the bacon and remove it before the eggs.

This is a simple [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]] [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce]] that works well for everyday meals, even with picky eaters. It is best served hot at the table, to be poured over lightly cooked pasta. Shredded [[Cookbook:Mozzarella Cheese|mozzarella cheese]] may be added on top.

==Ingredients==

* 29 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounce]] (922 [[Cookbook:g|g]]) can of plain [[Cookbook:Tomato Puree|tomato puree]] or ground [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] dried [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]]
* 2 teaspoons dried [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]] (Albahaca)
* 1/2 teaspoon granulated [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

Optionally, add:

* canned sliced [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]] (ones sold in see-through jars are generally better quality)
* cooked ground [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] or bits of steak (may be added at the table)

==Procedure==

#For more efficient use of the spices, you should grind them well with the salt. The salt helps to grind the spices. If you skip this step, increase the amount of spices. Also double the spices if you prefer a spicy sauce.
#Mix everything in a pot.
#Bring to a boil while stirring to prevent the sauce from burning to the bottom of the pan.
#Immediately remove from the heat and serve. Hot tomato products lose tomato flavor, so don't delay.

The word '''teriyaki'' is a combination of two Japanese words, ''teri'', &quot;luster&quot;, and ''yaki'', &quot;to grill or broil&quot;. The [[Cookbook:Mirin|mirin]] in the sauce gives a good lustre to meat as it is cooked. Traditionally it was used with fish. It can also be used as a [[Cookbook:Marinating|marinade]] for pre-cooked meat and poultry, as well as a delicious [[Cookbook:Basting|baste]] for items on the grill or rotisserie. Teriyaki sauce is a complement to virtually any type of meat (as long as you adjust the flavors accordingly), especially steak, chicken, fish and pork.

==Ingredients of teriyaki==

* 1/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (2 parts) [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]
* 1/4 cup (2 parts) [[Cookbook:Mirin|mirin]] (sweetened rice wine for cooking)
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] (1 part) brown [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1 tsp of fresh, peeled, finely chopped ginger
A litte bit of sake may also be added.

==Procedure==

#Mix everything in a 1-[[Cookbook:Quart|quart]] pot over low heat until the sugar dissolves.

That's it. You'll want to heat the [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce]] with some pre-cooked [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]] in it of course, or use it to [[Cookbook:Marinating|marinate]] some raw meat overnight in the refrigerator.

==Variation==

*As given, this sauce is thin. Boil some [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]] or [[Cookbook:Potato starch|potato starch]] into it if you wish to thicken it.
*[[Cookbook:Pineapple|Pineapple]] juice might be a reasonable [[Cookbook:Mirin|mirin]] substitute.
*Lime juice may also be added for a tart flavor.

      <comment>/* If you have raw turkey */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Meat Recipes|Meat Recipes]]

'''Turkey Soup''' works well as an everyday meal. Chicken may be used in place of turkey, but is not as nice and often costs more per pound.

==Ingredients==

* raw [[Cookbook:Turkey|turkey]], or cooked turkey and canned [[Cookbook:Broth|broth]]
* [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]]
* [[Cookbook:Broccoli|broccoli]]
* wide [[Cookbook:Egg noodles|egg noodles]]
* [[Cookbook:Sage|sage]]
* [[Cookbook:Rosemary|rosemary]]
* [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]]

Optionally, add:

* [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] or egg white
* [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Asparagus|asparagus]]
* frozen [[Cookbook:Corn|corn]]
* [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaf]]

==Procedure==
===If you have raw turkey===
#Thaw the turkey in the refrigerator. This may take a few days.
#Wash the turkey, including the inside. There may be a bag of organ meat inside the turkey; some of this will be needed.
#Discard the liver, often found in the organ bag.
#Discard the kidneys if you can find them. They are usually still attached to the inside of the turkey. Your broth will taste better if you can get rid of the kidneys and the liver.
#Place the turkey in a pan, preferably on a wire rack to keep the turkey out of the broth.
#Poke holes in the turkey to let the broth drain. Do this also to the neck.
#Place the neck, heart, and gizzards in the pan. To protect them from the heat, shove them under the edge of the turkey a bit.
#Cook the turkey, following directions for temperature. Increased time will get you more broth and make the meat nearest to the skin be as if it were fried. At regular intervals, collect broth from the pan and replace it with a small amount of water to prevent burning. (the broth in the pan will burn if it is allowed to go completely dry) You may wish to eat the heart part-way through the cooking time.
#Eat the turkey meal, saving the sliceable parts for sandwiches and the softer parts for soup. Save the skin and bones.
#Place the skin, bones, wing tips, neck, gizzards, and so on into a large pot. Leave out any severely burned parts. Crush the bones down a bit, and cover with water, and add a lid.
#Bring to a boil reduce heat to a simmer. Simmer the longer the better; 30 minutes will do but an hour or two would be better. You may need to add water from time to time to replace any lost water. Do not allow the water to fully boil away. This is critical; it is very easy to ruin this by boiling away the water.
#Strain the liquid from this pot into another container.
#Mix some of the liquid from the boiling of the bones into the broth you collected while cooking. You'll have to go by taste and experiance. If you use too many bones in the broth, the result will have an overly strong flavor you may add water to taste. Note that a proper broth solidifies like gelatin when it is refrigerated.
#If you have a great deal of fat, you may wish to scrape some off after it solidifies. Do not remove all of the fat, you will lose a lot of the flavor.

===Once you have the broth and cooked turkey===
#Cut the turkey into chunks similar in size to your egg noodles. Most ingredients should be cut to this size.
#Place the broth, spices, and celery into a large pot.
#Bring the pot to a simmer.
#If using an egg, this is the time to add it. Mix the egg in a bowl, or just use the white. From just above the surface of the liquid in your pot, dribble the egg into the pot while moving across the pot. Do not stir until the egg has set. This should produce egg filaments.
#Add the noodles, turkey and, optionally, the frozen corn.
#If your broth did not have much fat, add some oil.
#If the noodles are not soft yet, wait until they are soft.
#Add the broccoli and, optionally, the asparagus. When the broccoli loses the bluish cast and becomes bright green, serve the soup. Do not allow the broccoli to cook any more, especially not to the point where it begins to get a yellow-brown cast. You may use ice to stop the cooking and more quickly bring the soup to an eatable temperature.

==Procedure==
Omelettes take little time to complete. Always ensure your fillings are either pre-cooked, able to be finished in the time available, or edible when raw but warmed.

An omelette can be served folded in half or thirds.

'''Note:''' Before non-stick coating became common, many cooks would keep a special omelette pan which would not be used for any other purpose. '''It is important to use a very clean pan, especially if it is not a &quot;non-stick&quot; pan'''. If keeping a pan solely for omelettes, after cooking, wipe well with a clean cloth or paper-towel and then apply a thin coating of clean vegetable oil.

===If you only have a normal frying pan===
#Chop up the filling.
#Mix the eggs well. You may add [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] to thin them (up to 1 Tbsp for each egg).
#Pour the eggs into a cool frying pan.
#Heat the pan, stirring constantly.
#Stop stirring as soon as solid egg begins to form.
#As the egg solidifies, pry it loose around the edges.
#If you didn't stir enough earlier, you may have difficulty solidifying the egg on top. In this case, you may pry up an edge while tilting the pan to let liquid egg flow under the solid egg. It is best to avoid this problem though.
#Keep loosening the egg from the edges until you can slide it around.
#Now you need to flip the egg without ripping it. If you have a very wide turner (or two smaller ones), you can use that. Otherwise, you'll have to flip the egg in the air. To do so, rapidly move the pan away from you then up, back toward you a bit, and then very rapidly downward. Catch the egg in the pan.
#Place filling on the egg.
#When the egg is done, wrap it around the filling. Serve.

===If you have a large flat professional-style cooktop===
#Chop up the filling.
#Mix the eggs well. You may add milk or cream to thin them.
#Heat your cooktop. (you're doing this without a pan, on the cooktop)
#Pour the eggs, using a spiral motion to spread them wide and thin.
#When the egg has set, gently add fillings on top.
#Using a large (3-inch by 12-inch, or 75 x 300mm) turner, fold the egg over the filling.
#When you think the bottom has cooked, flip the omelette over to cook the other side.

==Variations==
*Use 3 eggs and a dash of [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] or [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]] instead of the 2 eggs and 2 egg whites.
*Use eggs and hot water instead of milk or cream '''(do not use boiling water; that will cook the eggs)
*Fry the omelette in [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]].
*After folding the omelette, top with grated [[Cookbook:Cheddar Cheese|cheddar]] and place frying pan under a grill until the cheese begins to brown.
*Garnish with [[Cookbook:Cream Cheese|cream cheese]], [[Cookbook:Sour Cream|sour cream]] or other thickened dairy product with a fragrant sprig of a fresh herb or edible flower.

[[Image:CookbookWontonSoup.jpg|thumb|256px|wonton soup]]
Wonton filling is essentially [[Cookbook:Stir-fry|stir-fry]], but with smaller particles and less cooking. It goes hot into a [[Cookbook:Wonton Wrapper|wonton wrapper]] (equal to 1/4 of an [[Cookbook:Egg Roll|egg roll]] wrapper), which is then cooked in a hot [[Cookbook:Broth|broth]].

Note that these wontons do not contain [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]] and [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]], which are used by commercial wonton producers to cheapen the filling. The filling in these wontons is superior.

==Ingredients==

* wonton wrappers, or egg roll wrappers cut into quarters
* [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] [[Cookbook:Broth|broth]], [[Cookbook:Dashi|dashi]], or plain [[Cookbook:Miso Soup|miso soup broth]]
* [[Cookbook:Meat and poultry|meat or poultry]] (suggested: [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] or [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]])
* [[Cookbook:Bok Choy|bok choy]], or [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]] and perhaps [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]]
* [[Cookbook:Broccoli|broccoli]]
* [[Cookbook:Bean sprouts|bean sprouts]]
* powdered [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
* [[Cookbook:Soy sauce|soy sauce]]
* [[Cookbook:Bamboo Shoot|bamboo shoots]]
* [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] to [[Cookbook:Frying|fry]] the filling, possibly including [[Cookbook:Sesame Oil|sesame oil]]

==Procedure==

===Filling===
#Cut the meat into tiny pieces. This is much easier to do if the meat is cooked, but the result will be better if you cut the meat raw, then cook it.
#Cut the bamboo shoots into matchsticks.
#Chop the broccoli head into little pieces, perhaps 3/8-inch diameter. Cut the stalk into matchsticks.
#If using celery, cut the stalks lengthwise into 3/4-inch wide pieces and then crosswise into 1/8-inch slices.
#If using bok choy, cut the leaves away from the stalk. Treat the stalks as celery. Cut the leaves crosswise in 1/2-inch strips, then break the strips into 1.5-inch pieces.
#If using spinach, treat it much like the bok choy leaves.
#Wash the bean sprouts, discarding any that are not white and crisp.
#Place oil in a [[Cookbook:Wok|wok]] and turn on the heat. High temperatures can produce a better result, but require rapid stirring to prevent burning. Beginners should use lower temperatures. Split the cooking into batches as needed to ensure that your wok is not too full; there should be plenty of room to stir and toss the food. You may prefer to cook each ingredient separately, then mix them at the end.
#Add the meat. If it is uncooked, lightly [[Cookbook:Stir-frying|stir-fry]] it now. Drain juices and add more oil as needed.
#You may add a small amount of sesame seed oil and/or [[Cookbook:Sesame Seed|sesame seeds]] for flavor.
#Add soy sauce. For a typical wok full of food, add a [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]].
#Add ginger. About 1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] of ginger should be right, depending on taste. Ginger is somewhat hot.
#Add the broccoli, and the celery and/or bok choy stalks. When done, they should be just slightly softened. Broccoli should end up being very bright green, losing its bluish cast but not gaining any hint of a yellow-brown cast.
#Add bok choy leaves and/or spinach. When done, they should be just barely wilted.
#Add the bamboo shoots and bean sprouts, and turn off the heat. Do not overcook the bean sprouts.

===Construction and boiling===
#Begin heating water or chicken broth to cook the wontons. You will need this pot to be at a high [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]] or low [[Cookbook:Boiling|boil]] to cook the wontons, though such temperatures can damage the taste of dashi and miso soup. Thus, if using dashi or miso soup, you must do the initial cooking in water.
#Place a small amount of filling onto a wonton wrapper. Pull the corners of the wrapper up, so that all four corners touch each other. Pinch and/or fold the edges to seal the wonton. Repeat as needed.
#Gently lower some wontons into the pot. Do not overfill the pot. Initially, wontons are easy to unseal by accident. While these cook, you can make more wontons.
#Cook the wontons for 3 minutes. Remove them with a [[Cookbook:Slotted Spoon|slotted spoon]] and place them aside. Keep adding and removing wontons until all are cooked.
#To serve, place some wontons in a bowl and pour your choice of liquid over them.

==Variation==
You can use [[Cookbook:Tamales|tamale]] filling.

This is a good (red, of course) clam chowder suitable for everyday use, even with picky eaters.

==Ingredients==
* 15 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounce]] (425 [[Cookbook:gram|g]]) canned [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], or 2 small boiled potatoes
* 28 ounce (794 g) canned [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]] in juice, or 2 large tomatoes and tomato juice
* 6.5 ounce (184 g) canned chopped [[Cookbook:Clam|clams]], minimum
* 2 stalks of [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]]

==Procedure==
#Core the tomatoes. Remove the pale parts and the seeds. For canned tomatoes, a strainer will be helpful.
#Chop all non-clam ingredients to match the clams in size.
#Optionally add spices. Suggestions: [[Cookbook:Dill|dill seed]], [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]], [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]], [[Cookbook:Celery|celery seed]], [[Cookbook:Tarragon|tarragon]], [[Cookbook:Marjoram|marjoram]], fresh [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]]
#Cook the chowder without boiling until the celery begins to get soft.

==Variation==
You can use a sturdy type of [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]] in place of the clams. Good choices are [[Cookbook:catfish|catfish]], tilapia, and pollock. You can use cooked [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] in place of the potatoes. You can add [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]] or [[Cookbook:Seaweed|seaweed]], perhaps in place of the celery. You can add [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]].

Sprouts make for an excellent salad, both tastier and more nutritious than a lettuce-based salad.
Placement as directed ensures that the salad is easily forkable (the fork loosely passes through the top layers to embed in the lowest layer) and ensures that the oil will not
all puddle at the bottom. This salad serves two adults, assumed to be eating from the same dish.

==Ingredients==

* 1 package (4&quot; by 4&quot;, sprout height) of plain [[Cookbook:Alfalfa|alfalfa sprouts]]
* 1/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] of real [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]] bits
* 2 to 4 very ripe medium-sized [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
* 3 stalks of [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]]
* 1/3 cup of [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]
* 1/3 cup of red wine [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]

==Procedure==

#Cut the tomatoes into chunks, about 1.2 inches in diameter. If using tomatoes that are small, cut each one at least once. Remove the core and, optionally, the gooey parts.
#Cut the celery crosswise, with 1-inch spacing near the thick base and 2-inch spacing near the narrow top.
#Distribute the celery and tomato pieces evenly in the bottom of a wide bowl. (the salad bowl)
#Holding the sprouts so that they do not separate and entangle themselves, wash them under running water.
#Place the sprouts into a bowl full of water. Gently dunk them and change the water a few times, removing the seed casings without getting the sprouts all tangled up.
#Drain the sprouts well. You may need to shake them a bit.
#Spread the sprouts over the tomatoes and celery, still being careful not to make a tangled mess.
#Sprinkle the bacon bits over top of the sprouts. The sprouts should be well-covered; use more bacon if needed.
#Drizzle oil over the bacon. The oil will adhere to the bacon better than it does to the sprouts.
#Sprinkle vinegar over everything.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* Garnish it with raisins and crunchy dry roasted peanuts.

'''Cashew Chicken''' is similar to a [[Cookbook:Broccoli Stir Fry|stir-fry]], but with a somewhat thick sauce. In this dish, the cashews become soft (but see '''Variations''' below). This dish goes well served over rice.

==Ingredients==

* [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]]
* powdered [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
* vegetables
* [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]
* [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] to [[Cookbook:Frying|fry]] with
* whole roasted [[Cookbook:Cashew|cashews]], salted or not
* [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] [[Cookbook:Broth|broth]]
* [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]]
* vegetables

==Procedure==
#Begin boiling the cashews in a covered pot. Be sure to add water from time to time so that the cashews are kept wet.
#Prepare the chicken and vegetables as you would for [[Cookbook:Broccoli Stir Fry|Broccoli Stir Fry]] or [[Cookbook:Egg Roll|Egg Roll]] filling, with particle sizes around 1-inch diameter.
#For the sauce, start with 1 cup of chicken broth and 1 tablespoon of corn starch. Bring this to a boil while stirring. Add additional corn starch or chicken broth as needed to control the thickness. You may also wish to add some sugar, orange juice, and additional soy sauce.
#Add the sauce and cashews to the rest of the dish.
#Serve with rice.

==Variation==
Instead of stir-frying the chicken and boiling the cashews, you can add unboiled cashew and batter-fried chicken on top of the dish as you serve it. In this case, you may wish to pour the sauce over the top. Such a dish would need to be served quickly, before the breading gets soggy. For details, see the [[Cookbook:Leong's Cashew Chicken|Leong's Cashew Chicken]] recipe.

The cashews may also be stir-fried alone, with or without boiling.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Peru|Cuisine of Peru]]

'''Lomo Saltado''' is a dish of marinated steak, vegetables and fried potatoes, usually served over white [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]]. It is one of the most popular recipes in Peru and is often found on the menu at many smaller restaurants at a very reasonable price.

==Ingredients==

* 2 [[Cookbook:Pound|pounds]] (500[[Cookbook:Gram|g]]) of [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] tenderloin or other tender steak
* ¼ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] red [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]], e.g. Burgundy
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] of crushed [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* 2 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]] cut in strips
* 4 [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], seeds removed, [[Cookbook:Purée|puréed]] in a [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]]
* 5 [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] peeled and cut into strips for [[Cookbook:Frying|frying]]
* 1 yellow Peruvian [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|pepper]] (aji) cut into thin strips * 
1 tablespoon of [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
* 2 tablespoons of [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]
* [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]] for frying
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* [[Cookbook:Cilantro|culantro]]

==Procedure==

# Cut the meat into thin strips and [[Cookbook:Marinating|marinate]] them in the wine for 1 hour.
# Use a [[Cookbook:Wok|wok]] to cook garlic in oil over medium heat and add the meat. Reserve the juice.
# Add the tomato purée, salt and pepper. Cook a few minutes.
# Add the soy sauce while stirring the meat in the wok.
# Add the onions, aji strip, cilantro and vinegar. Combine the juice from the meat.
# Fry the potatoes in a separate pan and add to the other ingredients.
# Serve the dish with white rice.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* Variations to the recipe might use the tomatoes cut in slices instead of as a purée or not using the wine but a greater quantity of vinegar. 
* Using a different kind of hot pepper changes the flavor of this dish completely.

{{recipesummary|Appetizer recipes|6-8|3 hours|2|Image=[[Image:Ceviche.png|300px]]}}

==Ingredients==
* 2 pounds of [[Cookbook:white fish|white fish]] ([[Cookbook:mahi mahi|mahi mahi]] is an excellent choice)
* juice from about 6 large [[Cookbook:Lime|limes]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|red peppers]], diced
* 2 finely diced [[Cookbook:Jalapeño|jalapeño pepper]]s (to your preference)
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:pepper|pepper]] to taste
* 1 large [[Cookbook:onion|onion]], sliced into half-rings
* bunch of finely chopped [[Cookbook:cilantro|cilantro]]

;Sides:
* 2 [[Cookbook:lettuce|lettuce]] leaves per plate
* 12 to 16 [[Cookbook:Corn|corn]] cobs cut into 2 inch pieces, cooked as usual
* 3 or 4 [[Cookbook:Sweet Potato|sweet potato]]es, boiled and peeled

==Procedure==
# Wash and de-bone the fish and cut them into ½ inch x ½ inch chunks.
# Season the fish with salt, pepper, red pepper and jalapeño. [[Cookbook:Marinating|Marinate]] the fish for 1 hour to ”cold cook”. You should have enough lime juice to completely cover the fish.
# Add onion. Mix gently. Marinate for 1 more hour.
# Serve on a bed of lettuce and add two pieces of corn on the cob and a portion of the sweet potato.

==Notes==
* Ceviche (an alternate spelling) can be eaten as an entrée as well. In this case, this will be enough for about two people.
* More traditional recipes call for much less marinating. In fact, some will marinate it for as little as 10 minutes total (basically just the time it takes to get the sides ready). If marinating for a small amount of time be aware that the acidity of the lime is the only thing that &quot;cooks&quot; the fish.

==Ingredients==
* 10 medium [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] (new or red a good choice)
* 1 pound of [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]] (Romano, Mexican or feta work well) 
* 2 small [[Cookbook:Jalapeño|jalapeño peppers]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Evaporated milk|evaporated milk]]

* [[Cookbook:Lettuce|lettuce]]
* 3 [[Cookbook:Hard Boiled Eggs|hard boiled eggs]]
* [[Cookbook:Olive|black olives]]

==Preparation==
# Peel and boil potatoes as you normally would. Drain water, and allow them to cool.
# In a blender, mix the cheese, peppers, milk, oil, garlic, crackers, mustard, salt and pepper. The sauce should be fairly thick; add more crackers if not, or add milk if too thick
# Lay a bed of lettuce in a serving dish and place the potatoes on top. Cover with the sauce. Cut the hard boiled eggs in half and place on top of the potatoes. Add black olives if desired
# This dish can be served slightly cold
# Some recipes suggest the use of Huacatay, but this is a confusion. Huacatay is a key ingredient of Ocopa, another peruvian sauce

These '''Fried Fish''' are battered and [[Cookbook:Deep frying|deep-fat fried]]. You'll need thin fish filets that don't fall apart when cooked. Fried fish go well with soda (pop). They can be served with [[Cookbook:Ketchup|ketchup]] (catsup), [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]], or a mixture of the two. They could also be served with [[Cookbook:Sweet and Sour|sweet-and-sour]] sauce or [[Cookbook:Teriyaki Sauce|teriaki]] sauce. Fried fish are a part of [[Cookbook:Fish and Chips|fish and chips]].

==Ingredients==

* ''thin'' [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]] filets (suggested: catfish, tilapia, or the less-durable flounder)
* [[Cookbook:Oil|Oil]] with a high [[Smoke point|smoke point]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Egg|Egg]] white
* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Beer|beer]], or 1 cup cold water and 1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* extra flour to dust the fish

==Procedure==
#Start heating the oil. This recipe is intended for fast cooking in very hot oil.
#Get the batter ingredients ready to mix.
#Microwave the fish, to ensure that the inside is hot. Flip the fish as you microwave it. When done, the fish should be hot and should look half-cooked.
#Mix the flour, egg white, and beer.
#Pat a fish dry with a paper towel, then lightly dust it with flour to ensure that it is really dry.
#Dip the fish, and your hand, into the batter. Coat them well. The batter will help protect your hand from splatter.
#Hold the fish right above the oil, then gently slide the fish into the oil.
#With tongs, nudge the fish as needed to keep it from sticking to the bottom. Turn the fish over as it cooks.
#Remove the fish when it looks good, then serve it immediately.

==Warning==
When a pot of hot oil catches fire, the flames will reach up for 2 or 3 feet. If you must work under flammable cabinets or shelves, be sure to have a fire extinguisher handy. [[Cookbook:Soybean Oil|Soybean oil]], [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]], and [[Cookbook:Peanut Oil|peanut oil]] withstand heat better than most cooking oils.

==Variation==
Whip the egg white, or leave it out entirely. Add [[Cookbook:Cornmeal|cornmeal]] to the batter.

The '''Turkey Wrap''' works well as an everyday meal. Chicken may be used in place of turkey, but is not as nice and often costs more per pound.

==Ingredients==

* 8 large ([[Cookbook:Burrito|burrito]]-size, about 12-inch) [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] [[Cookbook:Tortilla|tortillas]].
* 6 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounce]] can of [[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomato paste]]
* 6 ounce (net drained weight) [[Cookbook:Black Olive|black olives]]
* several [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] of cooked [[Cookbook:Turkey|turkey]]

==Procedure==
#Cut the olives in half.
#Cut the turkey into 3/4-inch chunks.
#Mix the olives and tomato paste.
#Mix in turkey, adding as much as will be covered by the paste.
#Optionally, warm the mixture.
#Place some of the mixture on a tortilla.
#Wrap the tortilla around the mixture.
#Place the finished wrap on an ungreased cookie sheet, with the exposed edge (flap) downward to prevent the wrap from coming undone before it is cooked.
#Keep making wraps as needed.
#Place the cookie sheet in an oven set to [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|350°F]].
#Remove the wraps when they start to brown, which should be about 15 minutes.
#Let the wraps cool a bit on the outside while heat sinks into the inside.

'''Ume juice''' is extracted by preserving the fruits in sugar.  It tastes sweet and acidic, and is a refreshing drink, often enjoyed in the summer.  '''Ume-shu''' is sweet and smooth.  The taste and aroma of ume-shu can appeal to even those people who normally dislike the taste of [[Cookbook:Alcohol|alcohol]]. 
==Ingredients==
*Raw ume: 1kg
*Hard rock sugar: 1kg
*[[Cookbook:Honey|Honey]]: to taste
*(White liquor: a bit to taste)
*A container: preferably a sealable glassware container.

==Procedure==
#Wash raw ume and wipe clean of moisture.
#Cram tightly into container with rock sugar. White liquor can be poured in at this time.
#Pour honey into container on top of ume.
#Leave in a cool, dark place until fruit are shriveled and leathery.
#Remove fruit from container.

Dilute this liquid with two times as much water to drink.
Should be kept in a cool place during summer.

'''Umeboshi''' (&amp;#26757;&amp;#24178;, pickled [[Ume|Japanese plum]]) is a kind of [[Cookbook:Pickling|pickled]] food . It's one of the Japanese traditional foods and it has been popular in Japan. It is red, round, and its taste ranges from sour to sweet.
Texture ranges from dry and crunchy to saturated and globby, depending on the method it was preserved.

==Ingredients==
*Japanese plums
*Red shiso
*Salts

==How to make umeboshi==
#Wash Japanese plums and wipe them dry. 
#Remove their stems. 
#Put salt and newly destemmed plums in the jar.
#Turn them repeatedly and vigorously.
#Put on inner lid.
#Place big, heavy rock on top of lid to increase the pressuring done to the plums.
#Wait until the water increases in the jar.
#Weather the Japanese plums for 3 days and 3 nights of sunny day in high summer. (Don't throw away the water in the jar.)
#During step #8, rub salt into red shiso to remove scum.
#Put the Japanese plums and red shiso into the jar with the water.

See below for more unusual ideas.

==Procedure==

===Beans===
#If using dried beans, wash them and examine them for any rocks, then soak overnight in plenty of water. Discard the soak water before cooking - your pot plants will love it!
#Cook the beans until soft:
#*If using a stove-top method, [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]] them in lots of water until they are very soft. You'll need to cook the beans a very long time on very low heat. You may add salt or black pepper to the water. You may add onion halves or a [[Cookbook:Ham|ham]] bone, which you can remove at the end. Changing the water from time to time will reduce the risk of [[w:Flatulence|gas]]. Expect the cooking to take at least 3 hours, if not 6 or more.
#*If using a [[Cookbook:Pressure Cooking|pressure cooker]], place the beans and some flavoring (typically [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]) in enough water to cover all the beans fully, and bring to pressure.  Keep the pressure for about 20 minutes, turn off the heat, and let the pressure fall naturally (about 15 minutes).

===Rice===
#If using rice, cook as steamed rice (usually 2 cups of water for every 1 cup of rice)
#Rinse rice well, until the water runs clear
#Add 2 cups of water per cup of rice, and bring to a boil, then reduce to the lowest heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes. 
#Set aside with the lid secured, for at least 5 minutes before use.

===All fillings===
#Get a large wide pot or tall-sided [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]].
#[[Cookbook:Sautéing|Sauté]] any onion or garlic in a little oil.
#Add uncooked meats to the pan and fry, stirring to ensure it browns all over. If using a ground (minced) meat, break it up as it cooks. Drain any excess grease. 
#Add any other well-cooked meat or beans. You'll might want to smash the beans, perhaps with a potato masher. When using beans alone, you might want to add up to 20% home-rendered [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]] (lard substitutions are obvious, but will lack flavor).
#Add spices and other flavorings as necessary.
#Add tomatoes, and cooked rice if using it. Reduce the heat. Simmer in open pan for about 40 minutes or until the liquid from the tomatoes is gone.
#Soften the tortillas by heating them up. Use a small amount of oil to prevent sticking, if heating in a pan that isn't non-stick. Cover with [[Cookbook:Aluminum Foil|aluminum foil]] if heating them in an [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]], to protect the tortillas from moisture loss.
#Place the filling mixture onto a tortilla. Add non-cooked fillings like cheese, olives, avocados, shredded lettuce, salsa.
#Roll up the tortilla. (and then make the next one, and so on)

===Rolling===
# Position your tortilla flat on a suitable surface such as a kitchen counter top. (12-[[w:inch|inch]] tortillas are suggested. If you can find bigger tortillas, use them!)
# Place your fillings on the flat tortilla in any order.
# Fold the bottom flap up. Ensure that there is a sufficient amount of tortilla used for the flap. A small flap will allow the fillings to escape, possibly falling in your lap and burning you.
# Bring the side up and over your filling. Tucking the edge of the tortilla under your filling is an excellent extra step. 
# Create a small fold with the remaining side of the tortilla. This is the ''key'' to maintaining burrito integrity. Failure is a given if you do not follow this step!  (The small, diagonal flap is an extra &quot;lock&quot; for the bottom flap of the tortilla… without it, the weight of the filling has the power to force the bottom flap right out of itself.) 
# Bring the remaining tortilla flap over the filling. Eat with confidence, though the fillings may be very hot.
# And remember to sing, &quot;... Taco-flavoured kisses! Taco, taco, burrito, burrito.&quot; Actual lyrics may vary depending on language, way in which the burritos are being prepared, or feelings toward the burrito.

==Variation==
The filling might be changed to involve any of the following:
* [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushroom]]s
* [[Cookbook:Chile|Anaheim chiles]] (mild canned green chiles)
* [[Cookbook:Jalapeño|Jalapeño pepper]] (spicier chiles)
* dried mild red chili peppers
* fresh diced onions
* fresh chopped garlic
* shredded [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]]
* other shredded cheeses such as [[Cookbook:Monterey Jack Cheese|jack]], soft Mexican cheese ([[w:Queso Blanco|Queso Blanco]], [[w:Oaxaca cheese|Oaxaca]], or [[w:Asadero cheese|Asadero]]) or other [[w:Farmer cheese|Farmer cheese]]
* [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]]
* [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|chili powder]]
* [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]
* small [[Cookbook:Shrimp|Shrimp]] (''Camarones'')
* Just about any other meat. Common ingredients in Mexican burritos include fried pork, fried [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]], beef [[Cookbook:Tongue|tongue]], beef [[Cookbook:Brain|brains]], ''birria'' ([[Cookbook:Goat|goat]] meat), [[Cookbook:Tripe|tripe]], and ''chicharrones'' (fried [[Cookbook:Pork Rind|pork rinds]], stewed)

Burritos, [[Cookbook:Taco|tacos]], [[Cookbook:Egg Roll|egg rolls]], [[Cookbook:Tamale|tamales]], and vegetable wraps have similar construction. The fillings and shells can be interchanged as desired.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Ethiopia|Cuisine of Ethiopia]]

'''Injera''' is a [[Cookbook:Flatbread|flatbread]] eaten in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Ethiopia|Ethiopia]] and neighbouring countries. It is made with [[Cookbook:teff|teff]]&amp;mdash;a tiny round grain that is grown in Ethiopia. While teff is very nutritious, pure teff flour contains no [[Cookbook:Gluten|gluten]], and little else in the way of binding proteins. This makes teff ill-suited for making raised bread, however injera still takes advantage of the special properties of [[Cookbook:Fermentation|fermentation]]. A short period of fermentation gives it an airy, bubbly texture, and also a sour taste.

==Ingredients==

* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Teff|teff flour]]
* 1½ cups [[Cookbook:Water|water]] (warm - but not hot!)
* a [[Cookbook:Pinch|pinch]] of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] for frying
* optional: fermentation starter (see notes)

==Procedure==
[[Image:Falasha gondar injera 2006.jpg|right|thumb|Making injera]]
# Mix the flour with the water, and the salt. Add your fermentation starter if using one (see notes).
# Set aside to ferment overnight, or at least 12 hours. There should be bubbles on the surface from fermenting, before you use it.
# Heat a large, flat [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|pan]] until it is hot enough to make a droplet of water sizzle. Oil it very lightly, just enough to make the pan shine.
# Pour or [[Cookbook:Ladle|ladle]] some batter onto the pan, spiralling outwards from the centre. Only a thin cover is required, a little thicker than a [[Cookbook:Crêpe|crêpe]] but not by much.
# As it cooks, the surface of the injera will become covered in holes or pits. When the entire injera has changed colour and the edges start to lift from the pan, remove it and set aside, then pour the next injera and repeat until finished.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* If you can't get it to ferment by itself, try a good fermentation starter like a teaspoonful of [[Cookbook:Kefir|kefir]]. [[Cookbook:Yeast|Baker's yeast]] alone will not make for good flavour, as bacteria are needed also, but a teaspoonful of [[Cookbook:Yoghurt|yoghurt]] plus a pinch of yeast might do the trick if you can't get kefir.
* Traditional injera is made with teff, however if this is difficult to get, it can be made with [[Cookbook:Sorghum|sorghum]] or [[Cookbook:Flour|wheat flour]].
* Since teff is often quite expensive outside of Africa, it is often mixed with wheat flour to give the injera some of the teff flavour but for less expense. Mix ¼ cup of teff flour with ¾ cup of sorghum or wheat flour, for the recipe above.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{mergefrom|Cookbook:Miso soup}}
{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Soup|Soup]] | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Cuisine of Japan]]

Miso soup is supposed to be served for breakfast every day.
It also should be served with meals.

==Ingredients==

* 90% to 94% [[Cookbook:Dashi|dashi]] (consider using instant dashi mix)
* 6% to 10% ''aka'' or ''shiro'' [[Cookbook:Miso|miso]]
* odds and ends for garnish

The garnish would typically be two items that contrast in color, flavor, buoyancy, shape, texture, etc. [[Cookbook:Wakame|Wakame]] with [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]] is pretty standard. Likely items for garnish would be:

* finely sliced and [[Cookbook:Deep Fat Fry|deep-fat fried]] [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]] (Agedashi tofu)
* finely cubed raw [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]] ('''recommended''')
* [[Cookbook:Wakame|wakame]] [[Cookbook:Seaweed|seaweed]] ('''recommended''')
* [[Cookbook:Konbu|konbu]] (kelp) seaweed, perhaps left over from making dashi
* [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]]
* chopped [[Cookbook:Scallion|scallion]]
* grated [[Cookbook:Daikon|daikon]] radish
* boiled and finely cubed [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]]
* [[Cookbook:Clam|clams]] (asari or shijimi)
* grated [[Cookbook:Eggplant|eggplant]]
* [[Cookbook:Shrimp|shrimp]]
* [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]]

==Procedure==
#Put dashi in a pot.
#Add any garnish that needs cooking.
#Heat the dashi, letting it simmer, cooking any garnish that needs cooking. (Do not boil it, as this degrades the flavor). 
#Add any garnish that does not need cooking, and remove from heat.
#Add the miso to the soup. (never boil the miso; this destroys the flavor)

Dashi is a broth used to make [[Cookbook:Miso Soup|miso soup]].

==Ingredients==

One or more of:

* dried [[Cookbook:Konbu|konbu]] (kelp) seaweed (''konbu'')
* [[Cookbook:Clam|clams]] (''asari'' or ''shijimi'')
* [[Cookbook:Bonito Flakes|dried bonito flakes]] (''katsuo-bushi'')
* [[Cookbook:Mackerel Flakes|dried mackerel flakes]] (''sababushi'')
* dried [[Cookbook:Sardine|sardines]] or [[Cookbook:Anchovy|anchovies]] (''niboshi'')
* dried shiittake mushroom [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]] (''hoshi-shiitake'')

* dried young &quot;flying fishes&quot; (飛魚;''tobiuo'' or あご;''ago'',unique name to Japanese-oceanside.)

==Procedure==
#If using sardines or anchovies, rip off the heads and rip out the guts. Discard these, keeping the bodies.
#Boil stuff in water, as if you were making tea.
#Filter the liquid or scoop the solids out of it. The liquid is your dashi.

When only kelp (''konbu'') is used, you get ''kombu-dashi''. This is bland, and appears to be unpopular for use in miso soup. A chunk of kelp about 6 inches across might be reasonable for a [[Cookbook:Quart|quart]] of broth.

When sardines or anchovies also used, you get ''niboshi-dashi''. This seems to be the most popular choice for making [[Cookbook:Miso Soup|miso soup]]. You might add a bit of [[Cookbook:Sake|sake]] in this case. About 10 little [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]] (guppy-sized) per [[Cookbook:Quart|quart]] of broth should do.

When both kelp (''konbu'') and bonito flakes (''katsuo-bushi'') are used, you get ''katsuobushi-dashi''. This appears to be the second most popular choice for making miso soup. About 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] of bonito flakes per [[Cookbook:Quart|quart]] of broth should do. At first you produce primary dashi (''ichiban-dashi''). This is good for clear soups. If you use the solids a second time, you get secondary dashi (''niban-dashi''). This is good for thick soups and for cooking vegetables.

These are soft pretzels.

==Ingredients==

* 4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|t]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|T]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1 package [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]] (1/4 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] active dry yeast, 2.25 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|t]] dry yeast, or one 0.6 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] yeast cake)
* 1.5 cups warm water
* [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] white (or beaten whole egg)
* coarse [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] (margarita or kosher salt)

==Procedure==

#Dissolve the yeast in the water
#Mix in the salt, sugar, and flour
#Knead the dough until it is smooth
#Roll out (do not cut) a blob of dough until it is about 18 [[Cookbook:Inch|inches]] long.
#If a traditional shape is desired: Make a loop with the middle of the dough, crossing the dough over itself at about the 15% and 85% areas. Give this contact point a 180° twist, then flip it (and the ends) over toward the middle of the dough piece so that the ends overlap the more-central part at about the 45% and 55% areas.
#Brush the pretzel with egg.
#Sprinkle coarse salt onto the egg.
#Bake at [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|425°F]] for 15 minutes.

'''Tempura''' is one of the fried foods of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japan]]. Various [[Cookbook:Meat|meats]], [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]], and [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]] are dipped in [[Cookbook:Batter|batter]] and then [[Cookbook:Deep-fat Frying|deep fried]] until lightly golden.

==Ingredients==
* 1 [[Cookbook:egg|egg]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:cup|cup]] ice cold water
* 1 cup all-purpose [[Cookbook:flour|flour]]
* Enough oil to fry food

==Procedure==
# Heat cooking oil (peanut oil is best) in a deep pan to 340 - 350° F (~171 - 176°C)
# Beat the egg in a bowl and add ice cold water (warmer water will produce a sticky batter and more oily tempura).
# Add flour and mix lightly. Do not overmix batter (a few lumps actually improve the result, adding crispiness).
# Dip meat or vegetables briefly in the batter and fry until brown.
# Remove from the oil and drain.
# Serve hot.

If using [[Cookbook:Shrimp|shrimp]], score them a few times crosswise on the underside, to prevent them from curling up during [[Cookbook:Deep-fat Frying|deep frying]]. Alternatively, [[Cookbook:Skewering|skewer]] them before cooking. Remove the skewers before serving.

Serve over white [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] garnished with black [[Cookbook:Sesame Seed|sesame seeds]], in a bowl of [[Cookbook:Udon Noodle Soup|udon noodle soup]], or in a bowl of [[Cookbook:Soba Noodle Soup|soba noodle soup]]. Serving in [[Cookbook:Soup|soup]] makes the breading get mushy of course.

Sponge cake is the most commonly recognised variety of baked confectionery in Britain. It has a sweet taste, often flavoured with vanilla, chocolate or other additions, and can be cut and displayed in a number of different ways.

An [[Cookbook:Sponge Cake|easier version of this recipe]] is available that does not require a kitchen scale.

==Ingredients==
===For the cake===
* 2 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]], USDA large (2 to 2.25 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]], 56.6 to 63.7 [[Cookbook:g|g]]) or EU size M (53 to 63 [[Cookbook:g|g]])
'''Important: Weigh the eggs and substitute ''n'' for the eggs' weight.''' 
* self-raising [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] (''n'')
* [[Cookbook:Caster sugar|caster sugar]] (''n'')
* butter (''n'')
* sodium bicarbonate (2tsp) (baking powder, baking soda or bicarbonate of soda)

====Extras (optional)====
* [[Cookbook:vanilla|vanilla extract]] (1-2 tsp)
* food colouring (a few drops)
* chocolate powder (unsweetened baking cocoa) (according to taste. Use 3g less flour for every 4g added.)

===Filling===
Choose one of these to spread between two cakes if making a cake with more than two eggs.
* 2-4 tbsp jam (softened with pallette knife or similar) or
* buttercream (cream together 100g caster sugar and 100g butter)

===Dredging===
One of the following:
* 75g icing sugar (superfine)
* 70g caster sugar (fine)
* 65g granulated sugar (medium)
* 55g [[Cookbook:Demerara sugar|demerara sugar]] (large crunchy crystals)

==Equipment==
* 1 large mixing bowl
* 1 set of scales
* 1 wooden spoon

==Method==
#Preheat an oven to 200 degrees Centigrade.

===Preparation===
#Cream together the sugar and butter in the mixing bowl. They should achieve a creamy texture with quite a thick consistency. The longer, harder and faster the butter and sugar are creamed the lighter the cake will be when cooked.
#Add both eggs and mix well.
#Add all the flour and mix well.
#Add any food colouring, flavouring, etc. at this point. If you add liquid ingredients, add the same volume again of sugar and flour mix to compensate. If adding dry ingredients, ensure to use 3g less flour for every 4g of extra dry ingredients added.
#Beat with wooden spoon in a circular motion, trying to incorporate as much air as possible.

===Cooking===
#Grease one or two cake tins with butter.
#Spoon, then scrape, as much cake mixture as possible into the tins. If using two tins, try to ensure that each tin contains an equal amount of cake mixture and is not more than 3/4 filled.
#Put the tins into the oven and leave them for approximately 10 minutes before checking them. The cooking time should reach around 15 minutes: keep checking them regularly after about 8 minutes since all ovens vary.

===Post-cooking===

====One cake====
#Turn the cake out onto a wire rack to cool.
#When cool, dredge with sugar using a spoon.

====Two or more cakes====
#Turn the cakes out onto a wire rack to cool.
#When cool, turn one of them upside down and spread your filling onto it.
#Place the other cake (top up) onto the upside-down cake and dredge the cake with sugar using a spoon.

'''Ketchup''', sometimes known as '''catsup''', is a term used for a type of [[Cookbook:Sauces|sauce]] containing [[Cookbook:Spices|spices]] and a large amount of acid ([[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]] or [[Cookbook:Lactic Acid|lactic acid]]), typically [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]]-based. Some recipes, particularly those from [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Australia|Australia]], may use the ambiguous term [[Cookbook:Tomato Sauce|tomato sauce]] to mean tomato ketchup.

Ketchup is commonly used on [[Cookbook:Deep Fat Frying|deep fat fried]] foods, [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]], and  [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]. Ketchup is normally applied at the table as a condiment, but it is also commonly used as an ingredient for [[Cookbook:Meatloaf|meatloaf]] and [[Cookbook:Barbecue Sauce|barbecue sauce]].

Interestingly, the original ketchup did not include tomatoes. It was probably a Chinese sauce called &quot;ke-tsiap&quot;, based on [[Cookbook:Fermentation|fermented]] [[Cookbook:Brining|brined]] fish or shellfish. The sauce was brought back to Europe by sailors, and appropriated into local recipes. Later, tomatoes were added.

==Ingredients==

* 1 [[Cookbook:Peck|peck]] tomatoes (approximately 8 quarts/950ml)
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (120g) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] dry [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]]
* 1 tablespoon ground [[Cookbook:Allspice|allspice]]
* 2 cups [[Cookbook:Cider vinegar|cider vinegar]]
* 3 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] ground [[Cookbook:Clove|cloves]]

==Preparation==
Select good, ripe tomatoes. Scald and strain through a coarse sieve to remove seed and skin. Measure 1 gallon (3.8 litres). When the tomatoes become cold add the remaining ingredients. Let simmer slowly for 3 hours. Pour into hot sterilized 1-pint jars and seal. Process for 15 minutes in boiling water bath. Add 5 minutes processing time for altitudes from 1,001 to 6,000 feet (300 - 1800 metres), and another 5 minutes if over 6,000 feet (1800 metres).

==Ingredients== 
*3 large [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
*2 medium (10 oz) slices of cooked [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]]
*2 12-oz slices of American [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] of [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;

==Equipment==
*10&quot; Non-stick [[Cookbook:Frying pan|skillet]]
*Non-stick [[Cookbook:Spatula|spatula]]
*[[Cookbook:Fork|Fork]] or [[Cookbook:Whisk|whisk]]
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;

==Procedure==
#Cut or break bacon into one-inch pieces.
#Cut or break slices of cheese into one-inch-wide strips.
#Beat or whisk eggs until evenly colored.
#Heat pan over high heat until butter is melted and spread over entire pan surface.
#Turn heat to medium, pour in eggs, and rotate the pan so that eggs cover the entire surface of the pan.
#Continue rotating until the edges become thick, then use a spatula to draw back a downside edge allowing the remaining liquid egg to flow to the pan and start cooking.  Continue to rotate the pan and move the spatula to adjacent areas until most of the liquid egg is cooked.
#Lay the cheese down the center of the omelet.
#Place the bacon on top of the cheese.
#Flip one side over the bacon and cheese strip, then the other.
#Turn to low heat and serve when cheese has melted.

'''Lancashire Hotpot''', originating from [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|England]], is a very easy but delicious dish that consists of lamb, onions, potatoes and the cook's choice of [[Cookbook:Herbs|herbs]]. This is [[Cookbook:Baking|baked]] in an oven.

==Ingredients==
*2 [[Cookbook:Pound|lb]] (900[[Cookbook:g|g]]) neck of [[Cookbook:Lamb|lamb]]
*2 large [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]
*1 large or 2 small [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]](s)
*choice of mixed [[Cookbook:Herbs|herbs]]
*500 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]] boiling water

==Procedure==
Dice the lamb and set aside. Preheat [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]] to [[Cookbook:Oven_Temperatures|325F / 170C / Gas Mark 3]].

Slice the potatoes and dice the onions. Add a layer of the potatoes to the bottom of a casserole dish, and cover with a handful of the diced onion. Layer the diced lamb over the top of this, sprinkling with your choice of herbs. Repeat these layers until the dish is full. Top with a final layer of the potatoes.

Pour boiling water into the dish until filled - if more water is needed, continue to add until topped. Bake for at least one hour, though traditionally the dish was left baking all day.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*A handful of mixed [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]] such as [[Cookbook:Parsnip|parsnips]], [[Cookbook:Turnip|turnips]], [[Cookbook:Leek|leek]] or [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]] can be added to the dish. It is worth experimenting to find out what combination of flavours you prefer.
*The dish was once cooked with [[Cookbook:Oyster|oyster]]s when they were more affordable.
*Flavour can be improved by adding a stock cube to the boiling water.
*A [[Cookbook:Suet|suet]] crust can be applied to the hotpot an hour before cooking time is finished.
*Many people like to add in small quantities of instant gravy granules to add a little flavour to the dish.

'''Spaghetti alla Carbonara''' literally means &quot;Spaghetti in the Manner of the Charcoal Maker&quot;. Some believe that the dish was once popular with Charcoal makers who lived on the Mountains near Rome because the ingredients were easily portable and cooking was fairly uncomplicated. Others believe the dish derives its name from all the freshly ground pepper that is added to the spaghetti at the last minute. 
Actually, the origin of the dish is quite recent, since it was unknown before Second World War. 
The dish uses pancetta or guanciale, which are similar to bacon. If you want to stay true to the Roman heritage of the dish, you must use grated Pecorino Romano cheese, but it can be substituted by Parmesan. A mix of the two cheeses is also common.

Most Anglo-American recipes add cream to the dish.&lt;ref&gt;Herbst, Sharon Tyler. ''Food Lover's Companion, Third Edition'': Comprehensive Definitions of nearly 6000 food, drink, and culinary terms. &amp;copy;2001 Barron's Educational Series. Hauppauge, New York. [http://www.barronseduc.com Barron's website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OnCooking&quot;&gt;Labensky, Sarah R. &amp; Alan M. House. ''On Cooking, Third Edition'': Techniques from expert chefs. &amp;copy;2003, Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is not how the original Roman/Italian dish is made, however.&lt;ref&gt;Gossetti Della Salda, Anna. ''Le Ricette regionali Italiane''. &amp;copy;1965 Solares, Milan.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ingredients==
*[[Cookbook:Pasta|spaghetti]]: 1 lb (450g)
*[[Cookbook:Pancetta|pancetta]]: ½ lb (225g)
*[[Cookbook:Egg yolk|egg yolks]]: 5
*[[Cookbook:Pecorino Romano Cheese|Pecorino]] or Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, grated: 1½ cups (360ml)
*[[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]], extra-virgin: 3-4 tablespoons
*[[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]], freshly ground: ½ tablespoon
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

==[[Cookbook:Utensil|Utensils]]==
*large pot
*large skillet
*bowl
*measuring cups and spoons
*fork

==Preparation==
#Dice the pancetta into small pieces (1 inch [2.5cm] will do).
#The Pot: Bring a big pot of water to a boil and add salt when it begins to simmer.
#The Pot: Cook the spaghetti until it is [[Cookbook:al dente|al dente]] and drain it, reserving ½ cup of water.
#The Skillet: Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over a medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the pancetta and cook for about 10 minutes over a low flame until the pancetta has rendered most of its fat but is still chewy and barely browned.
#The Bowl: In a bowl, slowly whisk about ½ cup of the pasta water into the egg yolks, using a fork. Add the Parmesan cheese and pepper. Mix with a fork.
#The Skillet: Transfer the spaghetti immediately to the skillet with the pancetta. Toss it and turn off the heat. Add the egg mixture to the skillet with the pasta and toss all the ingredients to coat the pasta. Taste the pasta and add salt and black pepper, if necessary.

==Beverages==
Ideally this dish is served with a red   [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]] (Merlot, Chianti, Montepulciano d’Abruzzo), allowed to decant for several hours, and served at 65°F (18°C).

The Spanish tortilla is one of the best-known Spanish dishes, and it would be very rare to find a tapas bar that does not offer the Spanish tortilla.  This tapa is versatile, and other ingredients such as mushrooms, tomatoes, and peppers can be added to create variety.  The Spanish tortilla can be served warm or cold, and is often topped with mayonnaise or tomato sauce.

==Ingredients==
*1[[Cookbook:Pound|lb]]/450[[Cookbook:g|g]] waxy [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]
*1 large white/Spanish [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]] (optional)
*About 1 [[Cookbook:L|liter]] of [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] - ''Olive oil is best''
*6 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
*pinch [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

== Recipe ==
#Peel and slice potatoes. The slices should be quite thin.
#Meanwhile, heat the oil on a low heat in a large [[Cookbook:Sauté Pan|sauté pan]]
#Add the potatoes to the sauté pan, and fry until soft and cooked through, but '''not browned'''. This can take quite a while - don't rush it. It is a good idea to keep the pan covered - that way the steam from the potatoes at the bottom of the pan helps cook the ones at the top.
#Slice the onion thinly. [[Cookbook:Frying|Fry]] it lightly in [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]], stirring frequently for a few minutes or until sweet. Or you can simply add them to the potatoes for the last five minutes of cooking.
#Beat the eggs in a large bowl and add salt
#Add the hot cooked potatoes and onion to the egg in the bowl, gently mix the potatoes and onion into the egg and leave it for five minutes. This starts the egg cooking and helps cover the potato slices in egg so it all sticks together nicely.
#Drain oil, and reserve oil for another time.
#Pour the potatoes, onion and egg mix back into the pan, and cook for about 5 minutes on a low heat. Keep the pan moving so the mix doesn't stick to the pan. A non-stick pan makes this much easier.
#When the edge of the tortilla looks cooked place a large, flat plate over the pan (like a lid), put one hand on the plate to hold it in place and turn the whole thing over (the first few times you do this it is best do this over the sink - can be very messy)
# You should now have an up-side-down omelette on your plate - cooked on top - raw underneath. Check the pan is clean and scrape any bits that have stuck in the pan off and add a bit of oil if it is looking dry. Now slide the omelette back into the pan to cook the bottom.
#Cook for another few minutes,
#Repeat the turning trick a couple of times (practice makes perfect) to make sure it is cooked evenly.
#Then serve onto large plate, cut into wedges, and serve with more [[Cookbook:Tapa|tapas]]. Sliced tomatoes, fresh bread and mayo make it into a great meal.

These cookies can be considered '''gingerbread cookies''', and originally were named as such. They resemble the '''molasses cookies''' made by Archway; they use relatively little [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]] and are thus not as spicy hot as gingerbread cookies from many other recipes. They are usually somewhat soft and not at all gooey, being halfway between crumbly and chewy. They are generally not crisp, but can be slightly crisp if thoroughly cooked. The recipe works for both drop cookies and rolled cookies, with a bit of adjustment to the amount of flour.

The known history of this recipe starts from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eavesdropping eavesdropping] on a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_line party-line] telephone during the early 1900s. The age of this recipe appears to explain many odd features. At the time, [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]] did not exist. Thus this recipe uses [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]], with [[Cookbook:Sour Milk|sour milk]] (now created via [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]], so don't panic) as the acid. Ginger would have been expensive. The recipe originally called for an undefined amount of [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] that turned out to be around 8 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] (1/2 [[Cookbook:Gallon|gallon]]), which would feed a family of a dozen or so. The recipe has been cut in half for the benefit of less-productive parents.

==Ingredients==

[[Image:Molasses-Cookies-2006March09.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Molasses cookies made from this recipe.]]

*1/2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|T]] [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
*1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|c]] [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] (minus 1/2 T for the vinegar)
*1/2 c [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1/2 c [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]] (see ''variation'' below if substitution is desired)
*1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
*1 c [[Cookbook:Molasses|molasses]]
*4 c [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] (approximate upper limit; see instructions below)
*2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|t]] [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]]
*1/4 t [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*1/4 t [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
*toppings: [[Cookbook:Walnut|walnuts]], [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]], etc.

==Procedure==

[[Image:Molasses-Cookies-In-Progress-2006March09.JPG|thumb|right|200px|In progress: the drop variety, with about 3c flour total, being pressed with a sugar-covered clay stamp.]]

#Grease some [[Cookbook:Cookie Sheet|cookie sheets]].
#Prepare 3 mixtures:
#*the vinegar, plus enough milk to make 1/2 c (alternately, use real sour milk)
#*the baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, and 2.5 c (not all 4 c) of flour
#*the sugar and shortening creamed together, then also adding in the egg and molasses (use a large bowl)
#To the sugar+shortening+egg+molasses mixture, alternately mix in small amounts of the other two mixtures until everything is in one bowl. Mix this well.
#Bit by bit, mix in more flour as needed. For drop cookies, you might not add any more. For rolled cookies produced without refrigeration, you are likely to need an extra 1.5 c for a total of 4 c. Refrigeration can reduce this slightly.
#Form the cookies
#*If making drop cookies, plop some batter onto a cookie sheet. Using a bit of sugar to prevent sticking, squish the cookie with a glass. Push some walnut pieces into the top of the cookie.
#*If making rolled cookies, you may wish to refrigerate the batter. Plop a [[Cookbook:Pint|pint]]-sized blob of batter onto a flour-dusted surface. Dust the top of the dough with flour as you squish it down, then roll it out. A cold marble [[Cookbook:Rolling Pin|rolling pin]] is suggested. Cut out shapes, then place them on the cookie sheet. The unused dough may be put back into the mix; note that this increases the proportion of flour.
#Cook for 8 to 10 minutes at [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|375°F]]

==Variation==
[[Cookbook:Butter|Butter]] seems to work OK in place of the [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]], with a bit of heating to soften it up. In a 1-[[Cookbook:Pound|pound]] package with 4 sticks, 1 stick is about 1/2 c. [[Cookbook:Lard|Lard]] should be an even better substitute.

'''Hot and Sour Soup''' is a popular soup served at Chinese restaurants in the United States. This version tastes exactly like that served at various Chinese restaurants in California.

==Ingredients==
For the soup:
* 4 cups of [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] [[Cookbook:Stock|stock or broth]] (or 4 cups water and 4 chicken bouillon cubes)
* 3 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]
* 1/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] cooked shredded chicken or [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]]
* 1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]], diced
* 1/2 tablespoon garlic chili sauce
* 1/4 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] ground white [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* 1/4 cup white [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
* 1/3 cup canned [[Cookbook:Bamboo Shoots|bamboo shoots]], [[Cookbook:Julienne|julienned]]
* 3 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] block of [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]], cut into 1/4 inch dice
* 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]] and 2 tablespoons cold water
* 1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]], beaten
* 2 [[Cookbook:Scallion|green onion]] stalks, diced (including tops)
* 1/2 teaspoon toasted [[Cookbook:Sesame Oil|sesame oil]]

==Procedure==

# Bring chicken broth to a simmer in a 2-quart saucepan.
# Add soy sauce, shredded meat, mushrooms and garlic chili sauce.
# Simmer for five minutes.
# Add white pepper, white vinegar, bamboo shoots, tofu.
# Simmer for five minutes.
# Combine two tablespoons of cornstarch with two tablespoons of cold water in a cup. Stir until mixture is smooth. Add cornstarch mixture to soup and stir well.
# Simmer for five minutes until soup is thickened.
# Beat egg in a cup until yolk and white are combined. Pour beaten egg slowly, in a fine stream into soup. Stir soup several times.
# Wait 30 seconds.
# Add green onions and sesame oil to soup. Stir well. Remove from heat.
# Serve hot.

Makes 4 servings.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
* Adjust vinegar, ground white pepper, garlic chili sauce and soy sauce to taste.  American vinegar is much more acidic than its Chinese counterpart, so start with very little and add slowly.
* Add or remove mushrooms, bamboo shoots, or tofu as needed. These three ingrediants don't add much to the taste, mostly they add to the texture of the soup.

'''Chipped beef on toast''' is slivers of meat in a creamy [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce]],  served on [[Cookbook:Toast|toasted bread]]. In military slang it is commonly referred to as &quot;Shit On a Shingle&quot; (SOS). [[Cookbook:Chipped Beef|Chipped beef]] is a dried, smoked, and salted meat product, generally sold wadded up in jars or flat in plastic packets.

The 1910 edition of the ''Manual for Army Cooks'' provides the following recipe, for a quantity sufficient for 60 men.

This recipe left out an important step---soaking the beef to reduce the salt content.  Later recipes were creamier.  See http://www.seabeecook.com/cookery/cooking/cooking_sos.htm

==Ingredients==

*15 [[Cookbook:Pound|pounds]] (6.8[[Cookbook:Kg|kg]]) [[Cookbook:Chipped Beef|chipped beef]]
*1 pound (450[[Cookbook:Gram|g]]) of [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]], [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] preferred
*1¼ [[Cookbook:Pound|lbs]] (560g) of [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*2 12-oz cans of [[Cookbook:Condensed milk|evaporated milk]]
*1 bunch [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]]
*¼ [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] (7g) [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
*6 [[Cookbook:Quart|quarts]] (6[[Cookbook:Liter|l]]) [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] [[Cookbook:Stock|stock]]

==Procedure==

# Brown the flour in the melted fat. 
# Dissolve the milk in the beef stock, and then add that to the pot. 
# Stir this together slowly to prevent lumping, and then add the beef. 
# Cook for a few minutes, add the parsley, and serve over toast.

'''Bubble Tea''' - a tea beverage with tapioca pearl (dark black balls) mixed in.

==Ingredients==
*½ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] cooked bubble tea ([[Cookbook:Tapioca Pearls|tapioca]]) pearls: cook pearls according to the instruction on the package
*1 cup crushed [[Cookbook:ice|ice]]
*1 cup very strong chilled black [[Cookbook:Tea|tea]]

==Procedure==
#Place pearls in a large parfait glass,
#Combine all remaining ingredients in a cocktail shaker,
#Shake vigorously until mixture is frothy
#Pour into glass and serve with large-diameter straws. 
You can just combine all the ingredients together without shaking it vigorously if you don't want it frothy or bubble.

Makes a 16 [[Cookbook:Fluid Ounce|ounce]] (473 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) drink. Note however, that the ingredients total up to at least 28 ounces (828 mL).

'''Spanakopita''' is a [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Greece|Greek]] ''spinach pie''. This recipe serves 8.
[[Image:Spanokopita_cropped.jpg|right|thumb|250 px|a slice of Spanakopita.]]

==Ingredients==
*2 [[Cookbook:Pound|lbs.]] fresh [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]] (or equivalent amount frozen, thawed, and drained)
*1 large [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], finely chopped
*¼ [[Cookbook:Cup|C]] extra virgin [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*1 C   [[Cookbook:Chopping|chopped]] [[Cookbook:Green onion|scallions]]
*½ C [[Cookbook:Mincing|minced]] fresh [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|T]]   minced fresh [[Cookbook:Dill|dill]]
*¼ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|t]] freshly ground [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]]
*1 T   [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]
*¾ C crumbled [[Cookbook:Feta Cheese|feta cheese]]
*¾ C small curd [[Cookbook:Cottage Cheese|cottage cheese]]
*¼ C freshly grated [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|parmesan cheese]]
*4 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]], beaten
*12-20 sheets [[filo|phyllo pastry]]
*⅔ C [[Cookbook:Ghee|clarified butter]]

==Procedure==
*Remove large stems from spinach, wash, chop, lightly steam, drain, pressing out any liquid with the back of a spoon.
*Place onions and oil in large skillet. Cook over medium heat until slightly tender. Add scallions and cook until limp. Remove from heat and stir in parsley, dill, and nutmeg.
*To the skillet, add the cheeses, spinach, and lemon juice. Mix and add eggs. Mix again gently.
*To assemble the Spanakopita, brush a shallow 9x12 inch baking dish with some of the clarified butter. Layer about 5 sheets of phyllo, one at a time, covering bottom of dish, sides, and draping over edges. Brush butter in between layers. Fill with half of spinach filling. Add 3-5 more phyllo sheets, brushing butter in between layers. Add remaining spinach filling and top with all remaining phyllo sheets, brushing butter between sheets. Roll up and create a lip with all overhanging phyllo sheets. crumble any broken sheet bits on top. Drizzle any remaining clarified butter over top. Bake for 45 min. at 350°F or 180°C. Spanakopita is done when puffed and golden. Let sit for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.
*I usually double or triple this recipe and make 2 huge baking dishes. This is just as fabulous as a leftover.
*Instead of phyllo pastry, my Greek mother-in-law taught me to use pizza dough purchased from the supermarket dairy section as a quick and delicious alternative.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Sandwiches|Sandwiches]]

The '''b'''acon, '''l'''ettuce and '''t'''omato sandwich, commonly referred to as the '''BLT''', is a classic sandwich that can be found almost everywhere.

==Ingredients==
*[[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]], sliced in rashers
*[[Cookbook:Lettuce|lettuce]], washed and shredded, torn, or in whole leaves
*ripe [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]], sliced into thin disks
*two slices of any type of [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]
*sandwich spread or condiments (e.g., [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]], [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]], [[Cookbook:cream cheese|cream cheese]], or [[Cookbook:mustard|mustard]], although mayonnaise is traditional)
*ground [[Cookbook:black pepper|black pepper]], if desired

==Procedures==
#[[Cookbook:Toasting|Toast]] the two slices of bread.
#While the bread is toasting [[Cookbook:Broiling|broil]] or [[Cookbook:Frying|fry]] the bacon until crisp, taking care not to burn it.
#Once the toasted bread is ready, spread with desired condiments.
#Layer one slice of toast with the lettuce, tomato slices, and bacon. Add black pepper as desired. Top with other slice of toast.
#Cut into triangles or halves as preferred. Serve immediately.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*The lettuce, if shredded, may be mixed with the mayonnaise before layering the toast.
*The lettuce may be omitted, or another green substituted. [[Cookbook:watercress|Watercress]] is a nice addition.
*You may add slivers of ripe [[Cookbook:avocado|avocado]] or raw or cooked red [[Cookbook:onion|onion]] to the sandwich, or may substitute them for the lettuce or tomato.
*You may top the hot bacon in the sandwich with a slice of [[Cookbook:cheese|cheese]], such as [[Cookbook:muenster|muenster]] or [[Cookbook:pepper jack|pepper jack]].
*You may place a fried [[Cookbook:egg|egg]] in the sandwich. If the egg is fried over-easy or sunny-side-up, the egg's [[Cookbook:yolk|yolk]] may be broken just before serving so that it dresses the contents of the sandwich. 
*The slices of bread do not need to be toasted, although toast adds a nice texture.
*You may spread the bread with [[Cookbook:peanut_butter|peanut butter]] for an interesting variation.
*You may top the sandwich or its contents with [[Cookbook:Hollandaise_Sauce|hollandaise sauce]].
*Add [[Cookbook:ham|ham]], [[Cookbook:turkey|turkey]] and [[Cookbook:swiss cheese|swiss cheese]] for a BLT [[Cookbook:club_sandwich|club sandwich]].
*For a [[Cookbook:vegan|vegan]] variation on the BLT, use marinated and fried or grilled strips of [[Cookbook:tempeh|tempeh]] to substitute for the bacon. Vegetable protein-based false bacon products are also available in some grocery freezers. Use Nayonaise, a vegan mayonnaise substitute, in place of the mayo.

==Warnings==
Take care when frying the bacon to avoid a grease fire. (Should one occur, '''do not''' douse the flames with water; instead, cover the pan tightly or heap with baking soda to smother the flames, and remove from the heat.)

Atchar is a spicy condiment, often eaten with a curry. It comes from the Indian cuisine in South Africa. In India, it is spelled Achar, and the word means pickle in Hindi. Usually the atchar made in South Africa is made with unripe green mangoes and chillies. The whole mango is used for making atchar.

This traditional mango atchar is easily made at home. Adjust the amount of chillies to your liking and serve with a vegetable curry, or on a slice of white bread.

== Ingredients ==

* 1.5 kg unripe mangoes, chopped
* 4 tsp garlic and herb salt
* 3 Tbs chilli powder
* 2 Tbs cumin powder
* 1 Tbs ground coriander
* 3 Tbs curry powder
* 1.5 cups (360ml) raw honey or fructose
* 2 cups (480ml) balsamic vinegar
* 0.5 cup (120g) corn or potato flour
* 2 Tbs mustard seeds
* handful curry leaves
* 1.5 cups (360ml) virgin olive oil or cold pressed sunflower oil

==Procedure==
Simmer all the ingredients except the mangoes and the oil, until it thickens. Pour over the mangoes, add the oil, mix well, cool and refrigerate for at least 12 hours.

'''Simple Egg Noodles'''

==Ingredients==
*1 whole [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] 
*1 cups [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*2 to 6 tablespoons of [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
*1-2 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Olive oil|olive oil]] (optional)

==Procedure==

On a smooth surface, heap flour. Push a hole in the center of the flour (it should look like a volcano). Break egg into flour (add oil now if you choose to do so - it will change the flavor and texture). Either knead with hands or mix with a fork. Slowly add water one teaspoon at a time while kneading the dough. You probably will not need all six tablespoons of water (though you may possibly need more). Knead dough until it has a consistant texture.

===Manually===
Divide dough into manageable sections. Select one section at a time and keep the rest covered. Roll each section to desired thickness and cut into noodles with a knife.

===Pasta Machine===
Divide dough into manageable sections. Select one section at a time and keep the rest covered. Roll dough through smooth rollers repeatedly at progressively thinner settings. When the dough reaches desired thickness, cut with grooved rollers.

==Use==
These noodles can be laid out to dry for later use or dropped immediatly into a boiling pot of water. Cook to taste. They are good with a variety of sauces.

==Notes==
I would recommend using a pasta machine as it drastically speeds up the process. Ingredients can be multiplied without changing the instructions. One tip for success, the drier you can keep the dough, the better it will come out. If the dough gets too wet it will stick to itself and cook down to one blob.

'''Focaccia''' is a type of flat bread popular in Italy, but probably adopted from [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Greece|Greece]]. The basic bread is often topped with any of the following: [[Cookbook:Herbs|herbs]], [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]], [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]], [[Cookbook:Meat|meats]], and [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]], and can be seen as a precursor to pizza. Focaccia is commonly used for [[Cookbook:Sandwiches|sandwiches]].

Makes 1 loaf.

==Ingredients==
[[Image:Focaccia.png|thumb|right|Focaccia bread]]
* 3 1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] all-purpose [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:White Sugar|white sugar]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] active dry [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]]

# Combine 1 cup flour, sugar, salt, and yeast. Mix well.
# Heat water and vegetable oil until warm, and add to yeast mixture along with the egg. 
# Blend with an electric [[Cookbook:Mixer|mixer]] at low speed until moistened. [[Cookbook:Beating|Beat]] for 2 additional minutes.
# Stir in 1 3/4 cup flour ('''note: half of total''') while beating, until dough pulls away from side of bowl.
# Knead in 3/4 cup flour on floured surface. Cover dough with a bowl, and let sit for 5 minutes.
# Place dough on a greased [[Cookbook:Baking Sheet|baking sheet]]. Roll out to 12-[[Cookbook:Inch|inch]] circle. Cover with greased plastic wrap and a cloth towel. Place in a warm place for 30 minutes.
# Uncover dough, and poke holes in it with a spoon handle at 1 inch intervals. Drizzle olive oil on dough, and sprinkle with crushed rosemary.
# Bake at [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|400°F (205°C)]] for 17 to 27 minutes, until just golden. Remove from baking sheet, and cool on rack.

[[Image:Milk clouds in tea.jpeg|thumb|right]]
'''A nice cup of tea''' is the usual answer in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Ireland|Ireland]] to any everyday problem. Nothing is so bad that a nice cup of [[Cookbook:Tea|tea]] with a friend or family member can't make it better.

Here's a traditionalist view on how to make it, which shares much with an essay of the same name by George Orwell.

Use freshly drawn water and bring it to a boil in a kettle. Meanwhile, prepare your teapot. A stainless steel pot may be used, but earthenware is preferred. The pot should be warmed: add some hot water and let the warmth pervade the pot. Drain off the hot water, then add the tea. Remember to take the pot to the water, never the water to the pot.  Whatever tea you use (and for proper emotional rescue you should use a strong Indian or Kenyan-based blend), do not use teabags. You need to let the tea leaves swim free and with teabags there will inevitably be a papery tinge to the taste. This rule is, however, widely broken.

[[Image:Tea bags.jpg|thumb|left|Use teabags for convenience...]]
Measure tea according to the size of the  teapot and the strength of tea you prefer. In a large teapot (serving four cups), two [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] will give a fairly weak tea, perhaps enough to console one for a lost umbrella on a rainy day, and four should be strong enough for being stood up on a Friday night. A broken heart may need six. Add the water as soon as it boils, and leave it to stand for five minutes (and no longer) before serving. Use a mug if you must, but a cup with a saucer is far more civilised.

[[Image:Lipton Earl Grey in tin.jpg|thumb|right|...Or the traditional loose leaves for best flavor.]]
Traditionally you should add full-cream milk, but semi-skimmed will do. If you are familiar with the strength of tea you make and the size of the cups, you can follow the 'milk in first' technique. Otherwise, add milk to the tea, to ensure you get the right colour. Add sugar according to taste and the extent of the emotional crisis you are trying to overcome.

Serve with a biscuit or two, and prepare to feel much better.

[[Image:Agedashi.jpg|right|frame|Agedashi tofu]]

'''Agedashi tofu''' (or '''''agedashi dofu''''') &amp;#25562;&amp;#12370;&amp;#20986;&amp;#12375;&amp;#35910;&amp;#33104;  is a simple [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japanese]] way to serve hot tofu. Silken (''kinugoshi'') firm tofu, cut into cubes, is lightly dusted with potato starch or cornstarch and then [[deep frying|deep fried]] until golden brown. It's then served in a hot tentsuyu broth made of dashi, mirin, and shoyu (Japanese soy sauce), and topped with finely chopped green onions or grated daikon. It is eaten with chopsticks.

==Ingredients==
* 4-6 oz. soft [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]]
* [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]]
* [[Cookbook:Oil|Oil]] for [[Cookbook:Deep frying|deep frying]]

;Sauce:
* ½ cup [[Cookbook:Dashi|dashi]]
* 2 Tbs. [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]
* 1½ Tbs. [[Cookbook:Mirin|mirin]]

;Condiments:
* [[Cookbook:Green onion|green onion]]s, thinly sliced
* Grated [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
* Grated [[Cookbook:Daikon|daikon]] (white radish)

==Procedure==


# Cut the soft tofu into rectangular pieces about 1&quot; thick.
# Arrange the layers on paper towels and leave for 10-15 minutes to drain.  Change the paper and turn over the slices.
# Mix sauce ingredients, heat in a pan until boiling.
# Sprinkle cornstarch on a plate.   Arrange the tofu slices on it.  Sprinkle more cornstarch over the tofu.   A powdered sugar shaker does a good job here.
# Heat the oil to 355°F (180°C) for deep frying.
# Pat any excess cornstarch off the tofu slices and slide them into the hot oil, one by one.  Don't add too many slices at once, because tofu lowers the oil temperature.  Fry until golden, turning once.
# Remove and drain on paper towels.
# Arrange in a compote-type dish, pour the sauce.  Top with a mound of grated daikon, a bit of grated ginger, and sliced green onions.

'''Portobello mushrooms''' are large mushrooms that can be prepared as a vegetarian entrée.  They can substitute for [[Cookbook:hamburger|hamburger]] patties, or be eaten alone.

==Ingredients==
* One large [[Cookbook:Mushroom|Portobello mushroom]] per person
* [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|Olive oil]]

==Simple Grilling Preparation==
* Remove stems from the mushrooms, wash and dry.
* Brush with olive oil.
* [[Cookbook:Grilling|Grill]] for about 10 minutes, alternating sides, until both sides are grill-marked.

* When cooking on a barbecue mixing the oil with a water based liquid (e.g. balsamic vinegar) will cause the fire to flare more and give the food more flavour, baste them as they cook.  Adding other flavours such as garlic and chilli works well. If you are in a hurry, just use vinaigrette dressing.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian Cuisine]] | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|US Cuisine]]

'''Chicken Parmigiana''' is a popular [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian]]-[[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|American]] dish served in a variety of ways.  The same basic recipe works for a number of dishes.  The components usually consists of a breaded, tenderized piece of [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]] (or slice of [[Cookbook:Eggplant|eggplant]]), a simple [[Cookbook:Marinara Sauce|marinara sauce]], and [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]] (usually [[Cookbook:Mozzarella Cheese|mozzarella]]).  A thicker [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]], such as linguini, a toasted loaf of Italian [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]], and a light red wine such as Chianti compliment this dish well.

This recipe is typical of the parmigiana recipes from New York and New Jersey.

==Ingredients==
* 2 [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] breasts
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] powder
* 1/2 a teaspoon of dried [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]]
* 1/4 teaspoon of dried [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]]
* 1/4 teaspoon of finely crushed [[Cookbook:Black Pepper|black pepper]]
* 1/2 a [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] of All-Purpose [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1/2 a cup of [[Cookbook:Tomato Puree|tomato puree]]
* 1/4 cup of [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] [[Cookbook:Stock|stock]]
* 1/2 a cup of [[Cookbook:Canola Oil|canola oil]] (see below if you wish to use [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]])
* 1/2 a cup of shredded [[Cookbook:Mozzarella Cheese|mozzarella cheese]]
* 1/4 a cup of grated [[Cookbook:Parmigiana Cheese|parmigiana cheese]]

==Preparation==
#In a heavy [[Cookbook:Skillet|skillet]] (preferrably cast iron), heat the oil on medium heat.
#While the oil is heating, use a [[Cookbook:Tenderizing Mallet|tenderizing mallet]] (or the ball of your hand) to pound the chicken breasts to about 1/2 an [[Cookbook:Inch|inch]] of thickness.  This step is important to ensure the chicken is tender and more importantly to ensure the chicken cooks thoroughly.
# Season the chicken breasts with salt and garlic powder.
# [[Cookbook:Dredging|Dredge]] the breasts in flour and shake off any excess.
# Place both breasts in the heated oil for 3 minutes, then flip and [[Cookbook:Frying|fry]] for an additional 2 minutes.
# Remove the breasts and place on a rack or paper towel.
# Turn on an [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]], set for [[Cookbook:Broiling|broiling]].
# In a large oven-safe [[Cookbook:Saucepan|sauce pan]], heat the tomato puree and chicken stock until it begins to [[Cookbook:Simmer|simmer]].
# Add the oregano, basil, and pepper to sauce pan and mix
# Place cooked chicken breasts in pan and flip a number of times to coat with sauce.
# Add mozzarella and parmigiana cheese to the tops of the breasts.
# Place in oven for 30-60 seconds.  It will burn very quickly so check it frequently.
# Remove from oven and serve.

==Tips==
* Use thin-sliced chicken cutlets (available at most supermarkets) to avoid the BIG mess and time of pounding.
* If pasta is to be served with this meal, it should be timed so that the parmigiana is done right when the pasta is.  The pasta should be removed directly from the pot and placed into the pan.  The remaining sauce can then be used with the pasta.
* This recipe works best with breasts that come from slightly older chickens (such as broiler or fryer chickens).  These chickens have a stronger taste but are generally tougher.  The tenderizing step takes care of the toughness of the older birds though.
* If you do not live in area where fresh tomatoes are grown, canned tomatoes are usually superior to the low-cost ones you will find in the super market.
* Tomato puree goes bad very quickly (even in the fridge).  Freezing the tomato puree in chunks allows for long-term storage.

==Variations and Varieties==
* For [[Cookbook:Veal|veal]] parmigiana, follow the same steps except do not tenderize.  Veal is already tender enough.  The veal can also be cooked for 2 minutes on each side.
* Omit the tenderizing step for [[Cookbook:Eggplant|eggplant]] parmigiana.
* If you want to use fresh garlic instead of powder, add it to the sauce instead of adding it to the chicken breast.
* You can also try using other types of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian]] [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheeses]] such as [[Cookbook:Provolone Cheese|provolone cheese]] or [[Cookbook:Fortina Cheese|fortina cheese]] to add more of a &quot;tasty kick&quot; compared to a mild cheese like mozzarella 
* You may wish to use [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]. When frying with olive oil, be sure to use a cheap solvent-extracted grade! The fancy grades can not tolerate heat. They have [[Cookbook:Smoke Point|smoke points]] as low as 200°F (93°C), making for both a fire hazard and a source of cancer-causing fumes. Save the cold-pressed extra-virgin olive oil for a [[Cookbook:Salad|salad]].

[[Image:Fishandchips.jpg|frame|right|Fish and chips]]
'''Fish and chips''' is a popular dish in Britain, New Zealand and Australia. The traditional [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]] in Britain is cod, though this is likely to fall apart or fail to cook in the middle.

==Ingredients==
*[[Cookbook:Fried Fish|Fried fish]] (crumbed or battered)
*[[Cookbook:Chips|Chips]] (&quot;french fries&quot;)
Although cod is widely used today, spiny dogfish is the fish originally used in this recipe. A member of the shark family, its flesh is firmer and the fillets are thinner leading to a quicker cooking time which was important to street vendors years ago. Also it lends itself to the malt vinegar in a way cod does not.  Dogfish was orginally used because it was considered a 'junk' fish and was cheap. If you wish to savour this dish as it was meant to be cooked, seek out vendors who use the traditional spiny dogfish.

==Procedure==
#Place the fried fish and chips on brown paper or newsprint.
#Top with [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and/or [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]].
#Serve with [[Cookbook:Pickles|pickles]], pickled [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], pickled [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]], and [[Cookbook:Mushy Peas|mushy peas]]. (Britain)

Sponge cake is the most commonly recognised variety of [[Cookbook:Baking|baked]] confectionery in Britain. It has a sweet taste, often flavoured with [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]], [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]] or other additions. It can be cut and displayed in a very large number of different ways.

A [[Cookbook:Impossible Sponge Cake|more difficult version of this recipe]] is available
for those having a kitchen scale and wanting to use it.

==Ingredients==
===For the cake===
* 2 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|c]] minus 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|T]] Self-Rising [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1/2 c [[Cookbook:Superfine Sugar|superfine sugar]]
* 1/2 c [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* 2 mounded [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|T]] [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]] (unused, but you supposedly need it)

If your eggs seem kind of big, you might want to increase the amounts of some ingredients. Add an extra teaspoon each of sugar and butter, and two extra teaspoons of flour. Also, note the adjustments below based on usage of optional ingredients.

====Extras (Optional)====
* [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] extract (1-2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|t]])
* food coloring (according to looks)
* [[Cookbook:Cocoa Powder|cocoa powder]] (according to taste. Use 3 parts less flour for every 4 parts added.)
===For the filling===
Choose one of these to spread between two cakes if making a cake with more than two eggs.
* 2 to 4 T jelly (softened with pallette knife or similar) or
* buttercream (cream together 1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|c]] superfine sugar and 1/2 c butter)
===For dredging===
* 1/3 cup sugar, any type

==Method==
#Preheat an oven to [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|400°F]].
#Cream together the sugar and butter in the mixing bowl. They should achieve a creamy texture with quite a thick consistency. The longer, harder and faster the butter and sugar are creamed the lighter the cake will be when cooked.
#Add both eggs and mix well.
#Add all the flour and mix well.
#Add any food coloring, flavoring etc. at this point. If you add liquid ingredients, add the same volume again of sugar-and-flour mix to compensate. If adding dry ingredients, ensure to use 3 parts less flour for every 4 parts of extra ingredient added.
#Beat with wooden spoon in a circular motion, trying to incorporate as much air as possible.
#Grease one or two cake pan(s) with butter. You may wish to use a [[Cookbook:Springform Pan|springform pan]] for this recipe.
#Spoon, then scrape, as much cake mixture as possible into the pan(s). If using two pans, try to ensure that both tins have an equal amount of cake mixture in them and that both are not more than 3/4 filled.
#Put the cake tins into the oven and leave them for approximately 10 minutes before checking them. The cooking time should eventually reach around 15 minutes: keep checking them regularly after about 8 minutes since ovens vary.
#Turn the cake out onto a wire rack to cool.
#If doing two layers, turn one of them upside down and spread your filling onto its base, then stick the other cake (top up) onto the upside-down cake.
#Dredge the cake with sugar using a spoon.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine_of_Italy|Cuisine of Italy]] | [[Cookbook:Vegetarian_cuisine|Vegetarian cuisine]]

This article describes general preparation procedures for the popular Italian appetizer (or ''antipasto'') '''Bruschetta'''. It is a dish coming from the Southern Italy culinary tradition. It is commonly mispronounced in America as &quot;bru-shetta&quot;, but should be pronounced with a hard K sound, &quot;bru-sketta.&quot;

There are many types of ''bruschetta'', mainly involving special roasted and/or hard bread which may require particular preparation to be served.

This type of ''bruschetta'' is a meeting point between Northern and Southern Italy: it requires Tuscan (''Toscano'') [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]], a kind of saltless bread originating in Tuscania, Italy, usually coming in blocks.

You can adapt this recipe to as many servings as you need. As a guideline, you can serve 1 or 2 ''bruschette'' per person.



==Ingredients==
* Tuscan [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]
* fresh [[Cookbook:Mozzarella Cheese|mozzarella cheese]] (optional)
* [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]] or [[Cookbook:Tomato_Sauce|tomato sauce]] (a non-traditional addition)
* [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]]
* [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]]
* [[Cookbook:Black_Pepper|black pepper]]
* [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

==Procedure==
# Pre-heat the oven at 200°C
# Slice out a few 1cm-thick slices from the Tuscan bread (1 or 2 per person)
# Put the Tuscan slices in the oven, until they become gold-looking (this takes a few minutes)
#* In the meantime, you can prepare the tomatoes, if you're going to use these instead of the tomato sauce; there are two alternatives: you can slice them finely (3mm-thick circa), or grossly (1cm-thick circa). If you slice them grossly, you can then cut them down into small cubes
# Take the bread slices from the oven and rub them front and back with a slice of garlic, until they acquire an intense smell; then put the slices on a dish
# Lay the cheese and fine tomato slices, cubes, or a thin layer of tomato sauce, on the upper side of the bread
# Add a little oil, oregano, salt, black pepper and 2 or 3 leaves of basil
# Serve hot.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Austria|Austrian Cuisine]]

The [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Austria|Austrian]] version of the Goulash [[Cookbook:Soup|soup]] is an easy to prepare, inexpensive, tasty and filling
dish well suited for cold winter days. This thick, sweet-spicy soup of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Hungary|Hungarian]] origin is served in inns and restaurants across Austria. 

The key ingredient for goulash soup is a good quantity of sweet [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]] powder. 
It is important not to use hot paprika, the red powder sold simply as &quot;paprika&quot; in most supermarkets, as this
would make the soup too spicy and of the wrong consistency. 
Sweet paprika can be obtained from [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Poland|Polish]] or central [[Cookbook:European cuisines|European]] delis and specialist supermarkets. It is normally sold in 250 [[Cookbook:g|g]] sachets.  
For the authentic taste, the [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]], [[Cookbook:Caraway|caraway seeds]] and [[Cookbook:Marjoram|marjoram]] are indispensable. [[Cookbook:Thyme|Thyme]] and tomato puree can be
left out if unavailable. 

==Ingredients==
 
* 500 [[Cookbook:g|g]] lean [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]
* 2 large [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]]
* 2 large [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], peeled
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbsp]] vegetable [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]
* 3 tbsp powdered ''sweet [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]]'' 
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] powdered ''hot paprika''
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Caraway|caraway seeds]] (''not'' cumin)
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]] (fresh or dried)
* 1 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaf]]
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Marjoram|marjoram]] (fresh or dried)
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]] [[Cookbook:Puree|puree]]
* 50 [[Cookbook:ml|ml]] white [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:l|l]] [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] [[Cookbook:Stock|stock]] or 2 stock cubes dissolved in 1 l of water. 
* [[Cookbook:Black Pepper|black pepper]]

==Procedure==

#Cut the beef and potatoes into 1.5 [[Cookbook:cm|cm]] cubes. Cut the caraway seeds into rough chunks with a kitchen knife. Chop onions into thin slices. Warm the beef stock.
#Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a cooking pan to medium/high heat. [[Cookbook:Fry|Fry]] the beef cubes until medium brown and crispy, remove and drain on a kitchen towel.
#Turn to medium heat. Add another tbsp of vegetable oil and roast the caraway seeds for 1 min. Add the onions and turn to low heat. Gently roast the onions until they turn yellowish. 
#Add the beef cubes and roast for another 2 min. Slowly add the vinegar, beef stock, potatoes and tomato puree. Add the sweet paprika and stir well to disperse clumps.
#Season with marjoram, thyme, hot paprika, the bay leaf and a pinch of black pepper. [[Cookbook:Simmering|Simmer]] for 30 min.

==Variations==

#Garnish each dish with with a tbsp of [[Cookbook:Sour Cream|sour cream]] or ''[[Cookbook:Creme Fraiche|creme fraiche]]'' and sprinkle with freshly cut [[Cookbook:Chive|chives]] before serving.
#Add 100 ml of [[Cookbook:Red Wine|red wine]]  after frying beef/onions.
#For a more nutritious meal, fry 2 [[Cookbook:Green Pepper|green peppers]], 3 [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], 1 [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]] and 1 [[Cookbook:Leek|leek]] (all chopped) with the onions.

'''Jambalaya''' is a simple dish that works well as an everyday meal. This one uses [[Cookbook:Meat_and_poultry#Poultry|poultry]], [[Cookbook:Tomato|canned tomatoes]], and [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]]. It is not spicy hot at all, but has a strong herbal flavor.

==Ingredients==

* 1/3 cup chopped [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]]
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* 2/3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] long grain [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]]

* 1/2 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 teaspoon dried [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]]
* 1.5 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]]
* 1 drained small can of sliced [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]] (optional)

==Procedure==

#Prepare the canned tomatoes: tear them up, remove the stem ends, remove the seeds, etc. '''Keep the juice.'''
#Select a wide pan with a lid.
#Lightly [[Cookbook:Frying|fry]] the celery in the butter. Soften the celery, but do not brown it.
#Add everything to the pan. (you can add the basil, meat and mushrooms later if you prefer)
#Bring to a [[Cookbook:Boiling|boil]], then cover and [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]] for about 20 minutes. The liquid should get absorbed into the rice.
#Discard the bay leaf.

==Variations==
*[[Image:Jambalaya.JPG|thumb|right|Jambalaya with sausage.]] Include [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausage]], cut into 1/2-[[Cookbook:Inch|inch]] slices, in the frying celery, omitting some of the butter and salt if desired.
*Use a can of diced tomatoes with [[Cookbook:Jalapeño|jalapeños]] for extra spice and less prep. work.

'''New Mexico Pork Tamales''' are a classic Southwestern United States meal, made from pork and chicken.  This version adds cumin, chili powder and garlic powder to outer masa flour of the tamale.

==Ingredients==
===Meat filling===
*1 cup shredded cooked [[Cookbook:Pork|pork ]]
*1 cup shredded cooked [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken ]]
*1 (15 ounce - ~400g) can beanless chili con carne
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Oil and fat|cooking oil]]
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|chili powder]]
*1 tablespoon garlic powder 
*2 teaspoons ground [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]]
*1/4 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 

===Wrappers===
*1 (8 ounce - 230g) package of corn husks (contains about 100 husks)

===Masa mixture===
*2 pounds (900g) [[Cookbook:Corn Masa|Masa flour]]
*3 tablespoons [[Cookbook:paprika|paprika]]
*3 tablespoons chili powder
*3 tablespoons garlic powder
*1 tablespoon ground cumin
*2 tablespoons salt
*2 cups solid vegetable shortening
*8 cups warm [[Cookbook:Chicken_Stock#Chicken|chicken stock]] (or 8 cups water and 8 chicken bullion cubes)

==Procedure==
===Meat filling===
#Stir ingredients together and refrigerate until needed.

===Wrappers===
#Soak corn husks in warm water for at least two hours. A dinner plate may have to be used to hold corn husks under water.

===Masa mixture===
#Mix dry Masa flour with paprika, chili powder, garlic powder, cumin and salt. Mix well for even distribution of spices.
#Cut shortening into the Masa mixture with a pastry cutter. Mix until mixture resembles the texture of tiny peas.
#Slowly add chicken broth one cup at a time. Mix well with electric mixer. Mixture should resemble consistency of peanut butter.
#Continue mixing with electric mixer to incorporate air into batter. Mixture is ready to use when 1 teaspoon of batter floats on water.

===Filling and cooking tamales===
#Use one corn husk per tamale. Lay flat on table. The corn husk is roughly rectangle shaped.
#Spread 1/2 cup of Masa mixture on entire upward facing corn husk, leaving a 1 inch (2.5cm) gap along the long edge and narrow end of the corn husk. 
#Spread 1 tablespoon of meat mixture, in a narrow band in the middle, down the length of the masa spread corn husk.
#Roll/fold the husk along the wide edge, touching the edges of the masa together, with the meat mixture ending up in the middle of the masa. The part of the husk with the 1 inch gap with no masa should be rolled around the outside of the husk.
#Fold about 1 inch of end of rolled husk, upward along the body of the husk. (The narrow end with 1 inch masa gap). You should end up with something resembling a cornucopia, with one end folded over and one end open.
#Stand all of the rolled tamales on end in a steaming colander with the open end of the tamale facing upward.
#Steam the tamales over boiling water for 2 hours. Place a lid over the steaming colander. Keep the tamales above the boiling water, don't allow them to stand in it.
#At the end of the cooking period, open one tamale and make sure the masa is cooked and not doughy.
#Allow tamales to rest 30 minutes after cooking, before serving. This will help to keep the masa from sticking to the corn husk.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Makes about 50 to 75 tamales.
*Left over tamales may be frozen in zip lock bags.
*Reheat frozen tamales in a microwave. If you reheat by steaming, they may become soggy.

#Mix soy milk into the dry ingredients.
#Heat a griddle until water sprinkled on it quickly evaporates. Spread a thin film of oil on the griddle.
#Pour pancake batter on griddle to form 4- to 5-inch circles. Bubbles should start forming.
#When the underside is light brown, flip the pancake.
#When the other side is light brown, serve.

==Variations==
*Banana pancakes: add one well mashed banana to the batter.
*Chocolate pancakes: add 1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] chocolate chips to the batter.
*Walnut pancakes: add 1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] roughly chopped walnuts to the batter.
*Cranberry pancakes: add 1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] dried cranberries to the batter.

Any of the above ingredients can be mixed together.

==Notes==
* Don't overmix! Overmixing will produce gluten; this will inhibit rising and make the pancakes rubbery.
* Optionally, you can serve your pancakes with syrup or jam.
* Substituting rice milk for soy milk may make the pancakes fall apart more easily.

[[Image:ToastedWhiteBread.jpg|right|180px|thumb|American Toast.]]

'''Toast''' generally consists of [[Cookbook:Toasting|toasted]] [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] with a topping.

Toast often goes well with [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]], especially with [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]] or [[Cookbook:Jam|jam]] as the topping. Toast generally goes well with [[Cookbook:Breakfast|breakfast]] foods, particularly [[Cookbook:Eggs|eggs]] and either [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]] or [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausage]]. In this case one might prefer to have [[Cookbook:Orange Juice|orange juice]] with toast.

A particularly good combination of toppings is [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] with [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]] and [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] sprinkled on top. The butter should be well-spread and well-melted first, so that the cinnamon and sugar will stick to the toast. Try using about 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] of sugar and &amp;frac14; [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] of cinnamon for each slice of bread.

Butter would be the best topping choice when using [[Cookbook:Raisin Bread|raisin bread]] to make toast.

==Ingredients==
*one or more slices of [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]], sized to fit your [[Cookbook:Toaster|toaster]]
*topping (optional)

==Toppings==
*[[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*[[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*[[Cookbook:Honey|honey]]
*[[Cookbook:Jam|jam]]
*[[Cookbook:Jelly|jelly]]
*[[Cookbook:Lard|lard]]
*[[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
*[[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]

==Procedure==
#Ensure that the [[Cookook:toaster|toaster]] is plugged in, generally clean, and functional.
#Place some bread slices into the toaster. Usually, you must place each slice into a separate slot. Some toasters can hold two slices in an extra-wide slot. If you use a [[Cookbook:Toaster Oven|toaster oven]], you may need to lay the bread slices flat on a metal grill inside the toaster oven.
#If the toaster has a darkness control, adjust it as desired.
#Activate the toaster.
#Watch the bread turn into toast. If it starts to get excessively dark, carefully remove the toast. If you are unable to make the toast pop out, unplug the toaster. Do not reach into a slotted toaster, whether with your hand or a metal tool, while it is plugged in or very hot.
#Spread your choice of topping on the toast with a [[Cookbook:Knife|knife]], [[Cookbook:Spatula|spatula]], or [[Cookbook:Spoon|spoon]].

==Variations==
*The bread crust can be cut off after the toast has been cooked. The topping can be added to both sides.
*Replace bread slices with a [[Cookbook:Bagel|bagel]] or [[Cookbook:English Muffin|English muffin]] cut across the axis. 
*Replace each slice of bread with a [[Cookbook:Waffle|waffle]] or [[Cookbook:Scone|scone]].

'''Cranberry sauce''' is a [[Cookbook:Jelly|jelly]] or a [[Cookbook:Jam|jam]] made by cooking cranberries, sugar, and often other ingredients together. Many, if not most, Americans are more familiar with the canned cranberry sauce which is a clear, solidified, jelly that is often valued for the property of maintaining the shape of the can in which it is packaged.

The fruit will generally come apart when vigorously [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiled]], so there is no need to crush or puree it when a jam-style cranberry sauce is desired. Cranberry sauce can be made from cranberries and sugar alone.

In blender, blend cumin seed powder with yoghurt, milk, lemon juice, salt and ice cubes. Optionally scatter with crumbled mint, and a small pinch of cayenne if for piquancy. Serve chilled. (4 servings)

==Sweet (''mithi'') lassi==

* ¼ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] ground [[Cookbook:Cardamom|cardamom]]

Combine all ingredients except ice in [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]] and blend until smooth. Then add ice and continue blending until frothy.

==Sweet mango lassi==

[[Image:Karjalanpiirakka-20060227.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Karjalanpiirakka, made by Leipomo Eho (a bakery in Helsinki)]]

'''Karelian pasties''' (''Karjalanpiirakat'' in Finnish) are traditional pasties from North Karelia, Finland. Today they are eaten throughout Finland. According to the traditional recipe the pasties are made from a thin rye crust with a filling of rice. Butter, often mixed with boiled egg (''munavoi''), is spread over the hot pasties before eating.

There are also versions with carrot or potato filling.

== Ingredients ==
=== Filling ===
* 0,5 litre of [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* 3 dl [[Cookbook:Porridge|porridge]] [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]]
* 9 dl [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 1,5 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

=== Crust ===
* 2 dl cold water
* 1,5 tsp salt
* 3,5 dl rye [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1,5 dl [[Cookbook:Wheat|wheat]] flour

=== Moistening ===
* 1 dl milk
* 50 [[Cookbook:g|g]] [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]

=== Egg-butter spread (munavoi) ===
* 2 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* 50 g butter
* 0,25 tsp salt (optional)
* 0,5 cans, 125 g, [[Cookbook:Cottage cheese|cottage cheese]] (optional)

== Procedure ==
=== Filling ===
# Mix the rice into boiling water reserved for the filling. Boil until the water has saturated the rice.
# Add the milk and stir the filling for a few minutes. Reduce heat and agitate the porridge. The cooking time is about 40 minutes. Stir the porridge every now and then.
# When the porridge is ready, it will seem thickish. Then add the salt. Cool the porridge.

=== Crust ===
# Mix the flours and salt into the cold water.
# Make the dough smooth and pliable by moulding it by hands on a panification support.
# Shape the dough into a smooth bar and divide it into about twenty pieces.
# Roll the pieces into balls, flatten them into small cakes and cover them with plastic.
# Roll the cakes into thin sheets that have approximately 17 cm in diameter.

=== Baking the pasties ===
# Lay porridge on each cake so that the porridge reaches the ends.
# Pinch the edges together with your fingers.
#

=== Finishing ===
# Moisten the pasties from both sides with boiling hot mixture of milk and butter.
# Lay the pasties on each other and brew them under a towel and bacon paper.
# Mix the ''munavoi'' ingredients (boil the eggs for 12 minutes) and use it as butter on the pasties.

'''Honey Taffy''' – This recipe entails a good workout with the reward of unmistakably honey-flavored candies. This recipe can be completed by a single chef, but is much more fun with the help of friends and family.

==Ingredients==

*2 cups [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1/2 tsp [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:CornStarch|cornstarch]]
*1 cup liquid [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]], any variety
*3/4 cup [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]

==Procedure==

#In a 3 or 4 quart heavy-bottomed [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]] combine the sugar, salt and cornstarch until uniform.
#Using a wooden or metal spoon, stir in the honey and the water. Place the saucepan over medium-high heat and continually stir until all the sugar dissolves.
#Continue to stir the mixture until the mixture begins to boil. Once boiling begins, let the solution cook undisturbed until it reaches 270&amp;deg;F also known as the [[Cookbook:Cold Water Candy Test#Soft Crack|soft crack stage]]. Add the butter.
#Remove the hot mixture from heat and pour onto a greased, lipped cookie sheet, a greased marble slab, or a silicone mat, such as a [[Cookbook:Silpat|Silpat]].
#When taffy is cool enough to handle with greased cleaned hands, gather the taffy and continually stretch, fold and recombine it until it lightens in color and gains a satiny gloss. This step is best accomplished with a friend. This step requires 10 to 15 minutes of constant pulling.
#Once taffy has been properly pulled, roll into 1/2 inch (ropes and cut into 1 inch long pieces with a knife or greased scissors. Once all the taffy is cut, wrap in small squares of waxed paper and twist the ends.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Be extremely careful around the boiling solution, as it gets extremely hot and sticks like tar.
*Use a wooden or metal spoon for this recipe, as most plastic spoons will melt or deform.  A wooden spoon is best because a metal spoon will get very hot in the sugar syrup.
*You can add extra flavoring or coloring to the taffy if you mix it in at the same time as the butter.
*If you don’t like honey, or don’t want to use a lot of it, you can substitute [[Cookbook:Corn Syrup|corn syrup]] for equal parts of the missing honey.
*If you want some extra reward for extra effort, try making two batches with different colors and/or flavors at once, and twisting or braiding the taffy ropes before cutting to make interesting combinations.
*If you don't have cornstarch, you can use 1 tsp. of vinegar instead to help prevent recrystallization.

A pleasantly-suprising recipe encountered in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|China]]. Also, a good first attempt for beginning deep-fryers. Makes a good substitute to chips or [[Cookbook:French Fries|fries]].

==Ingredients==

* canned or frozen [[Cookbook:Corn|corn]]
* [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* [[Cookbook:Egg Wash|egg wash]]  (optional)
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]

==Procedure==

# If using frozen corn, thaw. If using canned corn, microwave in a glass bowl or gently heat on the stove until warm.
# Coat corn with a light layer of [[Cookbook:Egg Wash|egg wash]].
# Mix salt and pepper into the flour, [[Cookbook:MSG|MSG]] or other [[Cookbook:Spice|spices]] optional.
# Move corn from the egg wash and cover with flour.
# Heat oil to moderate to high heat.
# Deep-fry floured corn until golden brown on the outside (less than two minutes).
# Serve as a complement to another dish

==Warning==
When a pot of hot oil catches fire, the flames will reach up for 2 or 3 feet. If you must work under flammable cabinets or shelves, be sure to have a fire extinguisher handy. An oil with a high [[Cookbook:Smoke Point|smoke point]] is less likely to cause problems, including indoor air pollution and fire. See [[Cookbook:Deep Fat Fry|Deep-frying]] for more warnings.

==Variation==
Substitute moderately-chopped [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]] such as [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]] and [[Cookbook:Green Bean|green beans]] for additional flavors.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|French cuisine]]

'''Bouillabaisse''' is a traditional Provençal [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]] [[Cookbook:Stew|stew]] originating from the port city of Marseille. 

It is usually a simple fish stock containing different kinds of cooked fish and [[Cookbook:shellfish|shellfish]]. This is complemented with a variety of [[Cookbook:Spices and herbs|herbs and spices]] such as [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], [[Cookbook:Chili peppers|chillies]], [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaves]], [[Cookbook:Fennel|fennel]] and [[Cookbook:Saffron|saffron]]. Vegetables such as [[Cookbook:Leek|leeks]], [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]] and [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]] are boiled together to produce a rich flavour. The exact proportions vary by cook and region.

The [http://www.toquentete.net/deran_charte_de_la_bouillabaisse.php Charte de la Bouillabaisse Marseillaise] was signed in 1980 by 11 restaurants in an attempt to standardize the definition of  a bouillabaisse. According to the charter, a bouillabaisse must be prepared with at least four of the following fish: [[Cookbook:Monkfish|monkfish]], [[Cookbook:John Dory|John Dory]], [[Cookbook:Galinette|galinette]] (or [[Cookbook:Gunard|gunard]]), [[Cookbook:Mullett|mullett]], [[Cookbook:Rascasse|rascasse]], [[Cookbook:Conger eel|conger eel]], and [[Cookbook:chapon|chapon]] ([[Cookbook:Rascasse rouge|rascasse rouge]]). Most versions will contain at least rascasse and chapon. 

Bouillabaisse is often only served when there are large groups of people, as it is time-consuming to prepare and its ingredients are expensive. The stew and the fish are usually served in separate bowls, with the stew poured over slices of French bread seasoned with a spicy garlic mayonnaise called [[Cookbook:Rouille|rouille]].

==For a typical soup base==
===Ingredients===
*1/4 cup extra virgin [[Cookbook:olive oil|olive oil]]
*2 large [[Cookbook:onion|onion]]s, small dice
*2 [[Cookbook:leek|leek]]s (white portion), washed thoroughly and sliced
*4 cloves [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic]], crushed
*3 pounds [[Cookbook:sculpin|sculpin]], dressed and cut into 1- to 2-inch pieces
*8 small [[Cookbook:plum tomato|plum tomato]]es, skinned, seeded, and quartered
*[[Cookbook:Zest|zest]] of 1 [[Cookbook:orange|orange]]
*1 stalk [[Cookbook:celery|celery]], small dice
*2 tsp fresh [[Cookbook:thyme|thyme]] (or 1 tsp dried)
*3 [[Cookbook:bay leaves|bay leaves]], whole
*1/2 teaspoon [[Cookbook:red chili flake|red chili flake]]
*4 medium [[Cookbook:fennel|fennel]] bulbs, cleaned and quartered
*4 quarts boiling [[Cookbook:water|water]]
*[[Cookbook:salt|salt]] as [[Cookbook:pepper|pepper]] as needed for seasoning adjustment

===Method===
# In a large, heavy [[Cookbook:stockpot|stockpot]], heat the olive oil over medium heat. Sweat the onion and leeks with a bit of salt (stirring often and making sure not to brown them) for about 10 minutes. Add garlic and continue to sweat, stirring often until onions and leeks have lost their main texture - approximately 15 min.
# Increase to high-heat and add the fish.  Stir vigorously until the fish falls apart and dissolves into the onion, leek, and garlic mash - approximately 10 min.
# Add all other ingredients - except water - and continue to cook over medium heat for approximately 10-min.  Make sure to stir often to prevent scorching. 
# Pour in the boiling water, lower the heat to a medium [[Cookbook:simmer|simmer]], and cook for 20- to 30-min.
# Process the entire product through a [[Cookbook:food mill|food mill]] or [[Cookbook:chinois|chinois]], ensuring to puree the mixture into a fine, homogenous soup base.
# Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Do not add additional salt during the cooking process as some water will evaporate during the simmer and you could possibly over-salt the base.

The soup base can be used immediately or cooled (in a cold-water bath in a large sink) and refrigerated for up to two days.

==For the completed soup==

===Ingredients===
*6-7 pounds of assorted [[Cookbook:fish|fish]] (with bones) or 5-6 pounds of dressed fish fillets. Choose from any of the fish described in the 1980 charter.
*1/2 cup [[Cookbook:olive oil|olive oil]]
*2 medium [[Cookbook:fennel|fennel]] bulbs, sliced thinly
*1 tsp [[Cookbook:saffron|saffron]] threads, bloomed in 1/2 cup boiling water
*1 recipe of the bouillabaisse stock
*1 [[Cookbook:baguette|baguette]], sliced into rounds
*2 lbs Yukon gold [[Cookbook:potato|potato]]es (or other firm boiling potato) peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
*ground [[Cookbook:cayenne pepper|cayenne pepper]] to taste
*1 recipe [[cookook:rouille|rouille]]
*2 cloves [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic]], halved
*20 to 30 cooked [[Cookbook:mussels|mussels]]
*fresh [[Cookbook:thyme|thyme]] leaves

===Method===
# Cut the fish into equal pieces, approximately 2- to 3-inch pieces.
# [[Cookbook:Marinate|Marinate]] all the fish pieces and fennel in a large [[Cookbook:mixing bowl|mixing bowl]] with 1/2 of the bloomed saffron and water and oil. Cover and place in a refrigerator for at least 2 hours but not more then 6.
# Bring the soup base to a rapid [[Cookbook:boil|boil]] and add the remainder of the saffron.
# [[Cookbook:Toast|Toast]] the bread slices until just browned in a [[Cookbook:toaster|toaster]], [[Cookbook:toaster oven|toaster oven]], or an [[Cookbook:oven|oven]] set on low-heat. Rub with the halved garlic cloves and set aside.
# Add the fish and potatoes to the boiling stock and cook until the potatoes are easily pierced with a fork.  Adjust seasoning with salt, pepper, and cayenne. 
# Remove the fish and potatoes from the stock and place in a large dish.  Put a slice of bread in the bottom of a bowl and ladle the soup base over it.  Sprinkle thyme over the fish and potatoes.  Serve separately.

'''Hermits''' are chewy [[Cookbook:Molasses|molasses]] [[Cookbook:Spices and herbs|spice]] [[Cookbook:Cookie|cookies]]. This version is on the strong side of the spectrum so those who prefer less hot-tasting food should hold back on the cloves and ginger.

==Ingredients==

*2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] (AP)
*⅔ cup seedless [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]] (a handful more if you like them)
*⅔ cup dark [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]], packed
*2½ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] ground [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
*2 teaspoon ground [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*1 teaspoon ground [[Cookbook:Clove|cloves]]
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
*½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*½ cup molasses 
*6 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], melted
*2 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] extract
*1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]

==Procedure==

#Preheat oven to [[Cookbook:Oven temperatures|375°F/190°C]] (yes, first thing).
#Line a sheet pan with parchment paper (a buttered sheet pan works as well but makes cooling and cutting more difficult and more damaging to the sheet pan).
#In a large bowl, stir together flour, raisins, brown sugar, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, baking powder, and salt until well combined; watch the brown sugar to ensure that it doesn't clump, it will want to do so and brown sugar clumps coated in flour look a lot like raisins coated in flour.
#Stir in molasses, butter, vanilla, and egg until fully integrated. Spread the batter in two strips (approximately 6&quot; by 3&quot;) separated by at least 1½&quot; on the sheet pan.
#Bake for 12 – 15 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the strips comes out dry.
#Allow to cool slightly then remove the hermits (on their parchment) to cooling racks to cool completely; be sure the bottoms have cooled (just reach under and feel -- if its more than a little warmer than room temperature its not there yet). 
#Move the hermits (still on their parchment) to a counter for portioning and removal from parchment. Cut hermits into 1½ [[Cookbook:Inch|inch]] wide strips (a [[Cookbook:Pizza Cutter|pizza cutter]] should work well) then carefully scrape them away from the parchment with a good thin [[Cookbook:Spatula|spatula]].
#Enjoy with a glass of [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] or [[Cookbook:A Nice Cup of Tea|a nice cup of tea]].

Although nice warm these hermits will be even better after a night in an air-tight tin. They should last about a week in that tin though at my house they've never lasted more than a day.

'''Wonton wrappers''' are thin [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]]-like wrappers used for wontons. They are suitable for [[Cookbook:Wonton Soup|wonton soup]]. Oversize (7&quot;&amp;nbsp;square) wrappers may be used as [[Cookbook:Egg Roll|egg roll]] wrappers. Round wrappers are best for making [[Cookbook:Potsticker|potstickers]].

Most people will prefer to buy wrappers ready-made. This is especially easy for wontons, because egg roll wrappers may be cut in quarters to make wonton wrappers. Look in a supermarket near the [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]] and Asian [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]].

For the stubbornly determined expert cook though, here you go:

==Ingredients==
*2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1/3-1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] water

==Procedure==
#Sift flour and salt into a large bowl; create a well-like indentation in the center.
#Beat egg lightly, pour into indentation in the flour and mix well.
#Sprinkle with cold water, wet your hands and knead the mixture into a smooth dough.
#Place dough in a bowl and cover with a damp cloth, refrigerate for 30 minutes to an hour.
#Sprinkle a wide work area or board with flour. Roll out the dough until it is paper thin and its edges are even in thickness. The wonton skins will be partially transparent.
#Cut dough in 2 to 3 inch strips, flour lightly then stack one on top of the other and cut the strips into 2 to 3 inch squares.
#Place skins on tray and cover with a damp cloth until ready to use.

==Recipes using wonton wrappers include==

*[[Cookbook:Wonton Soup|Wonton Soup]]

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:North American cuisines|North American Cuisines]] | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Ontario|Cuisine of Ontario]]

'''Sweet Cornbread''' is a variant of the [[Cookbook:Skillet Cornbread | Skillet Cornbread]] made throughout the Southern United States.  Sweet Cornbread is common in central and eastern Ontario and Quebec and is sometimes known by the alternative name of Johnny Cake.  Its presence in these southern regions of Canada is thought to be due to the influx of British Loyalists from what is now the Southern states moving to the then-English-controlled colonies during the [[:w:American War of Independence | American War of Independence]].

== Ingredients ==

* 256 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]] (1 cup) of cornmeal
* 512 mL (2 cups) of flour
* 8 mL (1 1/2 teaspoons) of baking powder
* 128 mL (1/2 cup) of maple syrup
* 128 mL of brown sugar
* 128 mL of butter
* 5 mL (1 teaspoon) of salt
* 2 eggs

== Procedure ==

# In a large bowl beat eggs lightly to break the yolks as one would for scrambled eggs, then mix in the butter.  Soften the butter beforehand if you must by heating it a little.
# The butter/egg mixture should be loose. Add the sugar and maple syrup, mix well, then add the salt to the liquid mixture.
# Mix the cornmeal and baking powder, then blend them into the liquids.
# Slowly add the flour as needed to reach a proper cake batter texture. This should be softer than a cookie dough, able to stick to the mixing spool and come off in blobs.  You may not need all of the flour, or may even need a little more based on your eggs and how closely you measured.
# Pour into a greased pan and put into an oven heated to 200°C (400°F) and let bake for between 15-25 minutes.

== Notes, tips, and variations ==

* When mixing the batter, be sure it is soft enough for a typical cake; you do not want it too moist or dry.  Use milk to fill in liquid you need and a half-and-half mix of flour and cornmeal if you are too moist.

* Keep a close eye on the cake while it bakes: it will become hard fast if you do not take it out in time.

* If you want to make a crisper crust take a 3 part mix of equal amounts of flour, cornmeal and brown sugar, mix well.  Add to the top of the cake half way into the baking process, but do this very quickly: leaving the door open too long will make your cake a rock.  The amount required varies based on the pan you use, so use your eyes for what you need (less than a cup total).  Despite the call for opening it halfway through baking, adding it at the beginning should work fine as well.

* You can substitute honey for the maple syrup, or plain sugar. Maple is used for its flavouring as much as its sweetness.

* Margarine or vegetable oil will do as well as butter for this. Butter was used traditionally and is thus listed.

* This dish is usually made for after meals and outside them rather than with them, which is how its cousin [[Cookbook:Skillet Cornbread | Skillet Cornbread]] is used.  However, when having [[Cookbook:Maple Beans | Maple Beans]] and Ham, Sweet Cornbread is often served with it.

'''Grannie Gilbert's Sugar Cookies''' are a recipe of sugar cookies running with the Gilbert women of Ontario, Canada for more than 100 years.  No one knows where the recipe started, but it's been that way as long as any can recall with no real change.

==Ingredients==

* 2-3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] (250-375 [[Cookbook:Gram|g]]) of [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 2 teaspoons (10 g) of [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* 1 cup (200 g) of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1 cup (230 g) of [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]]/[[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* a pinch of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]]
* 3 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]

==Procedure==

# In a large bowl beat eggs lightly to break the yolks as one would for scrambled eggs, then mix in the shortening.  Soften the butter before hand if you must by heating it a little.
# The shortening/egg mixture should be loose, add the sugar, mix well then add the salt to the liquid mixture.
# Add the baking powder then slowly add the flour as needed to reach a proper doughy state, you may not need all of the flour, or may even need a little more based on your eggs and how closely you measured.
# Make balls and place onto a pan then into an oven heated to 175°C (350°F) and let bake for between 15-20 minutes.

==Notes, tips, and variations==

* Feel free to switch out half the sugar with another sweet item, like honey.
* Using three tablespoons of [[Cookbook:Cocoa Powder|cocoa powder]] one can get a slight chocolate flavour to the cookie, without being overtly chocolatey.
* Try adding chocolate chips to it.

'''Pork Tenderloin with Asparagus and Proscuitto'''

== Ingredients ==

* pork tenderloin (approx 1/2 lb)
* 1 lb [[Cookbook:Asparagus|asparagus]]
* 50g of [[Cookbook:Proscuitto|proscuitto]]
* 175ml [[Cookbook:Cream|whipping cream]] (35% [[Cookbook:Milkfat|milkfat]])
* 6-10 cloves garlic
* 3-4 [[Cookbook:Shallot|shallots]]
* 2 sundried tomatoes
* approximately 500g linguine
* 4 tbsp olive oil
* 100ml white wine

==Procedure ==

#Dice the shallots and garlic and set them aside. 
#Wash and slice the asparagus into small pieces, using angled cuts for improved presentation. 
#If you wish, you may include a few slices of proscuitto (chopped) to set aside as you may want to include it in the sauce.
#Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (200 C). 
#Place the pork on a clean cutting board. Wrap the tenderloin with the slices of proscuitto, trying to wrapp as tightly as possible so it will stay in place. 
#While you are doing this, also preheat an oven-safe pan to medium. Pour a few tablespoons of olive oil into the pan and place the pork inside. Start browning the meat on all sides. Once that is done, place the entire pan into the oven.
#While you are doing this, heat up another pan (preferably a [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]]) and pour a few tablespoons of olive oil into it. Once it's heated up, toss the garlic and shallots in and saute them lightly. 
#Once the garlic has been sauteed to a very light brown colour, add a small amount of olive oil and the asparagus. 
#When the asparagus is slightly sauteed, add about 1/2 of the cream and about 1/4 of the wine.
#Fill a medium-sized pot 3/4 full with salted water and set on high heat on a back burner.
#Turn the tenderloin over in the pan, ensuring that the proscuitto does not fall off the meat. Sprinkle with a bit of salt and pepper.
#Reduce the sauce to about half of the original volume, and pour in the rest of the cream and wine. 
#Turn the tenderloin over again.
#Put the linguine in the boiling water and sti occasionally. You may choose to put the chopped proscuitto in at this point.
#Once the sauce has reduced down again, lower the heat and remove the pork from the oven. Place it on a clean cutting board and let it sit for a few minutes. 
#Strain the linguine and start slicing the tenderloin into small medallions. 
#Place the desired amount of linguine on each plate, and place a few medallions on top. Spoon sauce over the top.

Serves 3-4 people.

'''Kheer''' or '''payasam''' is a thick rice pudding.

==Ingredients==
*1 [[Cookbook:L|L]] (4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]]) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*250 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]] (1 cup) long grain white [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]]
*125 mL (½ cup) white [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*65 mL (¼ cup) [[Cookbook:Sultana|sultanas]]
*6 [[Cookbook:Cardamom|cardamom]] pods
*65 mL (¼ cup) slivered blanched [[Cookbook:Almond|almonds]]
*15 mL (1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|T]]) [[Cookbook:Rosewater|rosewater]]

==Procedure==
# Bring the milk to a boil.
# Add rice and cook slowly until thick (about 20 minutes).
# Stir in the sugar, sultanas (raisins), and the ground seeds from the cardamom pods (cook a further 5 minutes).
# Stir in the almonds and rosewater, and cover until ready to serve.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Stir the milk while bringing it to the boil.
*You may also want to leave the kheer boiling for much longer (several hours), until it has been significantly reduced; this provides a stronger flavour and a light-pink colour.
*You can use rice flour instead of plain rice.
*For kheer that is not too thick when cold, use 170 mL (⅔ cup) of rice instead.
*If to be eaten cold, it's nicer to use double the quantities of sugar, sultanas, and almonds.

==Warnings==
*The main difficulty in this dish is preventing the kheer from sticking to the bottom of the pan, that requires care.

Krummelpap is traditionally eaten at breakfast, mostly with a bit of milk, butter, and sugar, or at dinner, where it is served with a sauce like gravy.

It is slowly cooked on a stove.

==Ingredients==
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
*250 ml water (boiling/hot) or more as needed
*700 ml maize

==Procedure==
#Add maize and salt to a large pot (like the one used for rice).
#Add a third af the water and mix with a fork so that it makes little balls or crumbs.
#Add more water but only a little at a time while mixing. Make sure that you don't add too much water.
#Put the stove on a LOW heat and stir with a fork every 10 minutes. Keep the lid on; it is the steam that cooks the maize.
#Taste it after 35 minutes to test if it is done. If it still tastes like maize, leave it - the wonder of this porridge is that you can't overcook, but you can burn it.
#It takes approximately 50 minutes to cook.

This recipe describes how to make home-made ''Marshmallows''. They can be used in [[:Category:Marshmallow recipes|any recipe that calls for marshmallows]].
 
==Ingredients==
*About 1 cup confectioners' sugar 
*3 1/2 envelopes (2 tablespoons plus 2 1/2 teaspoons) unflavored gelatin 
*1/2 cup cold water 
*2 cups granulated sugar 
*1/2 cup light corn syrup 
*1/2 cup hot water (about 115 degrees) 
*1/4 teaspoon salt 
*2 large egg whites 
*1 teaspoon vanilla extract

==Procedure==
Oil bottom and sides of a 13 by 9 by 2-inch rectangular metal baking pan and dust bottom and sides with some confectioners' sugar.

In bowl of standing electric mixer or in a large bowl sprinkle gelatin over cold water and let stand to soften.
In a 3-quart heavy saucepan cook granulated sugar, corn syrup, hot water, and salt over low heat, stirring with a wooden spoon, until sugar is dissolved. Increase heat to moderate and boil mixture, without stirring, until a candy or digital thermometer registers 240 degrees, about 12 minutes. Remove pan from heat and pour sugar mixture over gelatin mixture, stirring until gelatin is dissolved.

With standing or a hand-held electric mixer beat mixture on high speed until white, thick and nearly tripled in volume, about 6 minutes if using standing mixer or about 10 minutes if using hand-held mixer. In a large bowl with cleaned beaters beat whites (or reconstituted powdered whites) until they just hold stiff peaks. Beat whites and vanilla into sugar mixture until just combined. Pour mixture into baking pan and sift 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar evenly over top. Chill marshmallow, uncovered, until firm, at least three hours, and up to 1 day.

Run a thin knife around edges of pan and invert pan onto large cutting board. Lifting up 1 corner of inverted pan, with fingers loosen marshmallow and let drop onto cutting board. With a large knife trim edges of marshmallow and cut marshmallows into roughly 1-inch cubes. Sift remaining confectioners' sugar into a large bowl and add marshmallows in batches, tossing to evenly coat.

==Variation==
Coat with toasted coconut or cocoa powder instead of powdered sugar.

'''Grotten Hans''' is a recipe that has been called a big dumpling but is basically steamed sweet bread.  The recipe was traditional in the German areas of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.ndsu.nodak.edu/grhc/archrecipes/index.cgi?cat=German-Russian NDSU Recipe Index]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ingredients==
*¼ [[Cookbook:Cup|c]]. [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]] or [[Cookbook:Corn oil|oil]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]]. [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
*1 c. [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*2 tsp. [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
*½ c. [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*3 [[Cookbook:egg|eggs]], beaten
*3 c. [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]

==Procedure==
# Cream lard, sugar and salt.  Add eggs. Mix flour and baking powder.  
# Add this flour mixture to the lard mixture alternatively with the milk. Mix well.  
# Pour into a well-greased 2-pound coffee can.  A piece of wax paper on the bottom of the can works well.  Cover with foil, and tie this on with a string.  
# Set this tin into a large kettle of hot water several (3) inches deep.  This will steam the dumpling.  Cook for 2 hours.  The old way was to dip a towel in hot water, then cold water, then sprinkle with flour.  
# Pour dumpling onto towel and tie up.  Drop into boiling water and cook 2 hours.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
Raisin Sauce:
*2 c. [[Cookbook:raisin|raisins]]
*2 c. [[Cookbook:water|water]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]
*1 scant tsp. [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*½ c. [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]

Mix raisins, water, lemon juice, cinnamon and sugar.  Simmer for 1 hour.  Thicken with cornstarch. Serve over Grotten Hans.  Cherry sauce is nice also.

Serve with ham.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Soup|Soup]]

'''Easy Wedding Soup''' is a simple variation on [[Cookbook:Italian Wedding Soup|Italian Wedding Soup]] that requires only four ingredients and water.

==Ingredients==

* 6 cups [[Cookbook:Broth|chicken broth]] (from [[Cookbook:Bouillon Cubes|bouillon cubes]] is fine)
* 2 cups [[Cookbook:water|water]]
* 1 10 oz packet frozen [[Cookbook:spinach|spinach]]
* 12 oz spicy [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausage]] (pre-cooked)
* 3 tbsp [[Cookbook:acini di pepe|acini di pepe]] (''pastina'', little bead-like [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]])

==Procedure==
# Bring broth and water to [[Cookbook:Boiling|boil]] in 4 quart [[Cookbook:saucepan|saucepan]].
# Add frozen spinach.
# Cut sausage into small pieces.
# Add sausage and acini di pepe
# Bring back to boil and allow to boil for 10 minutes.

==Notes, Tips, and Variations==
* Calorie content may vary depending on the specific ingredients you use; 80 kcal is reasonable.
* The spicy sausage will impart more subtle flavor to the soup, making further spicing unnecessary.  Using different types of sausage will vastly change the character of the soup.
* This recipe may require salt if you use home made chicken stock.  Bouillon cubes tend to be heavily salted already.

'''Biscuits''' are a type of [[Cookbook:Quickbread|quickbread]] usually served with [[Cookbook:Dinner|dinner]], especially for a holiday meal. Rarely, biscuits are served for [[Cookbook:Breakfast|breakfast]]. Eaters typically apply [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]], [[Cookbook:Jam|jam]], or [[Cookbook:Jelly|jelly]] to their biscuits. For breakfast, an eater might add a [[Cookbook:Fried Egg|fried egg]], fried [[Cookbook:Ham|ham]], or [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]]. Sometimes biscuits are served with [[Cookbook:Gravy|gravy]].

Biscuits come in two forms, cut and dropped. Cut biscuits use a fairly normal dough that is [[Cookbook:Rolling Pin|rolled]] out and cut with a circular [[Cookbook:Cookie Cutter|cookie cutter]]. Drop biscuits use a somewhat more liquid dough that is dropped onto a [[Cookbook:Cookie Sheet|cookie sheet]] with a spoon.

==Ingredients==
*2 [[Cookbook:Cup|c]] (240 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1/3 c (80 mL) [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]] or [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]]
*1 c (240 mL) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] for drop biscuits, or 3/4 c (180 mL) milk for cut biscuits
*1/3 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|t]] (2 mL) [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|T]] (15 mL) [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]

==Procedure==
#Mix the dry ingredients.
#Cut (mix) in the [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]], preferably as you would for an [[Cookbook:Apple Crisp|apple crisp]] or traditional pie crust.
#Add the milk, mixing only as needed to wet the dough or batter.
#If doing drop biscuits, you'll plop the batter by spoonfuls (large spoonfuls) onto the cookie sheet. Otherwise, for cut biscuits:
##Give the dough a quick [[Cookbook:Kneading|knead]].
##Roll the dough out to 1/2[[Cookbook:Inch|&quot;]], using flour as needed to avoid sticking.
##Cut circles with a 2.5&quot; cookie cutter, or carve hexagons (a honeycomb pattern) with a knife.
#Space the biscuits 1&quot; apart on the cookie sheet.
#[[Cookbook:Baking|Bake]] 10 to 12 minutes in a [[Cookbook:Oven_Temperatures|450°F]] [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]], stopping when lightly browned on top.
#Serve hot.

== Authentic Italian Marinara Sauce ==
The recipe below has way more ingredients than any marinara sauce I've seen. It may still be to your liking. This sauce is easy and tastes great over any kind of pasta. It could also be used on toast or as a pizza sauce.

=== Ingredients ===
*1/4 cup of [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*A clove of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
*1 35-[[Cookbook:Ounce|oz.]] can imported (Pelati preferred) Italian [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], or 2 16-[[Cookbook:Ounce|oz.]] cans crushed tomatoes)
*1 handful [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]] leaves, washed, patted dry, and chopped
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Black Pepper|pepper]] to taste
*chopped [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]] (optional)
*1/2 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] (optional)

=== Procedure ===
#Gently heat the olive oil in a large saucepan.
#Add a thin slice of garlic to the hot oil.
#Once the garlic starts to turn brown, carefully remove it from the oil and discard.
#Crush the tomatoes and add their juices. Diced tomatoes can be substituted for easier crushing. [[Cookbook:Tomato_Paste|Tomato paste]] can be combined with the tomatoes, but you must add the sugar to cut down on the tart flavor of the paste.
#Fill the empty tomato can 1/4 of the way with water and pour in with the tomatoes. Skip this if the diced or stewed tomatoes seem to have enough liquid.
#Add the basil, salt, and pepper. Fresh basil is best, but dried can be used.
#Bring to a [[Cookbook:Boiling|boil]].
#Lower heat to a [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]].
#Cook until thickened.

== Modified Marinara Sauce ==

Goes well with rotini!

=== Ingredients ===
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*[[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*3 cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], chopped
*1/3 [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]]
*2 [[Cookbook:mm|mm]] deep [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*56 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz.]] crushed [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Pound|lb.]] ground beef
*[[Cookbook:Red Wine|red wine]]
*[[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]] leaves
*[[Cookbook:Basil|basil]] leaves
*[[Cookbook:Black Pepper|black pepper]]
*crushed [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|red peppers]]

=== Procedure ===
#[[Cookbook:Sauteeing|Saute]] the chopped onions and garlic in the olive oil.
#When the onions are translucent, add more oil, and stir.
#Brown the [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] and [[Cookbook:Browning|brown]] in a separate pan. When it is brown, add to the saute.
#Add the tomatoes.
#After 5-7 minutes, add the salt, sugar, red wine, basil leaves, oregano, black pepper and red peppers.
#Stir.
#Lower temperature. After 15 minutes, taste.

These little confections are great one-per-afternoon snacks. These badboys are dense and will give you an euphoric high on sweets but make you want to go work out after.

==Ingredients==

*1 [[Cookbook:Pound|lb.]] (450g) [[Cookbook:Cream Cheese|cream cheese]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Eggs|eggs]]
*3/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] (180g) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*semi-sweet [[Cookbook:chocolate chips|chocolate chips]]

==Equipment==
*[[Cookbook:Cupcake papers|cupcake papers]]
*[[Cookbook:Cupcake Pan|cupcake pan]]
*[[Cookbook:Microwave oven|microwave oven]]
*[[Cookbook:Oven|oven]]
*[[Cookbook:Mixing bowl|mixing bowl]]
*[[Cookbook:Double boiler|double boiler]] (optional)

==Procedure==

#Preheat your [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]] to [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|350°F]] (180°C).
#Soften the cream cheese in the [[Cookbook:Microwave Oven|microwave]] in a bowl. Thirty seconds on a medium setting should be sufficient.
#Combine the cream cheese, eggs, and sugar.
#Line the pan with the papers.
#Put chocolate chips in the bottom of the cupcake papers - less than a full layer; do not completely cover the bottom of the papers.
#Fill the cups with the mixture, then place into the oven.
#[[Cookbook:Bake|Bake]] for about 15 minutes. The chocolate will melt and create a bottom to your cakes, but part of that chocolate will also bubble up through the cream cheese for an added effect.
#Remove and allow to cool for 20 minutes, until the chocolate hardens on the bottom and becomes crunchy.

You can also garnish the top of the cakes with chocolate that you melt in a [[Cookbook:double boiler|double boiler]]. I added a dollop of chocolate little larger than a quarter on the top.

The '''Vegemite sandwich''' is a simple dish, which is known to frequent the lunchboxes of school children and the plates of casual breakfasters alike. The lunchbox variety often involves two slices of bread, whereas the breakfast variety usually only involves one, and is often toasted. Margarine may be used as a replacement for the butter, however in modern times it is becoming common for margarine/butter to be considered an optional ingredient.

==Ingredients==
* [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]
* [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* [[Cookbook:Vegemite|Vegemite]]

== Procedure ==
# Spread butter thickly and unevenly on bread.
# Spread Vegemite a little less thickly, and unevenly on bread.
# A slice of cheese can be added at this point. (optional)

==Notes, tips and variations==
* A variation is to add avocado for an avocado and Vegemite sandwich.
* Yet another variation is to spread Vegemite and then place sliced onions and a slice of cheese on toast and then place under a grill or toaster to melt the cheese.
* Some consumers assert that white sliced bread will give a superior result.

The '''frikadeller''' - as [[w:Denmark|Danish]] as the [[w:Dannebrog|Dannebrog]].

This is standard Danish fare, made of ground [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] and [[Cookbook:Veal|veal]].  Traditionally served with [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiled]] [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], [[Cookbook:Gravy|gravy]] and [[Cookbook:Rødkål|rødkaal]] ([[Cookbook:Braising|braised]] red [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]]). Originally, this dish was made so that the meat would feed more people, and thus, the possibilities as to what can be added are numerous. 

These can be frozen and reheated.

==Ingredients==
*250 [[Cookbook:g|grams]] ground [[Cookbook:Veal|veal]]
*250 grams ground [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]]
*1 large [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
*1 finely chopped [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*20% by volume of [[Cookbook:Bread Crumb|bread crumbs]] (or approx 3/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]])
*[[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] and [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste

*[[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] (optional)
*substitute bread crumbs with [[Cookbook:Wheat Germ|wheat germ]] and/or [[Cookbook:Oat Bran|oat bran]]
*ground [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]] to taste
*Any ingredient will work. Many people add a quantity of milk also, and the mixture is then thickened again with more flour, bread crumbs and/or oat bran.

==Procedure==
#Mix all ingredients.
#Make small patties.
#[[Cookbook:Frying|Fry]] in hot [[Cookbook:Skillet|skillet]] with (lots of) butter.

'''Baba ganoush''' is a common Middle Eastern and Mediterranean dip with a creamy, somewhat smoky flavor. It is usually eaten with [[Cookbook:Pita|pita bread]] although [[Cookbook:Naan|naan]] or a crispy [[Cookbook:Flatbread|flatbread]] also work well.

==Ingredients==
* 1 medium-large [[Cookbook:Eggplant|eggplant]], any variety, 1 to 1&amp;frac12; [[Cookbook:Pound|pounds]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] raw [[Cookbook:Tahini|tahini]]
* Juice of 1 [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]] 
* 1 clove [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], crushed
* 3 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Olive oil|olive oil]]
* ½ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* [[Cookbook:Paprika|Paprika]] or [[Cookbook:Cayenne_pepper|cayenne pepper]], as a garnish

==Procedure==
# Roast the eggplant. This can be done in a variety of ways, but the flesh should be fully cooked and the skin should be burned and falling off easily. An effective method is to prick the eggplant and place it a few inches under a broiler, turning it as the exposed skin blackens, about every 3-4 minutes. Place a pan underneath to catch the juices, and discard them. 
# Scrape off the eggplant skin. It's all right if you miss a few burned bits.
# Finely chop or blend the eggplant flesh with the rest of the ingredients. The consistency should be smooth. Reserve a bit of the olive oil, and drizzle that over the top. Sprinkle with some paprika or cayenne.

'''Chocolate truffles''' are soft chocolate balls. This recipe makes about 24.

==Ingredients==
*8[[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] (227[[Cookbook:g|g]]) bittersweet/plain [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]] (chopped into small pieces)
*6 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] (likely Imperial ones: 108 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]], 7.2 US tablespoons, or 2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] shy of 1/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]]) [[Cookbook:Double Cream|double cream]] (48% fat)
*[[Cookbook:Cocoa Powder|cocoa powder]]
*[[Cookbook:Icing sugar|Icing sugar]]

In the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|USA]], try using 2 tablespoons unsalted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] with 5 1/3 tablespoons heavy cream.

==Procedure==
# Put the chocolate in a bowl and set over (a [[Cookbook:Double Boiler|double boiler]]).
# Heat until melted and smooth, stirring occasionally.
# Remove from the pot of hot water.
# Add the cream and stir well.
# Leave to cool.
# Cover and refrigerate for 35 minutes or until the mixture is just firm enough to hold its shape.
# [[Cookbook:Sifting|Sift]] a layer of cocoa powder and icing sugar together onto a plate.  The icing sugar is to make sure the cocoa powder isn't too bitter.  
# Take a heaped [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoonful]] of the chocolate mixture and shape it into a ball.
# Roll each truffle in the cocoa powder/icing sugar to coat all over in an even layer.  Shake off the excess and set on a tray.
# Continue shaping and coating the remaining truffles. Set on a tray, making sure they don't touch each other.
# Cover and refrigerate. Remove 15 minutes before serving.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the Netherlands|Dutch Cuisine]] | [[Cookbook:Dessert|Desserts]]

This is an old [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the Netherlands|Dutch]] recipe for a very 'powerful' chocolate pie.

== Ingredients ==

=== Crust ===
* 2-3 packs of 'maria' biscuits (also known as '[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_tea Rich Tea Biscuits]')
* cold black coffee (important)

=== Filling ===
* 150/200 gram [[Cookbook:Cocoa Powder|cocoa powder]]
* 150/200 gram [[Cookbook:Granulated_Sugar| granulated sugar]]
* 250-500 [[Cookbook:g|grams]] of real [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] (use about 750grams or something for more then 2 layers of biscuits, and adjust cocoa/sugar amount to match or adjust to taste :)
* some [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] (about 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]])

=== Topping ===
* chocolate sprinkles (dutch: hagelslag)

=== Tools ===
* a dish of some sort with high enough edges (this is important too, an [[Cookbook:Pie Pan|apple pie baking mold]] or similar '[[Cookbook:Springform Pan|springvorm]]' will probably do. about 26[[Cookbook:cm|cm]] in diameter)
* cooking pot that can take all the filling ingredients
* a spoon (preferably a [[Cookbook:Wooden_Spoon|wooden spoon]])

== Procedure ==
# take a wide/big pan and melt the butter
# add the sugar and stir/disolve this this into the butter
# stir the cocoa through the sugar/butter mixture. optionally make this a little more liquid with some milk (not too much!!)
# take the biscuits and dip them into the cold black coffee. put these on the bottom of the dish.
# after creating a layer of biscuits pour/smear the chocolate mix ontop of it.
# then make another layer with dipped biscuits and pour/smear another layer of chocolate
# repeat this until you run out of chocolate/biscuits.
# finally place the chocolate sprinkels on top and put it in the fridge until it's hard enough to consume.
# enjoy!

== Notes, Tips, and Variations ==
* measurements shouldn't be taken to precise, play with the ammounts to your likings
* milk is optional.. and too much will make the cake less solid
===Vegan Variation===
Remove the milk, remove the chocolate sprinkles(unless you have vegan ones) and replace the butter by 2/3 [[Cookbook:Soy|soy]] butter and 1/3 [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]], or just all margarine.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}}

==Ingredients==

* 250g of [[Cookbook:Pancetta|pancetta]]
* 1 tbsp [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Mincing|minced]] [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* 1 lb [[Cookbook:Shallot|shallots]] (12-15 large)
* 1/2 tsp of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]], [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* 1.5 cups of [[Cookbook:Chicken Stock|chicken stock]]
* 1/4 cup of [[Cookbook:Heavy Cream|heavy cream]]
* 1 cup tightly packed [[Cookbook:Herbs|herbs]] ([[Cookbook:Rosemary|rosemary]], [[Cookbook:Sage|sage]], [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]], [[Cookbook:Marjoram|marjoram]], [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]], [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]])
* 500g [[Cookbook:Fusilli|fusilli]]
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* 1.5 cups [[Cookbook:Parmigiano Reggiano|parmigiano reggiano]]

==Procedure==

# Place pancetta in a large saute pan and cook over medium-low heat stirring occasionally until crisp about 15 minutes. Using a slotted spoon remove from pan and drain on paper towels. Set aside. Pour off all but 1 T of the fat.
# Add butter to the fat in the pan. Add garlic, shallots and sugar and season lightly with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to lowest setting and cook covered until shallots are soft and transparent about 15 minutes. Remove lid raise heat to medium high and cook stirring constantly until they have a deep golden-brown coating about 10 minutes. Do not allow to burn.
# Add the stock and simmer until reduced by one-third stirring to loosen brown bits from bottom of pan about 7 minutes. The sauce can be prepared up to this point several hours ahead and kept covered in the refrigerator. 
# Bring a large pot of water to a boil for the pasta. (Reheat the shallot mixture if it was prepared in advance.) If using add cream to shallots and simmer for 2 minutes over high heat until sauce thickens slightly. Keep warm. Coarsely chop all but a small handful of herbs.
# Cook pasta according to package directions. Drain and return to pot. Add chopped herbs to sauce and cook for another minute. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add pasta to sauce and toss together over low heat for 1 minute. (As pasta and sauce heat, saute remaining herbs in 1/2 t olive oil until crisp for garnish.) Stir in pancetta and 1/2 C of the grated cheese. Divide the pasta among 4 bowls. Garnish with sauteed herbs. Serve remaining cheese on the side.

This makes 4-6 servings.

==Variations and Additions==

Given the strong and flavorful nature of this dish, when choosing a meat or other food to go along with this you must keep in mind that the two must not overpower each other. Grilling a small medallion of sirloin steak with garlic and red wine would go along perfectly with this, or perhaps a seared pork tenderloin medallion with white wine and ground pepper.

'''Marsala Chicken Scallopini''' is a meal in the style of Italian cuisine, with mouthwatering flavors gotten from the fortified Marsala wine.

==Ingredients==
*2 boneless skinless [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] breasts
* 4 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* 3 tsp [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] dry [[Cookbook:Marsala Wine|marsala wine]]
* 1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]/chicken [[Cookbook:Stock|stock]]

* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]]
* fresh [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]]

==Preparation==
# Put each chicken breast in a plastic bag and flatten with a [[Cookbook:Meat Tenderizer|meat tenderizer]]. Coarsely [[Cookbook:Chop|chop]] the basil, and then [[Cookbook:Throwing|throw]] it in a deep [[Cookbook:Baking Pan|baking pan]] along with some flour, oregano, and [[Cookbook:Tossing|toss]] the chicken with it.
# Melt 2 tsp of butter in a medium fry pan on low-medium heat. When the butter stops bubbling, add the chicken and brown each section approximately 3 minutes for each side. Once this is done, cover and set aside on a separate plate.
# Drain off most of the liquid from the pan, and raise the heat. Pour a dollop of olive oil in, and sear the asparagus quickly. Remove this and set aside.
# Keep at high heat, add the marsala and 1/4 of the stock. [[Cookbook:Boiling|Boil]] off for a few minutes. Lower the heat, and return the asparagus to the pan. Add the remaining stock and boil off to reduce. Add a tsp of butter, and cover chicken with sauce.

This recipe makes enough dough for one 9 inch covered pie. If your pie only requires a bottom crust, use half this recipe. Note: for best results, make the full recipe.  If only a single crust is required, make the full recipe and freeze half for later.

In contrast to [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]], pie crust and other pastries should be made in a way that minimizes the development of [[Cookbook:Gluten|gluten]]. Once the water has been added, the dough should be worked as little as possible, to minimize toughness in the finished crust.

== Ingredients ==
* 2 1/2 cups (310 grams) [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1 teaspoon (6 grams) [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 teaspoon (4 grams) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] (optional)
* 1 cup cold (225 grams) [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* 1/3 cup plus 1 Tablespoon (80 mL plus 15 mL) cold water

== Procedure ==
# Whisk 2 1/2 cups flour, 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon sugar together in a deep bowl.
# Cut 1 cup cold butter into small pieces and add to the flour mixture.
# Using a [[Cookbook:Pastry Blender|pastry blender]] or two butter knives, cut the butter into the flour until the butter is in small pea-sized pieces.
# Add 1/3 cup plus 1 Tablespoon cold water; cut the water into the flour-butter mixture with the edge of a rubber [[Cookbook:Spatula|spatula]] until it is evenly moistened and will hold together when pressed.
# Form the dough into a ball with your hands, kneading in any loose flour. This should be done as quickly as possible to avoid melting the butter in the dough.
# Chill the dough for 10-20 minutes.
# Cut the dough evenly in half.
# On a lightly floured board, roll each half out until it will cover a 9 inch pie dish, with about 3/4&quot; inch overhang.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== To Form a Covered Pie ==
# Lay the bottom crust in the pie dish, ensuring that there are no gaps between the crust and the bottom of the dish.
# Fill the crust with the pie filling.
# Place the top crust on top, leaving equal overhang on all sides.
# Cut the overhang to about 3/4 of an inch all around the pie.
# Working around the pie, hold the bottom and top crust overhangs together and tuck the combined overhang into the pie dish behind the bottom crust.
# With the forefinger and thumb of each hand, pinch the ridge formed by the tuck into a decorative edge, or press this ridge with a fork.
# Brush the top of the pie with milk, and sprinkle with sugar.
# Cut vents in the top crust so that steam can escape.
# For a fruit pie, bake on the lower-middle rack of an oven at 425 degress Fahrenheit for 30 minutes to set the crust, then at 350 degreess Fahrenheit for 30 minutes to cook the filling. 

Note: When baking two pies at once, rotate the pies 180 degrees at 15 minutes and 45 minutes to ensure the crust does not burn due to its proximity to the oven walls.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
;Vegan: Use a [[Cookbook:Vegan_Substitutions|hard vegan fat]], such as [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]] in place of the butter. (used for the images shown above)
;Traditional: Use [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]], which is less saturated than butter and produces the flakiest crusts.
;Top Crust Colouring: Brush on lightly beaten egg white to colour crust instead of milk.

A '''pupusa''' is a stuffed [[Cookbook:Tortilla|corn-tortilla]], usually served with a spicy [[Cookbook:Coleslaw|coleslaw]] called '''curtido'''. This recipe makes both.

Pupusas are hand-made and thick. Like all corn tortillas, they are made using [[Cookbook:Corn Masa|corn masa]]. They are stuffed with one or more of the following:
*[[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]] ''(queso)'' (usually a soft Salvadoran cheese called Quesillo)
*[[Cookbook:Frying|fried]] [[Cookbook:Pork Rind|pork rind]] ''(chicharrones)''
*[[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] ''(pollo)''
*[[Cookbook:Refried Beans|refried beans]] ''(frijoles refritos)''
*''queso y [[Cookbook:Loroco|loroco]]'' (loroco is a shrub flower bud from [[Cookbook:Central American cuisines|Central America]])
There is also the ''pupusa revueltas'' (with mixed ingredients of cheese, pork, and [[Cookbook:Bean|beans]]). Pupusas are from El Salvador, but immigrants have brought the dish to Southern [[Cookbook:California cuisine|California]], where there are now many pupuserias (places where pupusas are sold). Pupusas are usually served with curtido and [[Cookbook:Tomato Sauce|tomato sauce]]. They are eaten with the fingers.

==Preparing the dough==
There are different brands of corn masa to make the dough. MASECA, which can be found in most large supermarkets in the international section, is one of them but there are others. Follow the instructions on the bag for making tortilla dough, and make as much dough as needed. (One pupusa uses about as much dough as two tortillas.) Once the dough has been prepared set it aside while you prepare the filling.

==Three Fillings==
===Cheese===
*3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] of shredded [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]] (use hard and cream cheese mixed together; you can mix frying cheese, [[Cookbook:Mozzarella Cheese|mozzarella]] and [[Cookbook:Ricotta Cheese|ricotta]])
*3 or 4 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] of [[Cookbook:Heavy Cream|heavy cream]]
*1/2 to 1 cup of ''[[Cookbook:Loroco|loroco]]'' (this will be hard to find in the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|U.S.]] So you can use very finely chopped [[Cookbook:Green Pepper|green peppers]] or [[Cookbook:Scallion|scallions]] instead)
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste
**Or to avoid all these complications, try find a specialty store and buy queso con loroco( you won't get the authentic flavor from a pupusa if you use american ingredients)

Make a paste with these ingredients. To avoid the paste leaking, it should not be too soft.

===Chicharron (Pork Rind Filling)===
*1 cup cooked [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]] (cooked with [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], see below).
*4 - 5 [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Green Pepper|green pepper]]
*salt to taste.

Cook bacon with some garlic (optional). Set [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]] aside but do not discard. Once cooked, grind bacon with the tomatoes, 1 green pepper, and salt to taste. Mix with some of the bacon fat until it has a soft consistency

===Revueltas===
Ground and [[Cookbook:Frying|fried]] beans (they can be canned or prepared from your favorite recipe).

When filling the pupusas add beans, chicharrón and cheese (or combine two of the three).

==Making the pupusas==
With two tablespoons of dough make a ball using your hands and later clap your hands until you make a round, thin ([[Cookbook:Inch|1/8 of an inch]] thick) tortilla. Continue making more tortillas this way. Put filling over one tortilla, cover with another and push down the sides to close them. This is the &quot;beginners&quot; method.

People who have experience do it this way: make a ball with the dough. Insert your thumb in the ball and make a hole in the center. Fill that hole with the filling, close the hole by pushing the dough on the sides up. Clap your hands carefully so that the filling doesn't come out and flatten the ball.

Cook on a slightly greased [[Cookbook:Griddle|griddle]], [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|pan]] or electric pancake griddler and cook over low-medium heat ([[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|325-350°F]]) first one side, then the other until they are cooked. Each side will be ready when it no longer sticks to the pan (depending on the thickness of the tortillas, this might take 4 minutes or more per side).

Pupusas are topped with pickled cabbage and tomato sauce. 

==Curtido (pickled colesaw)==
*chopped [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]] that has been quickly passed through [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiling]] water
*medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], sliced
*[[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]], finely shredded
*cooked [[Cookbook:Green Bean|green beans]], not too soft (optional)
*[[Cookbook:Beet|beets]] (optional)
*[[Cookbook:Horseradish|horseradish]] (optional).
*[[Cookbook:Red Pepper|red pepper]], finely chopped (optional)
*[[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
*water
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste

In a glass or plastic jar with wide opening mix all the ingredients. Add vinegar and water to taste. Mix with a [[Cookbook:Wooden Spoon|wooden spoon]] (never metal). Put the mix in the refrigerator and let it rest for a week so that the ingredients [[Cookbook:Pickling|pickle]].

{{recipe}}

Oddly enough, '''refried beans''' ''(frijoles refritos)'' are only [[Cookbook:Frying|fried]] once. The prefix &quot;re&quot; is a [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Spain|Spanish]] prefix meaning &quot;very&quot; or &quot;well&quot;, inappropriately tacked onto a non-Spanish word.

==Ingredients==
*[[Cookbook:Bean|beans]], especially pinto beans or [[Cookbook:Black Bean|black beans]]
*home-rendered [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]]

==Procedure==
#If using dried beans, wash them and examine them for any rocks, then cover with water in a medium pot and [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]] until they are very soft. You'll need to cook the beans a long time on very low heat. You may add salt to the water. You may add onion halves or a [[Cookbook:Ham|ham]] bone, which you can remove at the end. You may wish to soak the beans overnight in the refrigerator before cooking them. Expect the cooking to take at least 3 hours, if not 6 or more.
#If using canned beans, rinse them. Try to make sure they are not slimy or too salty.
#Get a large wide pot or tall-sided [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]].
#Smash the beans, perhaps with a potato masher.
#Add home-rendered [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]], totalling up to 20% of the total. (25% of the amount prior to adding)
#Fry the beans, stirring and turning them until they thicken as desired.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Meat Recipes|Meat Recipes]] | [[Cookbook:Vegetarian cuisine|Vegetarian]]

This is a very quick, easy Pineapple Teriyaki entrée, to be served over rice.  It is listed as both meat and vegetarian because it works around the pineapple, veggies, and teriyaki, not the protein.  Put the rice on to cook first, and the rest will probably be finished by the time the rice is ready.  

A [[Cookbook:Teriyaki|Teriyaki recipe]] is available
for those who cannot or do not wish to purchase prepared teriyaki sauce.

==Ingredients==
===For the rice===
* 2 [[Cookbook:Cup|c]] [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] (your choice, but a short-grain white rice is most traditional)
* 2 [[Cookbook:Cup|c]] [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* a little [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
Bring all to a boil in a pot or rice cooker.  In a pot, cover, turn the heat down when it boils.  Simmer for 20 minutes with the lid on, then turn off the heat, fluff with a fork, and let stand for a few minutes.

===For on top of the rice===
*1-2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|T]] vegetable or olive [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]
*2 c cubed [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] '''or''' *2 c cubed [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]] or vegetarian &quot;chicken&quot; (usually flavored, pressed [[Cookbook:Gluten|gluten]])
*1 yellow or white [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*1-2 [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell peppers]], whatever color(s) you prefer. Red and green stand out nicely against yellow pineapple.
*1 14-16 oz. can of cubed [[Cookbook:Pineapple|pineapple]], drained (Pineapple is often canned in juice, so you may wish to save what you drain.)
* 1/4 c (approx.) prepared [[Cookbook:Teriyaki Sauce|teriyaki sauce]].  Soy Vay! Veri Veri Teriyaki is excellent, if available.
===Optional===
If you’d like more or thicker sauce, mix 
* 1/4 c of water or reserved pineapple juice 
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|T]] [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]] 

You might also like to toss in 
*some sliced [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]] 
*1-2 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], [[Cookbook:Mincing|minced]], depending upon your teriyaki sauce

==Method==

#Put rice on to cook, as outlined above.
#Cut up the chicken/tofu, onion, and bell pepper(s) into bite-sized chunks.  Cut up everything before turning on the stove.
#Heat a deep 12&quot; pan or wok over high heat. 
#Add the oil.
#[[Cookbook:Sautéing|Sauté]] everything in the oil, adding ingredients in the following order, so as to cook heavier items longer:
#*Chicken
#*Onion/garlic
#*Bell peppers
#*Mushrooms 
#*Pineapple
#*Tofu
#Add the teriyaki sauce and the cornstarch mixture.  If using cornstarch, heat to boiling to thicken and correct with extra water or juice as necessary.
#Serve over rice.

'''Cardamom bread''' is a sweet yeast bread of Scandinavian origin which is good served at breakfast, with coffee, or as a light dessert. This recipe makes two loaves.

==Ingredients==
* 1 pkg [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]], around 2.5 tsp
* 1/4 c warm water
* 3/4 c warm [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 1/2 c [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1/2 t [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Eggs|eggs]]
* 1 tsp ground [[Cookbook:Cardamom|cardamom]] (about 20 green pods)
* 4 1/2 c [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1/2 c [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* grated peel of 1 [[Cookbook:Orange|orange]]

==Procedure==
# In a large [[Cookbook:mixing bowl|mixing bowl]], mix flour, salt and orange peel; [[Cookbook:whisk|whisk]] gently to distribute the ingredients.
# Split green cardamom pods and remove the seeds inside. With a [[Cookbook:Mortar and pestle|mortar and pestle]], grind the seeds into a powder and add this to the other dry ingredients.
# In a small bowl, combine yeast, warm water and sugar. Stir gently for a few seconds, then let stand until the yeast is frothy.
# In a small saucepan on low heat, combine butter and milk until the butter is just melted.
# In a separate bowl, beat 2 eggs and set aside.
# Check that the milk and butter mixture is not hot, then add the it into the dry ingredients and mix.
# [[Cookbook:Knead|Knead]] the dough until it is smooth and elastic. 
# Place the kneaded dough in a greased bowl and let [[Cookbook:rise|rise]] in a warm place (in the oven, for example) until it doubles in size, about one hour.
# [[Cookbook:Punch down|Punch down]] the dough, and cut in two parts (one for each loaf).

=== Braiding ===

# For each of the halves, 
## Split the dough into three equal sized portions.
## Roll these into &quot;ropes&quot; about 18 inches long.
## Pinch one end of each rope together.
## Braid the ropes together:
### Take the left rope and cross it over the middle one.
### Take the right rope and cross it over the middle one.
### Repeat this procedure until the ropes are fully braided.
## Pinch the other end of the ropes together.
## Tuck each pinched end underneath the main loaf.
# Put finished braids on a greased [[Cookbook:cookie sheet|cookie sheet]].
# Let rise again until doubled in size, about 45 minutes.
# Prepare an egg wash by beating 1 egg thinned with water. 
# Brush the top of each braid with the egg wash.
# Sprinkle each braid with [[Cookbook:Pearl Sugar|pearl sugar]] and sliced [[Cookbook:Almond|almonds]].
# Bake at 180&amp;nbsp;°C (350&amp;nbsp;°Fahrenheit) for 25 minutes.

==Variations==
* For a [[Cookbook:Vegan cuisine|vegan]] version, substitute [[Cookbook:Soy_Milk|soy milk]] for milk, [[Cookbook:Egg_Replacer|egg replacer]] for eggs, and a vegan [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]] for butter.

==Notes==
* Store-bought ground cardamom can be used in this recipe, but has a less intense flavor than freshly ground cardamom.
* Orange peel is not traditional in cardamom bread.

'''Hash browns''' are like [[Cookbook:Hamburger|hamburgers]] made from [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]. Usually they are served with [[Cookbook:Ketchup|ketchup]]. This recipe makes enough for 2 to 4 people.

==Ingredients==
* two [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], washed
* one half [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], finely chopped (Optional)
* plenty of cooking [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] ([[Cookbook:Canola Oil|Canola]] is good &amp;mdash; see [[Cookbook:Smoke Point|smoke point]] information)
* two tablespoons of [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] OR one [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]

==Procedure==
# Grate the raw potatoes with a [[Cookbook:Grater|cheese grater]], place them into a bowl and cover completely with water. Let sit for 10 minutes.
# Place a large [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]] on medium-high heat and add enough oil to provide a thin coating over the entire bottom of the pan. 
# Drain the grated potatoes and mix in chopped onions by hand.
# Mix the one egg OR two tablespoons of flour into the hash brown mixture evenly. This will allow the hash browns to stay together when frying.
# When the oil has come up to temperature apply a large handful of potatoes to the pan and reshape into a patty that is about [[Cookbook:Inch|1/4 in]] ([[Cookbook:mm|6 mm]]) to 1/2 in (12 mm) thick. The thinner the patty the crispier the hash browns will be throughout. 
# The hash browns are ready to flip when they are crisp and brown on the cooking side. They should also stick together nicely before they are flipped. This should take about 5 to 8 minutes.
# The hash browns are done when the new side is brown and crispy. This should take another 3-5 minutes.

==Variation==
Try using [[Cookbook:Rosemary|rosemary]] instead of the onion.

*2 cups [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*4 [[Cookbook:Eggs|eggs]]
*2/3 cup [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*3 cups cooked [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] (brown rice works as well as, if not better than, white rice)
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]], if desired
*[[Cookbook:Cinnamon|Cinnamon]], [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]], [[Cookbook:Vanilla_extract|vanilla extract]] to taste

== Preparation ==

#Mix milk, eggs, sugar in a 3 quart casserole dish until thoroughly mixed and frothy.  
#Mix in cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla.  
#Mix in rice, then put in raisins.  Do not mix in raisins, or they will all wind up on the bottom!
#Place casserole in a larger baking pan with about 1 inch of water. 
#::This will keep the bottom from cooking too fast and burning.
#Bake in a 325 degree oven until set, about 1.5 hours.

'''Microwave Risotto'''. This risotto is made using the microwave. It requires
very little stirring and turns out quite well.

==Ingredients==

*3 cups simmering hot chicken broth
*1/2 Teaspoon Salt
*dash ground white or black pepper
*2 Tablespoons butter
*2 Tablespoons olive oil
*1/2 cup minced yellow onion
*1 cup uncooked medium grain rice

==Procedure==

#In a saucepan, bring chicken broth, salt and pepper to a low simmer, keep warm until needed.
#In 8&quot; x 8&quot; x 2&quot; pyrex dish (or 10&quot; [[Cookbook:Quiche|quiche]] dish), heat oil and butter in microwave for 2-minutes.
#Add minced onion to pyrex dish, stir to coat with oil, cook in microwave for 4-minutes.
#Add uncooked rice to pyrex dish, stir to coat with oil, cook in microwave for another 4-minutes.
#Pour simmering chicken broth into pyrex dish and stir well. Microwave 9-minutes. 
#Stir rice and chicken broth well and microwave another 9-minutes.
#If a creamier risotto is desired, add 1/4-cup warm water, stir well and microwave for another  2-minutes. 

Makes 3 main dish servings or 6 side dish servings.

==Notes, tips and variations==

#For a 750-watt microwave, use 100% power settings for each time interval. For 1000 or 1500-watt microwaves, use 70% power settings for each time interval.
#As a variation, use 2 1/2-cups chicken broth and 1/2-cup white wine.
#Freshly grated parmesan cheese may also be added after cooking.

[[Image:CookbookPlacentaBroccoli.jpg|right|thumb|192px]]
This is a tasty dish that the whole family will love. It might go well served with rice, especially if the rice is loose and firm.

You'll need about 1/2 the placenta of a 6.2 pound baby, or 1/3 the placenta of a 9.3 pound baby. Chopped and packed, this is just a bit more than 1/3 cup. (but like any raw meat, you don't exactly chop it &amp;mdash; try sniping away at it with a kitchen scissors)

==Ingredients==
*1/3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] chopped fresh human [[Cookbook:Placenta|placenta]]
*2/3 cup chopped [[Cookbook:Broccoli|broccoli]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] whites
*1/8 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|t]] [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]]
*[[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] for [[Cookbook:Frying|frying]]

==Procedure==
#Wash the placenta well, in a [[Cookbook:Colander|colander]], then shake it to drain. (it will still leak juices)
#Stir the egg whites with a fork until they are without lumps.
#Mix all ingredients well, squishing them by hand.
#Add a decent amount of oil to a suitable frying pan.
#Set a burner to high heat, and put the pan on it.
#Start frying, stiring as if stir-frying or scrambling an egg.
#The small amount of liquid (seeping from the placenta, plus the egg whites) will come to a boil. You might turn down the heat slightly at this point.
#Let the liquid boil away and/or solidify onto the broccoli and placenta.
#When it looks yummy, serve it.

==Warning==
As with any meat from uncontrolled sources (such as hunting or scavanging) people should be cautious of risks involved. Certain blood borne diseases can live in blood and tissue outside the body for some time. Be sure that sensible precautions have been taken.

'''Zuppa Toscana''' is a soup available at The Olive Garden restaurant.

*2 [[Cookbook:Garlic|Garlic]] Cloves - Crushed

*1 cup Heavy Whipped [[Cookbook:Cream|Cream]]
*Salt and pepper to taste

==Procedure==

#In skillet over medium-high heat, brown bacon. Drain and set aside.
#Place water, broth, potatoes, garlic, and onion into a pot. Simmer over high heat until potatoes are tender.
#Add sausage and bacon to the pot. Simmer for 10 minutes.
#Add kale/chard and cream to the pot. Seasons with salt and pepper; heat through.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
Potatoes can be substituted with cauliflower for a low carbohydrate version of this soup.  I also used 1/2 mild 1/2 spicy turkey sausage instead of pork sausage. Sometimes, fennel is used.

A classic dessert, with a light texture and a mild flavor.  This recipe is for &quot;boiled&quot; custard, but ironically, as Mrs. F.L. Gillette said in ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13923/13923-h/13923-h.htm The Whitehouse Cookbook]'', &quot;it must ''not'' boil or it will curdle.&quot;  See more on custard in general at [[Cookbook:Custard]].

== Ingredients ==
*2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
*1/4 to 1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] extract
*1 [[Cookbook:Pinch|pinch]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] (optional)
*1 [[Cookbook:tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]] (optional)
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Water|water]] (optional)

== Procedure ==  
# Heat milk and salt (if using) in a [[Cookbook:Double Boiler|double boiler]] until bubbles form around the edges.
# Beat eggs with sugar until uniform.
# Gradually mix approximately 1/2 cup hot milk into the egg mixture to ''temper'' it.
# Slowly stir egg mixture into remaining hot milk.
# Mix cornstarch and water (if using), and stir into custard.
# Stir over heat until thickened (should coat the spoon), ''without'' bringing to a boil.
# Remove from heat, and continue stirring to dry the custard slightly.
# Stir in vanilla before the dish has cooled completely.
# Serve warm or chilled.

==Variations==
*Replace vanilla extrace with [[Cookbook:Almond_Extract|almond]] or [[Cookbook:Maple Extract|maple extract]], [[Bartending:Brandy|brandy]] or grated [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon zest]].

*Stir 1/2 cup of sugar in a small frying pan until it becomes liquid and just begins to smoke. Stir it into the hot milk before adding the egg mixture.

{{recipesummary|French recipes|6|75 minutes|2|Image=[[Image:Quiche Lorraine.jpg|300px]]}}

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|Cuisine of France]]

A '''quiche''' is a [[Cookbook:Baking|baked]], [[Cookbook:Sweeteners|unsweetened]] [[Cookbook:Custard|custard]] [[Cookbook:Dessert#Pies, Tarts|pie]], often made with [[wiktionary:savory|savory]] fillings.  Originally served in [[wikipedia:Germany|Germany]], quiche was adopted by neighboring [[wikipedia:France|France]] and is now considered a traditional French dish.  The French (and now English) word ''quiche'' comes from a [[wiktionary:dialectal|dialectal]] form (''Küchle'') of the German word for [[Cookbook:Dessert#Cakes, cupcakes|cake]] (''Kuchen'').  Quiche became popular in [[wikipedia:Britain|Britain]] after [[wikipedia:World War II|World War II]] and in the [[wikipedia:United States|United States]] during the [[wikipedia:1960s|1960s]] and [[wikipedia:1970s|70s]].

==Ingredients==
*5 chicken [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]s
*1 1/3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (320 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]] (approximately 30% [[Cookbook:Oil and fat|fat]])
*1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (120 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) ''[[Cookbook:Condensed|condensed]]'' cream of mushroom [[Cookbook:Soup|soup]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] (5 mL) chopped ''fresh'' [[Cookbook:Tarragon|tarragon]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Dash|dash]] ground [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]]
*1/4 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] (1.25 mL) [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1/8 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] (0.7 mL) ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
*1 prepared frozen pie crust
*3/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (180 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) freshly-grated [[Cookbook:Swiss Cheese|Swiss cheese]]

==Procedure==
#Preheat [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]] to [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|375&amp;deg; Fahrenheit]] (190&amp;deg; Celsius)
#Place the eggs, cream, condensed soup, tarragon, nutmeg, salt, and pepper in a [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]]; blend ''as briefly as possible'' until they form a [[wikt:homogeneous|homogeneous]] mixture
#In the pie crust, create alternating layers of the shredded cheese and the mixture from the blender until the crust is full
#Bake the quiche for 35-40 minutes; a toothpick or fork inserted into its middle should come out &quot;clean&quot;
#Remove the quiche from the oven and let it cool for at least 20 minutes before serving

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Use nutmeg sparingly
*Fresh tarragon will be better than dried tarragon
*Placing a very hot pan in under the quiche will give it greater volume
*Try making quiches with [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sautéed]] [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]s, sautéed [[Cookbook:Broccoli|broccoli]], and shredded sharp [[Cookbook:Cheddar cheese|cheddar cheese]]; feel free to experiment

==Warnings==
*The quiche mixture may drip over the edge of the pie crust while cooking; place it on a cookie sheet or place foil on the oven rack below it
*The quiche will continue to cook after it is removed from the oven; be careful not to overcook it or cut it before it has had a chance to set
*[[Cookbook:Half and Half|Half-and-half]] (cream with approximately 12% fat) can be substituted for regular cream to make this dish less fattening; however, be cautious of using milk because low-fat dairy products curdle more easily

==Warnings==
* Don't eat the dried, small red chili peppers unless you like spicy-hot foods. They are mainly used to season the pot and are not usually eaten.
* Use care in handling the raw chicken. Wash hands and utensils that come into contact with raw chicken. Don't allow raw chicken or its juices to come into contact with other foods, unless they are to be cooked afterwards.

'''Peanut Brittle''' is a sugar based hard candy, with peanuts embedded in it. 
 
==Ingredients==
* 1 cup granulated white sugar
* 1/2 cup light corn syrup
* 1/4 teaspoon salt (omit if using salted peanuts)
* 1/4 cup water
* 1 cup shelled peanuts - raw (Roasted may be used. See Notes below.)
* 2 tablespoons butter, softened
* 1 teaspoon baking soda (Optional. See Notes below.)

==Procedure==
#Grease a 9&quot; x 12&quot; cookie sheet. Set aside until needed.
#Over medium heat, in a heavy 2-qt saucepan, bring the sugar, corn syrup, salt, and water to a boil. 
#Stir until sugar is dissolved.
#Stir in peanuts. (Roasted peanuts can be added at a later stage of cooking to prevent burning.)
#Attach a candy thermometer to pan with tip in sugar mixture.
#Keep stirring and cooking until temperature reaches 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
#Remove from heat.
#Stir in butter and baking soda.
#Pour mixture onto cookie sheet.
#Using a fork or wooden spoon, spread the mixture evenly across the entire surface of the 9&quot; x 12&quot; cookie sheet.
#Allow to cool to room temperature.
#Break peanut brittle into bite size pieces.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Baking soda adds an &quot;easier bite&quot; to the peanut brittle, causing it to break when less force is applied. It also causes the sugar base around the peanuts to be opaque. It does this by &quot;foaming up&quot; and introducing small bubbles in the sugar syrup. If you desire a clearer almost transparent sugar base around the peanuts and a &quot;harder bite&quot;, reduce or omit the baking soda.
*If you use roasted peanuts instead of raw, be careful not heat the mixture above 300-degrees F. or the peanuts may taste burned. Roasted peanuts can also be added at the end of cooking to prevent burning.
*If you use salted peanuts, omit the salt in the recipe.
*See also [[Cookbook:Microwave Peanut Brittle|Microwave Peanut Brittle]]

==Warnings==
*Be very careful while working with boiling sugar mixtures, as they can cause severe burns.

'''Kinpira''' is a [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japanese]] cooking term that roughly translates to ''[[Cookbook:Sautéing|sauté]] and [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]]''. The aim is to cook root vegetables such as carrots and [[Cookbook:Burdock|burdock root]] in a minimum amount of water so that they end up tenderly cooked and with none of their flavour or nutritional value lost into discarded cooking water.

==Ingredients==
*250g (½lb) [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]]s, [[Cookbook:Julienne|julienne]]
*1 Tbs [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]], preferably [[Cookbook:Sesame Oil|sesame oil]]
*[[Cookbook:Water|water]]
*[[Cookbook:Tamari|Tamari]] or [[Cookbook:shoyu|shoyu]] ([[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]), to taste

==Procedure==
# cut the carrots into thin matchstick pieces (sen-giri, or julienne)
# pour a small amount of oil into a [[Cookbook:saucepan|saucepan]] and sauté the carrot pieces for two to three minutes
# add only enough water to half-cover the carrot pieces
# place the lid on the pot and let the carrots simmer on medium-low heat
# towards the end of the cooking process when most of the cooking liquid has been absorbed, add a little tamari or shoyu to enhance flavour

'''Chicken Fried Steak''' is a hearty food dish in the southern USA. The dish is commonly served with mashed potatoes smothered in chicken fried steak gravy. 

Chicken Fried Steak is, simply, a cut of steak (usually cheap round steak)pounded until tender and then breaded like you would bread chicken, and fried in oil. Milk, salt, and pepper are added to the grease drippings and used to make a thick gravy, which is generously poured over the steak and, usually, mashed potatoes. Many people think the gravy makes the steak!

==Ingredients==
*1 cup of [[Cookbook:white flour|white flour]]
*1 tsp of [[Cookbook:pepper|pepper]]
*1/2 tsp of [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
*2 [[Cookbook:egg|egg]]s
*[[Cookbook:milk|milk]]
*[[Cookbook:steak|steak]]
*[[Cookbook:potato|potato]]es

==Procedure==

#Pour cooking oil in pan (NOT olive oil!).
#Preheat pan at middle setting.
#*Wet hand, drip 1 drop of water in pan to test the heat. If it sizzles, it's hot enough. Not too much water though or it may sizzle so much you get hot grease on you!
#Mix 1 cup of white flour with 1 tsp of pepper and 1/2 tsp of salt.
#Beat eggs with milk in bowl.
#Dip tenderized round steak into egg/milk mixture and make sure both sides are drenched with egg mixture.
#Dip steak into flour mix thoroughly on both sides.
#When the pan is hot enough, put steak in pan.
#Fry until golden brown on bottom, and flip.
#Fry until golden brown on the other side.
#Remove steak(s) from pan.
#Pour milk into pan slowly, while stirring the grease and drippings.
#*Don't let the gravy get too thick.
#Add salt and pepper into pan, to taste.
#Pour generously over steak and mashed potatoes.

==Notes, tips, and variations==

==Warnings==
* When heating the pan in step 2.  Wet hand, drip 1 drop of water in pan to test the heat. If it sizzles, it's hot enough. Not too much water though or it may sizzle so much you get hot grease on you!
*Don't let the gravy get too thick.

'''Mead''' is a fermented alcoholic beverage made of honey, water, and yeast. It is sometimes known as &quot;honey wine&quot; (for obvious reasons) and is generally pronounced &quot;meed&quot; (IPA: /miːd/), though South Africans usually pronounce it &quot;med&quot;, to rhyme with &quot;red&quot; (IPA: /mɛd/).

Mead can have a wide range of flavors, depending on the source of the honey, additives including fruit and spices, the yeast employed during fermentation, and aging procedure. Mead can be difficult to find commercially, though some producers have been successful marketing it.

Many meads retain some measure of the sweetness of the original honey, and some can even be considered as dessert wines. Drier meads are also available, and some producers offer sparkling meads, which (like champagne) can make for a delightful celebratory toast.

A mead that also contains spices (like cloves, cinnamon or nutmeg) or herbs (such as oregano or even lavender or chamomile) is called ''metheglin''. A mead that contains fruit (such as strawberry, blackcurrant or even rose-hips) is called ''melomel'' and was also used as a delicious way to store summer produce for the winter. Mulled mead is a popular winter holiday drink, where mead is flavoured with spices and warmed, traditionally by having a hot poker plunged into it. ''Hippocras'' is spiced grape wine sweetened with honey. A grape-based wine with added honey is called a ''pyment''. ''Cyser'' is made with apple juice and honey; ''braggot'' or ''bracket'' is made with malted barley and honey.

Production of mead for private consumption should be considered to be submitted to the same regulations as the production of [[Cookbook:Wine|grape wine]]. See also the numerous warnings on the [[Cookbook:Alcoholic_Drink#Warnings|alcoholic drink]] page.

==Equipment==
[[Image:Homebrew Fermenter.jpg|right|thumb|Fermenter with airlock fitted]]
Mead is made in a fermentation vessel, preferably a glass [[w:Carboy|carboy]], with an [[w:Airlock|airlock]] and a rubber bung. These items can usually be found at a brewer's supply store. The ingredients of mead are honey, filtered water, and yeast. Fruit or spices are optional.

Mead should be made in sanitized equipment to ensure food safety. Potassium metabisulphite is a common sanitizing agent. Those who are allergic to sulphites can use other sanitizing methods. Failure to remove all traces of this chemical from the equipment may result in poisonous or otherwise undrinkable mead.

==Ingredients==

*3 [[Cookbook:Pound|pounds]] of [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]] per [[Cookbook:Gallon|gallon]] (U.S.). (For example, 15 pounds of honey are used with a 5 gallon (U.S.) carboy.)
*1 pound of [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]]. (optional)
*1 packet of dry winemaker's [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]] (Lalvin EC1118, K1V1116 or similar) as well as yeast nutrient.

==Procedure==

Some mead makers prefer to create a starter culture by preparing a mixture of one cup of room temperature sanitized fruit juice and the freeze dried winemaking yeast and placing it into a smaller one [[Cookbook:Quart|quart]] sanitized container fitted with a rubber stopper and airlock for a day or two until the mixture is bubbling. This container is kept at room temperature out of direct sunlight. This starter culture will cause the fermentation below to begin with vigor and may prevent the mead from failing to ferment.

Honey is slowly added to a large pot half-full with water while heating. There is a common disagreement among mead makers as to whether you should boil the honey or not; mead makers have had success with either method. Boiling will alter the flavor, but will enhance the clarity of the finished mead. As the mead is heated over medium heat, it will nearly boil after the honey has been completely dissolved.

After a time of heating the honey (which helps it dissolve and can also pasteurize it), the mixture is cooled to between (170°F/76°C) and (140°F/60°C) and the raisins are added. The mixture continues to cool, then is transferred to the [[Wikipedia:carboy|carboy]]. Once it has cooled to room temperature (68°F/20°C), yeast which has been rehydrated is added to the honey/water mixture (must) and the airlock is put on. After being placed in a cool (68°F/20°C), dark place for a few hours or a day, the airlock should start to allow bubbles to escape. This is waste carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and shows that the yeast is processing the sugar into alcohol. The raisins rise to the surface of the fermenting mixture. If they block the airlock, the mead maker will have to rack. Stirring or agitating the mixture is avoided, as it may cause the liquid to rise up and spill out of the airlock.

After a four to six week period the mead maker may want to [[Cookbook:Racking|rack]] the mead into a second sanitized carboy. An airlock is not necessary during primary (aerobic) fermentation. This racking will clear out the lees and allow the mead to clear faster. The mead is siphoned into the second carboy via a sanitized tube, usually filled it with sterile water to start the siphon. The mead is siphoned carefully to avoid splashing as excess oxygen at this point may cause an unpleasant taste in the final product. An airlock is placed on the second carboy. It is imperative that sterile conditions be maintained while the carboys are open to avoid infection. The mead is racked in another 3 months or when all signs of fermentation have stopped (usually when the airlock doesn't produce any bubbles for a long period of time&amp;mdash;typically over 30 seconds between bubbles) and your mead has cleared. Excessive racking will promote oxidation, resulting in an undrinkable mead. The carboy is clear enough when it is possible to read a newspaper through it. The mead will then need to age, usually one year, and anywhere up five or more. Bulk aging can be done done in a tertiary carboy, but bottle aging is also common.

Then next step is to bottle the mead. Mead is generally sealed in sanitized bottles using airtight caps or quality corks. If the fermentation is not complete, pressure will build up inside the sealed bottles and cause them to explode. Mead is generally aged for at least 6 months in the bottle before drinking.

'''Bigos''' is considered the Polish national dish by many. For more information see [[w:Bigos|wikipedia's article on Bigos]].

== Ingredients ==
: 2.5 kg fresh [[Cookbook:cabbage|cabbage]]
: 2 kg fermented cabbage ([[Cookbook:sauerkraut|sauerkraut]])
: 500 g [[Cookbook:pork|pork]] or [[Cookbook:venison|venison]]
: 250 g [[Cookbook:sausage|sausage]]
: 250 g [[Cookbook:bacon|bacon]]
: fresh or dried [[Cookbook:mushroom|mushroom]]s
: whole [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]], [[Cookbook:salt|salt]], [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaf]]

== Procedure ==
#Chop the cabbage, add pepper and salt, a part of the mushrooms and bay leaf, and cook until soft (about 2-3 hours).
#Chop the bacon and let it melt in a frying pan. 
#Fry the chopped meat and sausage in the bacon grease. 
#If necessary, drain excess water from the stewed cabbage and add the fried meat, bacon, and sausage along with the grease out of the pan. Stew everything as long as possible - the longer, the better (sometimes it is done for 3 hours a day in 3 following days, or even longer). 
#When ready, the dish should be a thick mash that does not &quot;leak&quot; water on the plate; it should be mildly sour and have a strong flavour of smoked bacon.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
There are countless variations of this basic recipe. According to some, the amount of meat should be equal to the amount of cabbage; others prefer to use only fermented cabbage as in German sauerkraut.

A very particular feature of this dish is that it can be safely stored even for a few days without refrigerating. This is why bigos used to be a common soldiers' dish.

'''Ossobuco''' (Italian for 'holed bone'), in English often spelled 'osso buco' or 'osso bucco', is a Milanese specialty of veal shanks cooked in meat broth and flavored with white wine. Slowly braised, this relatively tough, yet flavorful cut of meat becomes meltingly tender, and the connective tissues and marrow dissolve into the sauce, making it rich and creamy. 

The shank is a relatively cheap cut of veal which is readily available in most good supermarkets and butcher shops. Look for meaty hind-shanks cut from the top of the thigh with a high proportion of meat-to-bone; each piece should be about 5&quot; across and 1&quot; to 1½&quot; thick.

Traditionally, ossobuco is made without tomatoes (these being unknown in Milan until the late 19th century). However, the traditional version, prepared with cinnamon, allspice, bay leaf and gremolata called ''in bianco'', has by and large been replaced with the newer version which includes tomatoes and the 'holy trinity' of Italian cooking: carrot, celery and onion, flavoured with a bouquet garni and without gremolata (although 'hybrid' versions exist which include both tomato and gremolata). It should be noted that while the traditional combination with risotto alla milanese is perfect for the former version (for which is was intended), the modern-day version with tomato, which is both moister and bolder in flavour and does not combine well with saffron, is better served with polenta. The following recipe is for a 'modern' version.

== Ingredients ==
* 4 slices [[Cookbook:Veal|veal]] hind shank, about 1&quot; to 1½&quot; (2.5cm to 4cm) thick
* 1 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], chopped fine
* 3 ribs [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]] with leaves, chopped fine
* 1 medium [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]], chopped fine
* 2 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], [[Cookbook:Mincing|minced]]
* 3 tbs. [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* 4 tbs. [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]]
* 1 cup (240ml) dry white [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]] or white [[Cookbook:Vermouth|vermouth]]
* 2 cups (about 480ml) meat [[Cookbook:Stock|broth]]
* 3 tbs. [[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomato paste]]
* 6 [[Cookbook:Anchovy|anchovy]] fillets, mashed
* ½ tsp. dried [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]]
* 2-3 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaves]]
* 2 strips [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]] peel
* kosher [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* fresh ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]

== Procedure ==
# Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
# If the butcher has not done so, tie the shanks around the middle with kitchen twine; this will keep them from falling apart during cooking.
# Choose a heavy, covered roasting pan or Dutch oven which will just accommodate the veal shanks in one layer. Put the butter, 2 tablespoons of the oil, the onions, celery and carrots in the pan and sauté over medium heat until the vegetables have wilted, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic and lemon peel and sauté until they're fragrant, about 2 minutes more. Remove from the heat.
# Meanwhile, heat the remaining oil in a skillet until it is near the smoking point. Lightly flour the veal shanks and slip them into the oil. Richly brown the shanks on both of the cut sides, then place them in the roasting pan on top of the vegetables.
# Place the wine in the skillet and boil until reduced by one-half, scraping up any brown residue. Pour this over the veal shanks.
# Heat the beef broth to a boil in the skillet, whisking in the tomato paste and anchovies. Add this to the veal shanks, along with the herbs, several grindings of pepper, and a large pinch of salt. The liquid should cover ¾ of the shanks. If not, add extra water.
# Bring the pot to a simmer, cover, and place in the oven. Cook for approximately 2 hours, turning and basting the shanks every ½ hour. If you notice that the cooking liquids have nearly evaporated, add hot water, about ½ cup at a time. The veal is done when it is fork tender and falling from the bone.
# Transfer the shanks to a platter, remove the strings, and cover to keep warm. If the sauce seems watery, as is probable, place the pan on the stove top over high heat and reduce the cooking liquid until the sauce has a thick, creamy consistency. Pour the sauce over the shanks and serve.

== Notes ==
* The recipe calls for anchovies, which enrich the finished sauce without adding a &quot;fishy&quot; flavor: don't omit them, even should you not be fond of anchovies.
* Traditionally, the cooking sauce is finished with a mixture of garlic, lemon zest and parsley called ''Gremolata.'' It adds a burst of freshness to the finished dish and is highly recommended. Gremolata consists of the grated zest of one lemon, one finely minced clove of garlic, and one tablespoon of finely chopped parsley. Add this mixture to the sauce at the end of the cooking, as it's being reduced.
* Osso buco is almost ''always'' served with [[Cookbook:Risotto|risotto]]&amp;ndash;indeed; it's one of the few examples in Italian cooking where a starch is served with the main course and is a marriage that no man should put asunder. One may, for a change, substitute orzo or acini de pepe cooked in meat broth and finished with butter and [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan cheese]].

'''Tri-colored Autumn Rice Balls''' (San-Shoku Ohagi)

Ohagi is a simple a tea sweet, which was at one time served during the autumn equinox celebration.  The name comes from a type of bush clover that only blooms in the fall.  Serve these rice balls with your finest cup of tea.

==Ingredients==
* 3 cups prepared [[Cookbook:Steamed Sweet Rice|Steamed Sweet Rice]]
*1/4 cup toasted black sesame seeds, lightly crushed
*1 tablespoon sugar
*1 cup smooth Japanese bean paste (koshi-an), chilled
*1/2 cup roasted soybean powder (kinako) or toasted ground pecans.  

==Procedure==
Mix sesame seeds and sugar in a small bowl.  Moisten your hands with water and divide warm rice into 12 equal portions.  Shape 4 portions into balls.  Moisten a clean dish towel and squeeze dry.  Place 2 1/2 tablespoons bean paste on towel; pat into 4 inch circle. Place 1 rice ball in centre of bean paste circle and use towel to mould bean paste around the rice ball.  Repeat this 3 more times, using another 1/2 cup of bean paste and the other 3 rice balls.  Place these on a nice serving tray.  Flatten the remaining eight rice portions.  Form the remaining bean paste into 8 balls (about 2 teaspoons per ball).  Place a bean paste ball in the centre of each piece of flattened rice and shape the rice around it.  Mould these stuffed rice balls into oval shapes.  Roll 4 ovals in the sesame-sugar mixture.  Roll the other 4 balls in the roasted soybean powder.  Add these to the serving tray.  Makes six servings of 2 rice balls each.

A vegan cheese that mainly consists of potato, oil and soy.

==Ingredients==

[[Image:Bfast2005_vegan_cheese_2.jpg|frame|right|Vegan cheese]]

*[[Cookbook:mashed potatoes|mashed potatoes]] (5 large, hard boiling [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoe]]s, 750g - 1kg) (or potato starch?)
*[[Cookbook:corn flour|corn flour]] (or [[Cookbook:breading|breading]] mixture, [[:de:w:Paniermehl|Paniermehl]])
*[[Cookbook:soy sauce|soy sauce]] (20ml) or [[Cookbook:yeast extract|yeast extract]]
*optional:
**[[Cookbook:salt|salt]] or [[Cookbook:celery salt|celery salt]]
**[[Cookbook:bear's garlic|bear's garlic]], [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic]], any other [[Cookbook:herbs|herbs]], e.g. [[Cookbook:paprika|paprika]], [[Cookbook:thyme|thyme]], [[Cookbook:rosemary|rosemary]], [[Cookbook:cumin|cumin]], [[Cookbook:oregano|oregano]] and [[Cookbook:savory|savory]]
**[[Cookbook:onion|onion]]s
**seasoning mix (corn flour, salt, [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili]], onion, garlic, paprika, [[Cookbook:MSG|sodium glutamate]]), or Mexican [[Cookbook:Taco Seasoning Mix|Taco Seasoning Mix]]
**seasoning mix &quot;Chili&quot; (1-3g), e.g.: Chilies, [[Cookbook:orange zest|orange peelings]], [[Cookbook:sesame|sesame]], paprika, traces: [[Cookbook:celery|celery]] and [[Cookbook:mustard|mustard]].
**[[Cookbook:vegetable stock|vegetable stock]] (1-5g) (salt, yeast extract, corn flour, [[Cookbook:sun flower oil|sun flower oil]], onions, [[Cookbook:carrot|carrot]]s, spices, [[Cookbook:parsley|parsley]]) (commercially available)
**[[Cookbook:unrefined sugar|unrefined sugar]] (or [[Cookbook:sugar|sugar]] not refined using the char method)
**[[Cookbook:pepper|pepper]]
**[[Cookbook:rice|rice]]
**[[Cookbook:popcorn|popcorn]]
**[[Cookbook:rapeseed oil|rapeseed oil]] or other [[Cookbook:vegetable oil|vegetable oil]] (20ml)
**[[Cookbook:vinegar|vinegar]] (10ml)
**[[Cookbook:agar|agar]] (that wasn't very successful, it didn't change consistency much)

==Procedure==
#[[Cookbook:Boil|Boil]] potatoes until they are not quite done. If the potatoes are not completely done the resulting substance may be sliceable, although it will be easy to spread anyway.
#Take the mashed potatoes and add soy sauce and yeast extract generously and mix it with some margarine and/or some rapeseed oil. Some corn flour, breading mixture or wheat flour help to make the substance drier and, in case of corn flour, add significantly to the taste. (soy flour is unsuitable here due to its taste). A small amount of lecithin powder can be added as an [[Cookbook:emulgator|emulgator]] but is not really necessary. It it's healthy and, being hydrophilic and lipophilic, it binds together the water and the oil.
#Mix the ingredients. The substance should take on the consistency of [[Cookbook:peanut butter|peanut butter]] but have more the color of cheese than anything else.
#The taste isn't yet close to cheese but getting closer. Corn flour, either in a seasoning mix or just plain corn flour gets us closer to cheese now. If you add enough seasoning mix the color will be much closer to peanut butter now but you may opt to leave away the seasoning mix altogether and just add corn flour, separately or with the vegetable stock. Adding cumin is also highly recommended. Another alternative is the Chili season mix, which can also be combined with other spices, for example vegetable stock, sugar and cumin. Vinegar may increase durability in the refrigerator but more than 4 days are not recommended.
#You can add bear's garlic, garlic, onions and/or any herbs you like (e.g. fresh Thyme) to the cheese. A pinch of sugar can add to the taste but may not be compatible with all other spices.
#Fill the substance into a small, round form, to give it the form of a cheddar cheese.

[[Image:Bfast2005_vegan_cheese.jpg|frame|right|Vegan cheese with rice]]

==Variant with rice==

In the variant with rice about half (up to two thirds) of the base substance is replaced by mashed rice. The advantage of mashed rice is that it results in a more cheese like substance, which dries better.

==Variant with vegetable stock==

The variant with vegetable stock can be made with less soy sauce. Mexican Taco Seasoning Mix can be used but is not required, because the vegetable stock is already very spicy. The variant can be combined with rice.

==Variant with vegan cheese sauce==

A dairy free cheese flavor sauce mix can be suitable to acquire a stronger cheese flavor.

==Freezing==

Freezing is not recommended. There was a single case where freezing seemed to even have improved the consistency (making it a bit like tofu) but this lacks reproducibility.

== Best served ==

=== With tomato, basil and garlic ===

Best served slightly heated (e.g. on a [[Cookbook:solar oven|solar oven]]) on [[Cookbook:Ciabatta|ciabatta]] with a splash of warm [[Cookbook:olive oil|olive]] or rapeseed oil, mixed with a mashed clove of garlic and with a slice of [[Cookbook:tomato|tomato]] and a leaf of [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]].

=== With onions and grapes ===

Put the cheese on a slice of bread and sprinkle hackled onions on top. Bake in a [[Cookbook:toaster oven|toaster oven]] or [[Cookbook:grill|grill]] until the onions turn only slightly glassy. [[Cookbook:Grapes|Grapes]] cut in halves make a good topping and complement the taste.

'''Idli''' is a round, fluffy bread roughly eight centimetres in diameter. Idli is made from ground rice or rice flour mixed with ground urad dal, salt, methi (fenugreek seeds) and water. The mixture is allowed to [[Cookbook:Fermentation|ferment]] prior to being steamed in an idli steamer. They are traditional to Southern India and are most often eaten with [[Cookbook:Sambar|sambar]].

==Ingredients==

* 1½ cups [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Urad Bean|white urad dal]] (black gram, skinless)
* 2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Salt|non-iodised salt]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Fenugreek|fenugreek seeds]] (methi)
* 4 cups [[Cookbook:Water|water]] for soaking rice and urad dal
* 2 cups [[Cookbook:Water|chlorine-free water]] for fermenting (see note)
* optional: fermentation starter (see note)

==Procedure==

===Making the Batter===
# Soak the rice and urad dal in separate bowls for eight hours. You will need about twice as much water in the bowl as urad dal, as it expands as it soaks up water.
# Drain the rice and urad dal, discard water (good for watering plants).
# Grind the urad dal to a fine paste with about 1 cup of chlorine-free water.
# Grind the rice to a paste with about 1 cup of chlorine-free water, less if you can. Grind coarsely if the batter will only be used for idli, but grind finely if it will later be used for [[Cookbook:Dosa|dosa]].
# Mix the rice and urad dal pastes together well, with salt and methi. 
# Optional: add fermentation starter and mix well (see note).
# Set aside somewhere warm to ferment for 12-24 hours (see note).

[[Image:Idli pan.png|right|thumb|An idli pan]]
===Making the Idli===

# Grease one or more [[Cookbook:Idli Pan|idli pans]] well with [[Cookbook:Ghee|ghee]] or [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]].
# Spoon the batter into the round indentations of the idli pans.
# Steam for 10 minutes in a steamer, 20 minutes if using brown rice.
# Remove idli from pans with a sharp knife or thin [[Cookbook:Spatula|spatula]].

==Notes, tips, and variations==
Idli is a very temperamental creature: it is not easy to get soft fluffy idlis. These tips may help.

# A traditional stone grinder is recommended for making idlis. The modern high speed mixer with metal blades won't work as well, but a blender will do a reasonable job.
# Idli is made of black lentil and rice. The southern parts of India use boiled rice, while the rest uses raw rice. It depends on your taste. The black lentil should be the full, round variety. Avoid broken dal.
# The ratio of black lentil to rice should not exceed 1:2 by volume.  If you have good quality dal, you can stretch this ratio by increasing the quantity of rice. 
# Soak dal and rice separately for at least three hours, preferably eight. You can add half a teaspoon of fenugreek (methi) seeds to the dal for a good twist.
# The rice is typically long grain white rice, but brown rice works well also and adds flavour, colour, and more nutrition. Brown rice needs to be soaked at least eight hours.
# Use plenty of water for grinding the dal and make it a very smooth paste. But grind the rice coarse and granular.
# Add salt. Don't be afraid of salt - idli needs a lot of it.
# Mix the dal and rice batters thoroughly. It takes more time and energy than you might think. Uneven mixing causes many failures. Mixing them by hand works best!
# A warm temperature is essential for fermentation. 25 to 28 °C (77 - 82.4 °F) will be ideal. If the weather is cold, keep some warm water in a large bowl and immerse the vessel containing the dough. To help maintain the temperature of the warm water bath, cover it with a blanket, or better, use a regulated heater, like a heating pad or  aquarium heater. Even easier, turn on the light in the oven, and use that to keep the batter warm.
# Allow at least 8 hours to ferment. If you don't see tiny bubbles the next morning, the dough will not rise and you have to start all over again. 
# If you can't get it to ferment by itself, try a good fermentation starter like a teaspoonful of [[Cookbook:Kefir|kefir]]. Just bread yeast will not make for good flavour, as bacteria are needed also.
# Use chlorine-free water when grinding, as this will be the water that the batter will have in it when fermenting. Tap water will work, but will inhibit the ferment a little. Most modern water filters remove both [[w:Chlorine|chlorine]] and [[w:Chloramine|chloramine]].
# In the morning, gently scoop the top layer of the batter and steam it. DO NOT stir or otherwise break the batter. The trapped bubbles should not escape; they are necessary for sponginess.
# Steam the idlis in the idli pan. An open stove is preferable over microwave. The vessel should steam like an old locomotive.
# Steam it for 10 minutes. You know it is done from the characteristic smell. If you are not sure, poke it gently with a spoon and make sure the batter does not stick to the spoon.
# Allow it to cool for a minute. Sprinkle the idlis liberally with [[Cookbook:Sesame Oil|sesame oil]] and eat them with suitable side dishes, such as [[Cookbook:Coconut Chutney|chutni]], [[Cookbook:Sambar|sambaar]] and idli powder.
# Leftover batter that has lost its froth can still be used to make [[Cookbook:dosa|dosa]].

===Ready-made idli batter===

Some Indian groceries in the USA (and elsewhere, presumably) may stock fresh ready-to-cook idli batter. Balaji Idli Mix by Sri Sai Foods of Somerville, NJ is a fresh batter marked with a freshness date that is found in the refrigerated section. Simply spoon the batter into idli pans well brushed with ghee, and steam. This produces a very good idli, light and fluffy with a characteristic tangy flavor.

Idli pans are inexpensive and available in the same Indian grocery stores.

'''Pennsylvania Pot Pie''' is a Pennsylvania Dutch soup, with meat, vegetables, and squares of pie crust.

==Ingredients==
Dumplings/noodles:
* 2 1/2 c [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1 t [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 t ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* 1 c [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]]
* 1/3 c plus 1 T cold water
Soup:
* 2 quarts water
* 1 can [[Cookbook:Green Bean|green beans]]
* 1 to 3 lb. stewing [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]]
* salt and pepper to taste

==Procedure==
#Boil chicken in water until tender.
#Meanwhile, prepare noodle dough following the first 5 steps of [[Cookbook:Flaky Pie Crust|Flaky Pie Crust]] procedure, from the ingredients above.  ''Note: [[Cookbook:Sugar|Sugar]] and [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] are replaced with pepper and shortening, respectively.''
#On a floured board, roll dough about twice as thick as ordinary pie crust (about a 9&quot; circle or 8&quot; x 10&quot; rectangle).
#Cut dough into roughly 2&quot; squares.
#Remove chicken from broth.  Shred chicken, discarding bones and skin.
#Stir pot pie squares into boiling broth a few at a time, being careful not to let them stick together.  Simmer 6 minutes.
#Add chicken and green beans.  Simmer for 10 to 15 minutes.
#Remove from heat.  Let stand 5 minutes before serving.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Note: Pot pie squares will dissolve into the broth around the edges, but remain relatively firm in their centers.  This is normal.
*A range of fresh vegetables including fresh green beans, cubed [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], finely diced [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]], [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], etc. can be added after the chicken if cooking times are planned carefully.
*Cooked chicken or [[Cookbook:Turkey|turkey]], or bite-sized pieces of [[Cookbook:Ham|ham]] can be substituted for the raw chicken.  In this case, substitute chicken [[Cookbook:Broth|broth]] for water.

&quot;A national dish of Scotland, composed of a forcemeat of the heart, liver and lungs of a sheep mixed with oatmeal, well seasoned and put into bags made from the paunch of the sheep. The haggis is then boiled for 2-3 hours and left to get cold. When required for use it is simmered again for about an hour and is traditionally served with mashed turnips, potatoes and whisky.&quot; &lt;cite&gt;from www.tedcancook.com/terms1.htm&lt;/cite&gt;

{{wikipedia|Haggis}}

The accompaniments, &quot;neeps and tatties&quot;, refer to mashed [[Cookbook:Swede|swede]] or [[Cookbook:Turnip|turnip]], and [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] (in this context, mashed.)

In fish and chip shops, a long, sausage-shaped haggis is often available deep-fried in batter with chips.

==Recipe==
'''Major Ingredients'''
*1 pound beef heart, cut into 2-inch-wide strips. 
*1 pound beef liver. 
*1/2 pound lamb stew meat, cut in 1-inch cubes. 
*1 1/2 cups peeled and finely chopped yellow onion. 
*4 tablespoons Scots whisky.
*1 tablespoon of Egg nog 
*2 cups oatmeal, toasted on a cookie sheet in a 375F oven for 10 minutes). 

'''Seasonings'''
*2 teaspoons salt. 
*1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper. 
*1 teaspoon dried thyme, whole. 
*1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary. 
*1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg. 

'''Casing'''
*3 beef CAPS (Talk to a sausage shop about these). 
*1 cup distilled white vinegar. 
*1/2 tablespoon salt for soaking. 

== Procedure ==
# Place the beef heart in a 4-quart covered pot and just cover with cold water. Simmer, covered, for 1 hour and 10 minutes.
# Add the beef liver and lamb stew meat, and cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Remove the contents of the pot and cool. Reserve 1 cup of the liquid. Grind everything coarsely.
# In a large bowl mix all of the ingredients, except for the beef caps, vinegar, and salt for soaking. Mix well and set aside.
# Rinse the beef caps in cold water. Turn them inside out and soak them in 2 quarts of cold water with the salt and vinegar for 1/2 hour. Drain them and rinse very well, inside and out.
# Divide the meat mixture into three parts. Fill the beef caps with the meat mixture and tie the ends off with string. Two will have to be tied on just one end, but the third piece will be tied on both ends. Prick the Haggis all over with corn holders or a sharp fork. Place in a steamer and steam for 1 hour and 20 minutes.

Serve the Haggis, sliced, with beef or lamb gravy.

'''Aloo gobi''' is an [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] [[Cookbook:Curry powder|curry]]. Aloo means [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]] and Gobi means [[Cookbook:Cauliflower|cauliflower]]. This dish has a prominent role in the movie ''[[Wikipedia:Bend It Like Beckham|Bend It Like Beckham]]''. The DVD contains a featurette titled ''How to cook Aloo gobi'', however, the recipe given differs from the following one and the one in the external link below, demonstrating the variety of ways the dish can be prepared. Also, sometimes aloo gobi is made without the tomato.

==Ingredients==
* 750 [[Cookbook:Gram|g]] [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], [[Cookbook:Dice|diced]] or [[Cookbook:Purée|puréed]]
* 1 big [[Cookbook:Cauliflower|cauliflower]] cut into chunks

* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin seeds]]
* 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Turmeric|curcuma]] (turmeric)
* 2 tablespoon ground [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]]
* 1-2 tablespoon ground [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chilli]]
* 2-4 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Garam Masala|garam masala]]
* 1 sprig of [[Cookbook:Mint|mint]]

==Procedure==
# Heat the ghee/oil in frying pan, wok or karahi (an Indian utensil specially used for frying purposes)
# Add jeera (cumin seeds) and wait until they turn a light brown color.
# Add the spices (except for garam masala) and the tomatoes.
# When the mixture turns oily, add the vegetables.
# Roast the cauliflower and the potatoes until they turn soft. Stir occasionally.
# Add the garam masala, mint and lemon juice.

'''READ THIS ALSO:'''Adapted from http://alfredo.octavio.net/soft_drink_formula.pdf, [http://66.102.7.104/search?q=cache:ZJ5HL71eALoJ:alfredo.octavio.net/soft_drink_formula.pdf+open+cola&amp;hl=en&amp;start=3 View as HTML with Google]

== Background ==
OpenCola is  unique in that the instructions for making it are freely available and modifiable. Anybody can make the drink, and anyone can modify and improve on the recipe as long as they, too, license their recipe under the GNU General Public License. The legal grounds for this are dubious however, as recipes are exempted from copyright as they are techniques, not artworks.

Although originally intended as a promotional tool to explain free software/open source software, the drink took on a life of its own and 150,000 cans were sold. The Toronto-based company Opencola founded by Grad Conn, Cory Doctorow and John Henson became better known for the drink than the software it was supposed to promote. Laird Brown, the company's senior strategist, attributes its success to a widespread mistrust of big corporations and the &quot;proprietary nature of almost everything.&quot;

== Flavoring Formula ==
* 10.0 g Food Grade Gum Arabic &lt;I&gt;(Important: Do NOT use Art Grade Gum Arabic!)&lt;/I&gt;
* 3.50 mL Orange oil
* 3.00 mL Water
* 2.75 mL Lime oil
* 1.25 mL Cassia oil
* 1.00 mL Lemon oil
* 1.00 mL Nutmeg oil
* 0.25 mL Coriander oil
* 0.25 mL Neroli oil
* 0.25 mL Lavender oil

== Concentrate Formula==
* 2.36 kg plain granulated White Table Sugar
* 2.28 L Water
* 30.0 mL Caramel color
* 3.50 tsp. 75% Phosphoric acid or Citric acid
* 2.00 tsp. Flavoring Formula
* 0.50 tsp. Caffeine (optional)

== Preparation ==

'''Flavoring:'''&lt;br /&gt;
Mix oils together in a cup. Add food-grade gum arabic, mix with a spoon. Add water and mix well. A mixer may be used for this step, mixing for 4-5 minutes. You can also transfer to a blender for this step. The mix can be kept in a sealed glass 
jar in the fridge or at room temperature.
Please note that this mixture will separate. The gum arabic is essential to this part of the recipe, as you are mixing 
oil and water.
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Syrup:'''&lt;br /&gt;
In a one gallon container, take 5 mls of 
the Flavoring Formula, add the 75% phosphoric or citric acid. Add the water, then the sugar. While mixing, add the 
caffeine, if desired. Make sure the caffeine is completely dissolved. Then add the caramel color. Mix thoroughly.
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Cola:'''&lt;br /&gt;
To finish drink, take one part syrup and add 5 parts carbonated water.

'''Fried okra''' means summer in the South. A quick mid-day meal; a side-dish at the evening meal -- easy to make and always tasty.

For 1 person

# Wash and drain a couple of handfuls of fresh [[Cookbook:Okra|okra]].
# Cut each okra into three or four slices, about 3/4 to one inch long. Discard the stem.
# Soak the okra in buttermilk or plain milk, drain, then dredge in seasoned flour &amp; corn meal. A quick way to do this is to put a half cup of flour and a cup of corn meal in a plastic bag, add the spices you like (salt, pepper, cayenne, cumin, thyme, etc), put in the okra and shake.
# Let the okra rest a few minutes. If any pieces look soggy, dredge them again in a flour/corn meal mix.
# Fry the okra in hot oil. They're done in 2-3 minutes.
# Drain, and enjoy!

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Salad Recipes|Salad Recipes]] 

'''Vinaigrette''' (from [[French]] ''vinaigre'', vinegar) is an emulsion of [[Cookbook:vinegar|vinegar]] and [[Cookbook:oil|oil]]. It is one of the most basic salad dressings.

==Ingredients==
* 1 clove of garlic, smashed
* 2 tablespoons vinegar
* 1 teaspoon mustard
* 6 tablespoons oil (vegetable, extra virgin olive, almond, hazlenut, etc.)
* salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
* herbs to taste

==Procedure==
# Mix garlic, salt, mustard and vinegar until smooth.
# Add oil and mix until smooth.
# Add pepper and herbs to taste.
# Let stand; the longer the herbs and mustard soak in the oil, the better-blended the flavor will be.   You may need to quickly remix the vinaigrette just before dressing the salad if the oil and vinegar have separated while standing.

==Notes, tips and variations==

* The classical ratio of vinegar to oil is 1:3. Some recipes, however, suggest a ratio as low as 1:5.
* It is important to mix the mustard and vinegar first, then add the oil.  This helps the emulsion hold better, resulting in a smooth vinaigrette that is slow to separate out.   Adding the oil in a stream and mixing as it is added helps even more.
* Use a pleasantly flavored vinegar such as balsamic vinegar or red wine vinegar.
* Mustard powder may be used instead of regular mustard.
* Instead of the garlic, a similar amount of very finely diced shallot may be used.
* Toss the dressing with the salad just before serving.  Greens that have been dressed wilt and become unappetizing within a few minutes.
* Different oils can be used for different flavors. Some suggest the use of vegetable oil, but this tends to add little in the way of flavor and most would find it unsuibtable. Extra virgin olive oil is always a good choice, but nearly any plant oil can be used and experimentation is always good.

In mixing bowl with electric mixer, beat yams (or [[Cookbook:Sweet Potato|sweet potatoes]]).  Add in remaining main ingredients, beating until mixture is light and fluffy.  Butter a 12&quot; porcelain quiche dish or a shallow 2 quart casserole dish (7&quot;x11&quot;).  Pour in yam mixture, smoothing top evenly.  

Make praline topping by mixing all ingredients together in small bowl.  Spread evenly over the yams.  May be refrigerated covered overnight.  Bake at 350 degrees for 45-50 minutes or until golden brown and bubbly.  Remove from oven and let stand ten minutes before serving.

Serves 10-12.

[[Image:WheatGrass.jpg|thumb|right|280px|One week old wheat grass]]

'''Wheat grass juice''' is the extracted juice from young (5 - 10 inch) [[Cookbook:Wheat|wheat]] plants. The juice is touted for many health benefits due to its high concentrations of Chlorophyll, enzymes, vitamins (especially B's) and minerals. Another benefit of drinking wheat grass juice is a significant energy ''buzz'', due to the very high concentrations of B vitamins, that lasts several hours.  

A typical portion is two fluid ounces, requiring the juicing of 1/3 to 1 square foot of wheat grass. The juice has a pungent, sweet odor/taste which is an [[Cookbook:acquired taste|acquired taste]]. It may be drunk straight, or mixed with other juices, such as carrot or apple.

Wheatgrass juice should always be consumed immediately after juicing.

==Materials==
* 1 - 2 cups Wheat berries
* 1 Tray (cafeteria type, to grow shoots on)
* 2 cups potting soil
* Large jar

[[Image:WheatGrassJuicing.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Wheat grass juice from a manual juicer.]]

==Growing==
* Soak the wheat berries overnight
* Drain, cover with damp paper towel allow a day or so to sprout (still in the large jar)
* Spread the potting soil on the tray, and then the sprouts.
* Keep watered.
* The sprouts should be ready for use in about a week

==Juicing==
*Use an electric or manual juicer
*Drink two to four ounces straight, or mixed with the juice of your choice.

==Ingredients==
* 1 [[Cookbook:Pound|lb.]] dried [[Cookbook:black bean|black bean]]s 
* 10 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:water|water]]
* 1 large [[Cookbook:bell pepper|green pepper]] (cut in half, seeds &amp; stem removed) 
* 1/3 cup [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* 1 large [[Cookbook:onion|onion]], chopped
* 4 cloves of [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic]], smashed and chopped
* 1 large [[Cookbook:green pepper|green pepper]] (seeds &amp; stem removed, then chopped)
* 4 teaspoons [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
* 1/2 teaspoon [[Cookbook:pepper|pepper]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:oregano|oregano]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaf]]
* 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:sugar|sugar]]
* 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:cider vinegar|cider vinegar]]
* 2 tablespoons dry [[Cookbook:white wine|white wine]] (cooking wine or dry sherry is fine)
* 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]

==Procedure==
# The night before you plan to cook, wash the beans and put them in a large pot to soak in the water and green pepper. (the one cut in half) 
# The next day, cook them in the same water until they are softer (a low [[Cookbook:boil|boil]], stirring occasionally, about an hour). 
# In a [[Cookbook:frying pan|frying pan]], heat the oil and [[Cookbook:sauté|sauté]] the chopped onion, garlic, and green pepper (this is called a sofrito) until soft (about 5-10 min.) 
# Take a cup of the soft black beans in some liquid and put in a [[Cookbook:blender|blender]]. Liquefy the beans. Add this to the frying pan and mix the bean liquid with the sofrito. Then, add the contents of the frying pan to the big pot of beans. Add salt, pepper, oregano, bay leaf, and sugar. 
# Boil about another hour, stirring occasionally. Add vinegar and cooking wine. 
# Boil for about another hour to thicken. Add the 2 tablespoons of olive oil and serve.

Note: If the beans are too watery, boil until the right consistency. They keep for about a week in the refrigerator – or they freeze well.

{{recipesummary|Sandwich|1|5-10 minutes|1}}
This sandwich should keep well because it has peanut butter on both pieces of bread, providing a waterproof layer to keep the bread from getting soggy. The downside is that one is more likely to get peanut butter into the jar of jam or jelly. Serve with a glass of milk.

==Ingredients (for 1 person)==
* 2 slices of [[Cookbook:White Bread|White Bread]]
* [[Cookbook:Peanut Butter|Peanut Butter]]
* [[Cookbook:Jelly|Jelly]] or [[Cookbook:Jam|Jam]]

==Preparation==
#Using a spreading knife, spread an even coat of peanut butter on one side of each slice of bread.
#When the bread is evenly covered, spread an even coat of jelly atop the peanut butter.
#After applying the jelly, put one of the slices on a plate (jelly side up) and place the other slice on top of the first (jelly side down).

==Variations==
* Use whole wheat bread or an all-grain bread, whatever kind of bread you want.
* Add in some sliced banana.
* If using a crab apple jelly, a dash of cinnamon will nicely compliment the flavours of the sandwich.
* Replace the jelly with [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]].
* Replace the jelly with whipped cream cheese (a healthier fluffer-nutter) or keep the jelly and just add the cream cheese.

This pie is fairly sweet but is also quite tangy since rhubarb is its main ingredient. It is best served warm with a scoop of [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] [[Cookbook:Ice Cream|ice cream]].

==Ingredients==
* 1 recipe [[Cookbook:Flaky Pie Crust|Flaky Pie Crust]]
* 5 [[Cookbook:cup|cup]]s (1100g) of [[Cookbook:Rhubarb|rhubarb]] stalks (about 2 1/2 pounds)
* 1 &amp; 1/2 cups (360ml) of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1/4 cup of (60ml) [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]] or [[Cookbook:Tapioca|tapioca]] pearls
* 1/4 tsp of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

==Procedure==

===Crust===
# Prepare the [[Cookbook:Flaky Pie Crust|flaky pie crust]] and refrigerate while preparing the rhubarb.

===Filling===
# Clean and trim the rhubarb stalks.
# Cut the stalks into 1/2 inch to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5cm) sections.
# Add sugar, cornstarch or tapioca, and salt.
# Stir until rhubarb is evenly coated with dry ingredients.

Image:05-filling_ingredients.jpg|dry ingredients for filling
Image:06-filling_mixed.jpg|mixed fruit and dry ingredients for pie filling
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Forming and cooking the pie===
# Follow the instructions in the [[Cookbook:Flaky_Pie_Crust#To_Form_a_Covered_Pie|flaky pie crust]] recipe.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* If cornstarch is used as the thickener, the pie requires a longer cooling time before the filling is gelled.

* Another variation is to use a whole egg in the mix.

* This cookbook also has a recipe for [[Cookbook:Strawberry Rhubarb Pie|strawberry rhubarb pie]].

==Ingredients==
* 1 1/2 cup shredded dried [[Cookbook:Seaweed|seaweed]]
* 4 cups water
* 3 very large cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], crushed but not peeled.
* 1 1/2 tbsp. black [[Cookbook:Peppercorn|peppercorns]]

* Extra boiling water as needed

==Procedure==
# Place the seaweed in a pot and add 4 cups of water. 
# Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat to keep it bubbling along. 
# Cook for 20 minutes.
# Add the rest of the ingredients and enough water to make about 6 cups total in the pot. 
# Bring back to a boil, then boil fairly high for at least 1/2 hour. 
# At that point, begin to taste (just a little, though--it's strong). 
# When the stock is reduced by about half, it will be almost too salty to eat, and that means it is ready. 
# Strain through fine mesh or a coffee filter and allow to cool.

==Ingredients==
*1 large fish (weighing about 2 lbs/1 kg) 
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Olive oil|olive oil]]
*2 cups uncooked [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] 
*1 1/2 cups chopped [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]] 
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon juice]] and water 

== Procedure ==
# Fry fish in olive oil until well cooked. Remove the fish and allow to cool.
# Fry the chopped onions in the same oil until well browned. Meanwhile, bone the fried fish, reserving the cooked fillets to be served over the rice. 
# Add the head, bones and skin of the fish to the fried onions and cook with four cups of water in a pressure cooker for 15 minutes, or for a longer time in an open pan. 
# Strain the broth and boil the rice in it using 1-4 cups of broth for each cup of rice (this will depend on the absorbency of the rice you use). 
# Simmer the rice on a low fire so that most of the broth will be absorbed. 

Some of the broth may be flavored with a few drops of lemon and served on the side as a sauce for this dish.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian Cuisine]]

==Ingredients==
To make approximately 4 large naan breads:
* 3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] (450g) plain [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1 cup (240ml) [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]]
* 2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 3/4 cup (180ml) water

==Procedure==
# [[Cookbook:Kneading|Knead]] the dough by combining all the ingredients and sufficient water (this will be approximately 3/4 cup but some judgement is required).
# Wrap the dough in a damp muslin cloth and leave it to rise for 2-3 hours.
# Divide the dough into small balls.
# Roll out the balls in oblong or round shape with a rolling pin or by slapping and stretching with your hands.
# Smear the surface with water and bake in a tandoor or preheated oven (as hot as your oven will go).
# The naans should puff up a little, and be ready to remove from the oven in 4 to 5 minutes.
# Brush the naan with butter. Serve hot.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* To add an extra crispy finish, pop the baked naans under a preheated grill for 30 seconds before brushing with butter and serving.
* To add extra flavour, consider adding finely chopped garlic and coriander to the butter you brush over your cooked naan breads. Then return them to the oven (or place under a grill) for a short time to cook the garlic.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Cuisine of Italy]] | [[Cookbook:Pasta Recipes|Pasta Recipes]]

There are as many ways of preparing '''Pasta e Fagioli''' (or ''Basta Fazool'' if you come from southern Italy) as there are Italians.  I remember, growing up in Brooklyn in the 1940's, all the Italians would have it every Friday night because it is meatless. Usually it is a soup dominated by tomatoes.  This recipe, in contrast, is the consistency of a stew, and is dominated by the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umami#Umami umami] flavor.

{{see also|Cookbook:Pasta and bean soup}}

==Ingredients==
*1 pound dried white [[Cookbook:Legumes|beans]]
*1 cup of [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*a whole clove of [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic]], unshelled
*1 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaf]]
*1 teaspoon or more crushed or ground [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|hot red pepper]]
*fresh [[Cookbook:parsley|parsley]]
*½ pound of small diameter [[Cookbook:Pasta|macaroni]], whole [[Cookbook:wheat|wheat]] is best
*[[Cookbook:salt|salt]] to taste.

==Procedure==
#Put washed beans in salted water, 3 parts to 1 part beans.
#Soak overnight  OR bring to boil, boil 2 minutes and let stand, covered, for 1 hour.
#Do not drain beans, but bring to a boil.
#Skim off foam and add oil, garlic and bay leaf.
#Simmer for about 2 hours, or until tender.
#Cook pasta for 6 or 7 minutes, but don't let it get too soft.
#Drain pasta and save some of the water.
#Stir pasta and red pepper into beans and simmer until pasta is eatably soft, adding some of the saved water if necessary.
#Garnish with red pepper to taste and parsley.

==Notes, tips and variations==
*Beans: Use whichever sort is the favorite in your neighborhood and likely to be freshest.  In Southern California that would be [[Cookbook:Pinto Bean|pinto beans]], in the deep South, [[Cookbook:Black-Eyed Pea|black-eyed peas]] or perhaps [[Cookbook:Lima Bean|butter beans]]. [[Cookbook:Chickpea|Garbanzos]] might be good. [[Cookbook:Navy Bean|Navy beans]] are always safe.
*Olive oil: Use the best grade you can get:  Cold pressed, Extra Virgin.
*With a salad and some red wine this is a hearty meal, and can be eaten the next day, cold or reheated.
*Stop laughing at the name. It's not that funny.

== Ingredients ==  
* 4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Blanching|blanched]] [[Cookbook:Almond|almonds]]
* 4 cups water
* 3 cups [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]- optional, it is healthier without sugar

'''Skillet Cornbread''' - Commonly found in the Southern United States, this delicious and easy to make dish is often served beside a pot of brown beans.  It can be made a day or two ahead of time, as long as care is taken to keep it from drying out.

==Ingredients==
*3/4 cup white all-purpose [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*2 1/2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
*1 to 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:White sugar|white sugar]]
*3/4 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1 1/4 cups yellow or white [[Cookbook:Cornmeal|corn meal]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
*2 to 3 tablespoons melted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:Lard|pan drippings]]
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] or buttermilk.

==Procedure==
#Preheat the oven to 425°F
#Grease the skillet with bacon drippings (ideal) or oil. Butter isn't recommended, since it can burn when you preheat the skillet.
#Preheat the skillet until the drippings/oil is smoking. This ensures a good crust on the bottom of the cornbread.
#In a bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt.  Thoroughly mix the sifted ingredients together and add the corn meal.
#In a second bowl, beat the egg well.  Add the melted butter (or pan drippings) and the milk and continue to beat until well mixed.
#Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix using fast strokes.  Take care not to overmix.
#Pour the batter into the skillet and place in the oven.  Bake for 25-30 minutes.  The cornbread should have a golden brown color when done, and a knitting needle or knife-point will come out &quot;dry&quot; when inserted in the bread.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Ideally, all ingredients should be at room temperature (about 75°F) for this recipe.  However, a good result can still be had if this is not the case.
*Yellow corn meal is preferable to white corn meal, but this can vary according to locality and personal taste.
*Optionally, 1/4 to 1/2 cup of diced cooked ham or crumbled bacon can be added to the batter before pouring into the skillet.  This may add a few minutes to the baking time.

==Warnings==
*The skillet must be oven-safe. Ideally, skillet cornbread should be baked in a cast-iron skillet.

== Ingredients ==
*1 [[Cookbook:cabbage|cabbage]], chopped
*3 [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic]] cloves, minced
*3 large [[Cookbook:beet|beet]]s, cubed (or 2 cans of beets)
*5 large [[Cookbook:carrot|carrot]]s, chopped
*1  large [[Cookbook:onion|onion]], chopped
*4 stalks of [[Cookbook:celery|celery]], chopped
*2 lb. [[Cookbook:meat|meat]], cubed
*1 lb. [[Cookbook:stew bone|stew bone]]s
*3 [[Cookbook:lemon|lemon]]s (optional)
*2 24 oz. cans crushed [[Cookbook:tomato|tomato]]es
*½ cup [[Cookbook:sugar|sugar]] (optional)

== Procedure ==
# If you are using fresh beets, you first need to place them in boiling water for an hour and a half to two hours.  For better flavor bake at 350 °F for an hour and a half. When they are soft enough that a fork will go in easily they are done.  Put them in a sink or large bowl full of cool water.  Once they are cool pick up a beet and press your thumbs into the skin to start peeling them, sometimes they are not soft enough for this you just need to cook them longer. If you use canned beets they will be ready right out of the can.
# While the beets are cooking you should start cooking the meat.  Place the meat and bones into a large 12 qt. stock pot.  Add the two cans of crushed tomatoes and two cans of water.  Stir it up and bring to a boil.
# While the meat and beets are cooking chop up all of the veggies, mince the garlic and squeeze the lemons.
# After the meat has been boiling for an hour to 90 min. you should add all of the veggies except the beets which are still cooking, the lemon juice and the sugar.
# Finish peeling and cubing the beets, when the simmering veggies are soft add the beets, stir well.  Then add as much or as little lemon juice and sugar as you like, to suit your own taste.  Cook for five more minutes and it’s done.

'''Chocolate cheesecake''', rich in both chocolate and cheese.  It is noticeably less sweet than many other American desserts, and somewhat more complicated.

==Helpful equipment==
*[[Cookbook:Mixer|Electric mixer]]
*[[Cookbook:Springform Pan|Springform pan]]

==Ingredients==
===Crust===
*5 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|Tbs]] [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], melted 
*2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] chocolate wafer crumbs, or the equivalent in chocolate [[Cookbook:Cookie|cookies]] or chocolate [[Cookbook:Graham Cracker|Graham crackers]]
===Filling===
*3 packages (8 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounces]] each) [[Cookbook:Cream Cheese|cream cheese]], at room temperature
*1 cup brown [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]], packed
*5 large [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]s
*4 ounces (4 squares) [[Cookbook:Chocolate|semisweet chocolate]], melted
===Frosting===
*6 ounces (6 squares) semisweet chocolate, melted 
*½ cup [[Cookbook:Sour Cream|sour cream]]

==Procedure==
#Place rack in center of the oven. Preheat oven to 150 °C (300 °F).
#If starting with whole cookies, crackers, or wafers, place them in a sturdy plastic bag a few at a time and crush using a [[Cookbook:Rolling Pin|rolling pin]], or grind using a [[Cookbook:Food Processor|food processor]].
#Mix together chocolate crumbs and melted butter.
#Press crumb mixture into bottom and sides of 9-inch springform pan. 
#In a large bowl, beat together sugar and eggs at medium speed, slowly adding cream cheese, until smooth and fluffy. 
#Spoon half of cream cheese mixture into crust.
#Melt 4 ounces of chocolate using a [[Cookbook:Double Boiler|double boiler]] or, with care, a [[Cookbook:Microwave Oven|microwave]].  Stir into remaining cream cheese mixture until well blended. 
#Drizzle over batter in crust.  Draw a spoon or other implement through the batter a few times to make swirls. Spread evenly.
#Bake cheesecake for 50 minutes.  After the first 30 minutes has gone by, place aluminum foil on top to prevent cracking and scorching.  
#Cool completely.
#Cover with plastic wrap, and chill for about 2 hours, up to several days.
#Transfer cheesecake to a serving plate.
#Uncover cheesecake; carefully remove side of pan.
=== Frosting ===
#Melt remaining chocolate.
#Mix with sour cream.
#Spread over cake, and chill to set.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Brown sugar is not absolutely necessary (can substitute granulated), but it provides better flavor.
*If no electric mixer is available, the cream cheese can be mixed with egg yolks one-at-a-time before the whites are added.  Unless you find separating eggs extremely difficult, this will be worthwhile for the effort saved in mixing.
*Without a springform pan, a cake this stiff will require that at least the first piece be broken up in the process of serving.  Fortunately, it's often easy to find someone who [[Cookbook:Aesthetics|doesn't care]].
*Without aluminum foil, the top of the cake will crack and brown somewhat, but frosting covers it effectively, making it practically unnoticeable.

'''Damper''' is Australian bushman's bread, made while camping or &quot;waltzing matilda&quot; (carrying a swag around looking for work). It is meant to be made outside by a campfire.

==Ingredients==

* 1 large cup [[Cookbook:Self Raising Flour|self-raising flour]]
* generous pinch of [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
* 1/4 cup [[Cookbook:water|water]] [[Image:Mustering camp.jpg|250px|thumb|Damper and camp oven used, Walcha, NSW]]

==Procedure==
# Add salt to flour.
# Add scant 1/4 cup water (more and it will be as tough as an old boot).
# [[Cookbook:Mix|Mix]] and form into a round loaf.
# Dig a foot-deep hole near a fire and add 2 shovelsful of hot coals and ash. 
# Add damper mixture to a greased [[Cookbook:dutch oven|camp oven]] (traditonal cast iron round pot with lid).
# Cook for maximum of 40 minutes. If undercooked it will be flat and rubbery.
# Your first try may be inedible. Keep trying, you'll soon be an expert.

==Variations==
* This cookbook also has a [[Cookbook:Drover's Damper|Drover's damper]] recipe.
* You can do this in a barbecue grill with mixture in greased metal foil as well. During cooking, damper increases volume by 1/3 to 1/2, so allow room for expansion.
* If you aren't outdoors, just add mixture to  greased oven tray and cook in a moderate oven for 30 - 40 minutes.

This &quot;jolly good&quot; dessert was originally created in an old London bakery. At one point in time it was very popular throughout all of England. It has now has spread throughout Europe and the Americas, especially the north-east region of North America (with Bostonians having developed a particular liking for it). The ingredients are simple, the time it takes to prepare is short, and the dessert is simply delicious!

== Ingredients ==
* 2 bananas, peeled and sliced
* 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
* 2 tablespoons melted butter
* 1 refrigerated can of cinnamon rolls
* 1 cup caramel topping (similar to sundae toppings)
* 2-3 cups vanilla ice cream '''(optional)''' 

== Procedure ==
# Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
# In a small bowl, combine bananas, vanilla, and melted butter, until bananas are well coated. On a cookie sheet, unroll two cinnamon rolls, leaving the two triangles attached to form a square. Place 1/4 of banana mixture in the center of each pair of rolls.
# Bake for 11 to 13 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown. Heat the caramel topping and drizzle over dessert. Serve warm. It can also be served with a side dish of ice cream if one chooses.

'''Roast Potatoes''' also known colloquially as 'roasties'. Roast potatoes are usually used as the prime potato-based accompaniment to a [[Cookbook:Roast Dinner|roast dinner]] (usually made up of a roast meat and several different vegetables). Some people, however, prefer to make and eat them by themselves.

==Ingredients==
*[[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]
*[[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] (vegetable, sunflower or Olive Oil)
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] (optional)
*[[Cookbook:Water|water]]

==Procedure==
#Pre-heat the oven to [[Cookbook:Oven temperatures|gas mark 7]] (425&amp;#176;[[Cookbook:Fahrenheit|F]], 220&amp;#176;[[Cookbook:Celsius|C]]).
#Pour enough oil into the bottom of the roasting tin to leave a thin layer on the bottom and put it in the oven.
#Peel the potatoes and slice them into quarters or eighths depending on the size of the potato. Smaller pieces tend to make crispier roast potatoes, larger pieces tend to make softer ones.
#Put the potatoes in a saucepan of water and add a pinch of salt if you wish.
#Cover, and bring the saucepan to the boil and then allow to simmer for 10 minutes.
#Drain the potatoes.
#Replace the lid and shake the potatoes vigorously for 20-30 seconds.
#Remove the roasting tin from the oven and tip the potatoes from the saucepan into the tin.
#Sprinkle salt over the top of the potatoes.
#Replace the roasting tin in the oven.
#Roast for 20-25 minutes, or until the potatoes are golden brown; remove them from the oven.

Serve hot.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
* For garlic potatoes; after draining the potatoes, add 1-2 cloves of crushed garlic.
* Times &amp; quantities are rough and can vary to suit individual tastes.
* Halfway through roasting you may wish to remove the tin and move the potatoes with a spoon and/or spoon some of the oil from the bottom of the tin onto the potatoes
* Potatoes can also be cooked in the same roasting tin as the meat if being included as part of a roast dinner; they should go in half an hour before the meal is to be served.

== Warnings ==
*The oil in the roasting tin will be well over 100&amp;#176;[[Cookbook:Celsius|C]]. Be extremely careful when handling the tin.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Scotland|Cuisine of Scotland]]

'''Colcannon''' is a rich mashed potato dish, with cabbage, butter and other ingredients.

This has always been a favorite in my house. It's very easy to make and is a nice change from ordinary mashed potatoes. 

This is from an old Scottish recipe still used frequently to this day.

==Ingredients==
*[[Cookbook:Potato|Potato]], boiled
*[[Cookbook:Cabbage|Cabbage]], boiled
*[[Cookbook:Butter|Butter]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]]
*[[Cookbook:Pepper|Pepper]]

==Procedure==
#Take equal quantities of [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] and [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]]. 
#Mash the potatoes and mince the cabbage. 
#Melt a piece of [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or dripping in a saucepan, allowing approximately one ounce to one pound vegetables. 
#Put in the potatoes and cabbage, and [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste.
#Mix well, make thoroughly hot and serve. 

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*The mixture may be turned into a greased pie-dish, sprinkled with grated cheese, dotted with butter or margarine, and browned in a hot oven.

== Irish Original ==
Colcannon is originally an Irish dish, a very rich and occasional treat. Its sloppiness is balanced by the crunch of the cabbage, and it should taste a little peppery.

'''Ingredients'''
*450g spuds - floury maris piper/golden wonders are best; leave skin on if you want
*150 ml single cream
*mace/paprika
*450g shredded cabbage - white or savoy
*2 small leeks, or a bunch of spring onion tops, chopped
*125g unsalted butter
*200g mature gouda cheese grated
*salt and pepper

'''Ready, steady....'''
*Boil or steam the spuds, until soft, then shake the drained spuds in a deep pot with the lid on, until they crumble. Mash the crumbled spuds up with a fork and season with the salt, pepper and mace/paprika, before stirring in the cream. Add 100g of the butter in pieces and put the lid back on, leaving the butter to melt, before giving a hard stir. Transfer the mix to a deep pyrex bowl.

*Blanch the cabbage in boiling water for 2 mins and drain. Fry the leeks/onion tops in the remaining butter for a few minutes, then add the cabbage and toss around for a few more minutes. Spoon the cabbage into the pyrex bowl and mix with the mashed spuds.

*Stir the gouda in to the mix, leaving a little to coat the top, and put the bowl in an oven on 2/3 heat for 20 mins. - or until the cheese is melted.

The gouda is an innovation - leave it out, if you don't want the dish too rich. The oven heating is ideally done along with the final stage of your roast meat. Seasoning is very important: bear in mind that the cheese has plenty of salt. The perfect colcannon has a butter sogginess at the bottom of the bowl when removed from the oven.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Germany|German Cuisine]]

'''Black Forest Cake''', sometimes called by the French ''gateau'', ''gateaux'' or ''gâteau'' (meaning &quot;cake&quot;), is a chocolate cake with a strong cherry element, popular throughout North America.  The recipe originates from Germany, where it is called '''Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte'''.

* 1/4 teaspoon ground [[Cookbook:cinnamon|cinnamon]]
* 1/4 pint [[Cookbook:Sour Cream|sour cream]]
* 3 tablespoons strong cold black [[Cookbook:coffee|coffee]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:egg|egg]]s
* pinch of [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]

=== Pastry base ===

* 4oz/100g [[Cookbook:cream flour|cream flour]]
* pinch of [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
* 2oz /50g [[Cookbook:Powdered Sugar|icing sugar]]
* 2 oz/50g Irish [[Cookbook:butter|butter]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:egg yolk|egg yolk]]
* a few drops of [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla essence]]

=== Misc. ===

* 1 pint [[Cookbook:cream|cream]]
* 1-lb tin black [[Cookbook:cherry|cherries]]
* 4 tablespoons [[Cookbook:black cherry jam|black cherry jam]]
* [[Cookbook:brandy|brandy]] or [[Cookbook:cherry juice|cherry juice]]
* 4oz/100g grated [[Cookbook:chocolate|chocolate]]

== Procedure ==

=== Cake ===

# [[Cookbook:Creaming|Cream]] the butter and sugar together well.
# Melt the chocolate and beat into the creamed mixture, then mix in the eggs.
# Sift flour, salt and cinnamon together.
# Fold the dry mix lightly into the liquids, then fold in the sour cream and cold coffee.
# Pour the mixture into a lined and greased 9-inch round, deep tin,and bake for 1 hour and 25 minutes.
# Set to cool on a wire rack.

=== Pastry base ===

# Mix all the ingredients together in a bowl and bind until the mixture stiffens.
# Roll the pastry onto a floured board worktable until pastry is about the same size as the base of the tin.
# Lay out on baking sheet and bake for 20-25 minutes.

=== Assembly ===

# Whip cream until it holds its shape.
# Put some whipped cream into pastry piping bag with a star pipe attached, and reserve this for the decoration.
# Slice the cake into 3 equal-sized layers.
# Drain the cherries, reserve 8 for decoration and remove the stones from the remainder.
# Put pastry on serving plate and spread the pastry with black cherry jam.
# Soak the cakes with spirit. 
# Put one layer of cake on top of coated pastry.
# Spread a layer of cream with half the stoned cherries.
# Put the second layer of cake and add another layer of cream and cherries.
# Add the final layer of the cake.
# Cover the entire cake with the remaining cream and press on the grated chocolate. Decorate the top with piped rosettes of cream and the reserved whole black cherries.

== Notes, tips and variations ==

* Using 3 identical cake pans instead of 1 large one is acceptable.

* Margarine, vegetable oil or regular butter will substitute for Irish butter.

* In some countries (e.g. Austria and Australia) the brandy is often replaced by rum, in Germany itself it is almost always replaced by Kirschwasser.

* '''This did not come with a temperature to bake at for either the pastry or cake.'''  Cakes usually work at between 325°F and 400°F (160°C and 205°C).  Pastries usually work at between 350°F and 425°F (175°C and 220°C).

== Ingredients ==
*1 lb [[Cookbook:Ground Beef|ground beef]]
*1 tsp [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1 tsp [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]
*1 tsp [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] powder
*1 tsp [[Cookbook:Cayenne Pepper|cayenne pepper]]
*about 1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Feta Cheese|feta cheese]]

== Procedure ==
# Mix spices into beef, using hands, until well-mixed. 
# Form eight small balls of meat, then press into very flat [[Cookbook:Pancake|pancake]] shapes. 
# Top four with about 2 tbsp. crumbled feta cheese, then cover with the other four. 
# Press together firmly to flatten, then crimp edges tightly to make four [[Cookbook:Burger|burger]]s. 
# Chill.
# Cook as regular burgers in a [[Cookbook:Skillet|skillet]] or on the [[Cookbook:Grill|grill]]. Handle gently to avoid crumbling. 

Serve on toasted white or [[Cookbook:Rye|rye]] [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] with spicy [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]].

Makes four burgers.

== Notes, tips and variations ==
* Any other [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]] that doesn’t melt easily can be substituted for feta in this recipe. Some possibilities are [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|parmesan]], [[Cookbook:Swiss Cheese|Swiss]], and [[Cookbook:Jarlsberg Cheese|Jarlsberg]]. If you use a cheese that melts and becomes runny, however, it will all drip out.
* If you plan to grill the burgers, you can opt to mix the feta in with the beef and simply treat as regular burgers. Don’t try this on a skillet, however, as the cheese will stick and burn.

==Ingredents==
* 1¾ cups (420g) [[Cookbook:flour|flour]]
* ⅓ cup (160ml) [[Cookbook:sugar|sugar]]

==Procedure==
#Grease muffin cups or line with paper cups; set aside.

'''Rhubarb crumble''' is a traditional [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|British]] [[Cookbook:Dessert|dessert]]. Served with [[Cookbook:Custard|custard]], [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]] or [[Cookbook:Vanilla Ice Cream|ice cream]] it is a hearty, filling, and warm feast, best served after a light meal.

==Ingredients==

*1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Brown sugar|brown sugar]]
*3/4 cup [[Cookbook:Oats|oat]]s
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1/2 cup [[Cookbook:butter|butter]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*4 cup uncooked cut up [[Cookbook:Rhubarb|rhubarb]]
*1 cup [[Cookbook:White Sugar|white sugar]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbsp]] [[Cookbook:Corn Starch|corn starch]]/cornflour
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]]

==Method==
#Mix brown sugar, oats, flour, butter and cinnamon until crumbly.
#Press 1/2 of mixture into a 9 inch square pan.
# Cover crumb mixture with cut up rhubarb.
# Mix white sugar, cornstarch and water. Cook until clear and thick, [[Cookbook:Stirring|stirring]] constantly. Add vanilla and stir.
# Pour over rhubarb. Sprinkle with remaining crumb mixture over the top. 
# [[Cookbook:Baking|Bake]] for 1 hour at 180&amp;deg;[[Cookbook:Celsius|C]].

==Alternative method==
Many cooks use cold butter and rub the fat into the dry ingredients. It is also common not to have a crumble layer on the bottom, just on top of the rhubarb. Finally the cornstarch sauce is frequently omitted. Raw rhubarb and sugar alone are used. The rhubarb juice acts as a sufficient sauce.

This is a recipe made up by a Mexican who has eaten this dish hundreds if not thousands of times throughout his lifetime.  Growing up with a single mother, from a remote part of Jalisco, Mexico, who made this dish as a quick meal, one can appreciate the simplicity of this dish.  A lot of what goes into the making of this dish is up to your own taste:  how much and what kind of cheese for example, or what type of chili sauce is used (i.e. green or red and the intensity of its heat level).  The three main components of this dish include: deep fried tortilla strips, some sort of chili sauce and a good serving of cheese that is crumbled over the finished dish towards the end.  In addition, one can add any number of extra ingredients to his or her own delight.  The following recipe is quite common in most of Mexico as a breakfast item, due to the addition of eggs, but is also eaten throughout the day including during dinner time.  Remember, keep it simple and tasty.  You definately don't need to bake this dish, it never is in Mexico (except for a variant of this dish called Pastel Azteca which is considerably more elaborate).  I've included an additional recipe for a ''salsa de chile de arbol'' that will be used as the primary sauce.  It's a little spicy and may take some time to prepare but is well worth the extra effort.  The following recipe is intended as a single serving, adjust the ingredients exponentially to make larger quantities.

= Ingredients = 
* Vegetable Oil (enough to cover the tortillas to deep fry them)
* 2 Corn Tortillas cut into strips and then into squares (preferably day old)
* 1 large Egg
* 1/4 of an Onion diced (white onion is mainly used in Mexican cooking)

* '''Salsa de Chile de Arbol'''
* 1 cup of Tomatillos, husks taken off and roasted (these are found extensively in most Mexican groceries and are somewhat common in larger urban supermarkets)
* 4 to 6 dried Chiles de Arbol roasted (these are quite hot and you should adjust to your liking)
* 1 roasted Garlic
* 1/2 cup of Water
* Salt and Pepper to taste

* crumbled or shredded Cheese (you can use anything that melts well, i like to use monterey jack or manchego, however you can utilize your favorite cheese for this recipe)

== Procedure == 

# Begin by making the ''Salsa de Chile de Arbol'': roast the tomatillos by wrapping them in heavy duty aluminum foil and placing them on a comal over your stovetop (this does not need to be done in the oven, it never is in Mexico).  After roasting the tomatillos for approximately 15 to 20 minutes you can pull them off the fire and roast the dried chilies and garlic directly on the comal (caution, the dried chilies will roast in less than a minute while the garlic will take longer).  Combine the roasted tomatillos, chilies and garlic along with the water, salt and pepper in a blender.  Liquify the mixture thoroughly for a few minutes to insure that the sauce is smooth and consistent with no large pieces left floating around.  You will probably end up with more salsa than you need for this recipe.  Use it as a condiment for any other of your favorite Mexican dishes!
# Next, heat the vegetable oil in a frying pan until it is hot enough so that when you drop the pieces of tortillas into it they immediately begin to fry at a rapid pace.
# Allow the tortillas to fry until they become a chestnut brown, just not too dark or burnt.  At this point, drain most of the oil out of the pan leaving only enough to fry the rest of the ingredients.
# Crack the egg into the fried tortillas and scramble it, folding the fried tortilla strips into the egg.  At this point season this mixture with salt and pepper if desired.  Take this mixture out of the pan and let it rest on a plate while you continue with the rest of the dish.
# Add some of the oil that was taken out of the pan earlier back into it and heat it up again.  To this add the diced onion and allow it to soften for a few minutes.  Add the ''Salsa de Chile de Arbol'' to the oil and onions and saute it for a minute or two.  Add a little bit of water to dilute it if it becomes too thick.
# Finally, return the fried tortilla and egg mixture to the onion and chili sauce in the pan and allow it cook only for about a minute, enough time to allow the tortillas to soak up some of the sauce.  Before plating it, add the cheese and enjoy!

Variations

In Mexico, very rarely is this dish made with tortilla chips but rather day-old tortillas that have stiffened.  If you don't have day-old tortillas you can leave out fresh tortillas until they are stiff to get the right texture.  The recipe for the chili sauce used in this recipe is of course a red sauce.  If you prefer a green sauce, simply subsitute the chiles de arbol for fresh jalapeno chilies that you can also roast in the same way.  After you have roasted the chilies on the comal and thoroughly burnt the skins, place the chilies in a plastic bag with a small amount of water so as to allow them to steam.  After about 5 minutes, remove the jalapenos from the bag and simply rub the skin off of them.  Continue to make the sauce as indicated above.

Also this dish can be made with strips of chicken in addition to or as a replacement for the egg.  In Mexico chilaquiles are often served throughout the day and as such the addition of chicken strips will complement it as a dinner item.  Using all the same ingredients just add some warmed and shredded chicken meat during the last step before you add the cheese.  Often times, my mother would add a little bit of mexican cream (somewhat like sour cream but more akin to creme fraiche) over the top of the chilaquiles right before we enjoyed them on our serving plate as a way to tone down the spicy heat of the dish.

An '''oatcake''' is a type of [[Cookbook:Pancake|pancake]] made from [[Cookbook:Oatmeal|oatmeal]],  cooked on a [[Cookbook:Griddle|griddle]].

==North Staffordshire Oatcakes==
North Staffordshire oatcakes are a local delicacy in the North [[w:Staffordshire|Staffordshire]] ([[w:Stoke-on-Trent|Stoke-on-Trent]]) area of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|England]], and so may be known to non-locals as a ''North Staffordshire oatcake'' or ''Potteries oatcake''. These use [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] and [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]], whereas other oatcakes do not. When pre-cooked, they are a form of fast food, and catering outlets in the area usually offer oatcakes with fillings such as [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]], [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]], [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausage]] and [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]. They can be re-heated by [[Cookbook:Frying|frying]] in butter, or by [[Cookbook:Grilling|grilling]]. In addition, [[Cookbook:Pikelet|pikelets]] are often served alongside oatcakes in a similar fashion.

=== Ingredients ===
* 8oz fine oatmeal
* 8oz wholewheat or plain flour
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/2oz fresh yeast
* 1 1/2 pints warm milk and water, mixed half and half
* 1 teaspoon sugar

=== Procedure ===
# Add the salt to the flour and oatmeal.
# Dissolve the yeast with a little warm liquid and add the sugar. Allow the mixture to become frothy.
# Mix the dry ingredients with the yeast liquid to make a batter.
# Cover the batter with a clean cloth and leave it in a warm place for an hour.
# Bake the oatcake on a well-greased griddle. Put enough batter onto the griddle to produce an oatcake about 8-9 inches in diameter. The surface will be covered in holes as it cooks. 
# Turn the oatcake after 2 - 3 minutes when the upper side appears dry and the underneath is golden brown, and cook for another 2 - 3 minutes.

A refreshing topping for carbohydrate and meat-style foods. The [[:Category:South American recipes|South American]] equivalent of [[Cookbook:Salsa|salsa]]. Sarza Criolla goes well on [[Cookbook:Toast|toast]], slabs of boiled potatoes, [[Cookbook:Seafood|seafood]], [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]], [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]], [[Cookbook:Tamales|tamales]], and [[Cookbook:Quesadilla|quesadillas]].

== Ingredients ==
* 1 [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]]
* chopped [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]] (optional)
* chopped boiled [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] (optional)
* chopped boiled or pickled [[Cookbook:Beet|beets]] (optional)
* chopped (not mashed) [[Cookbook:Avocado|avocado]] (optional)

==Procedure==
# Cleave the onion from top to bottom, along the grain, then slice it fine across the grain, forming half-rings. 
# Rinse in cold water, soak in cold water for around 5 minutes, and rinse again.  This procedure washes away the contents of the plant cells destroyed by the knife, taking the sting out of the onion's flavor.
# Squeeze over it the juice of the lime.
# Optionally toss in the cilantro, potatoes, beets, or avocado.

* 1/2 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:vanilla|vanilla]]
* 1 1/4 cup of [[Cookbook:flour|all-purpose flour]]
* 1/4 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
* 3/4 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:baking soda|baking soda]]

== Procedure ==

# Start by preheating oven to [[Cookbook:Oven_Temperature|375° F]].
# Cream together sugars, melted butter, egg, and vanilla until creamy and smooth. If you're low on brown sugar, seek tip section below.
# Combine flour, peanut butter, salt, and baking soda in the mixture from step 2.
# After mixture is complete, flatten small pieces into cookie shapes with a fork and place on ungreased cooking pan at least 2 inches apart.
# Bake in oven for 8-10 minutes, or until golden brown.
# Pull out of oven and allow to cool.

== Notes, tips and variations ==

* If low on brown sugar, combine white sugar and 1 tablespoon of molasses together.
* To give a sparkly look, dip cookie in step 4 on a small saucer sprinkled with sugar.
* Smooth peanut butter works much better than chunky.
* To flatten with a fork, press the tines of the fork across the cookie and then repeat going in the other direction to give a crisscross pattern.
* For the alternate recipe (see below), you can use peanut oil instead of vegetable oil.

== Alternate Recipe ==

[[Image:2006-June-26-Peanut-Butter-Cookies-Uncooked.JPG|thumb|right|200px|In the process of being flattened by fork.]]

This recipe has no egg or baking soda, and uses vegetable oil instead of butter / margarine; it adds honey.

==Ingredients:==

* 1/2 cup peanut butter
* 1/4 cup [[Cookbook:honey|honey]]
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 cup [[Cookbook:oil|vegetable oil]] (see tip above)
* 1/4 cup brown sugar (or white sugar and molasses, as above)
* 1 teaspoon vanilla
* 1 1/4 cup whole wheat pastry flour (other flours likely work fine)

==Procedure:==

# Preheat oven to 375ºF
# Cream all ingredients except flour together.
# Add flour and mix sparingly (should be dry enough to form into balls by hand without sticking).
# Form into walnut-sized balls and place on ungreased cookie sheet.
# Flatten with fork (see tip above).
# Bake for about 8-10 minutes.

A double recipe makes about seventy 1 1/2&quot; cookies.

{{raw-meat}}

'''Steak tartare''' is a meat dish made from finely chopped, or ground raw [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]. It is often served with [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]] and seasonings, and sometimes with raw [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]].

This dish is popular in [[w:Belgium|Belgium]], where it is known as ''Filet américain'' (&quot;American fillet&quot;).

== Ingredients == 
* 1/2 pound (225g) of quality beef (filet mignon) with all connective tissue removed.
* One egg yolk. 
* One Teaspoon [[w:Worcestershire sauce|Worcestershire]] or [[Cookbook:Soy sauce|Soy]] sauce. 
* One Tablespoon whole grain [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]]. 
* 1-3 drops of hot pepper sauce, as desired. 
* 2 Tablespoons of chopped onions.
* Salt and fresh ground pepper to taste. 

== Procedure ==
# Finely chop the beef, or run twice through a meat grinder with 1/4 inch (0.75cm) plate.
# Mix all the ingredients loosely and spread on bread slices ([[w:Rye|Rye]], [[w: Pumpernickel|Pumpernickel]], etc.) to make open-faced [[Cookbook:Sandwiches|sandwiches]].  The steak tartare may also be served on buttered [[Cookbook:Toast|toast]]. Serve on chilled plates with a favorite beverage.

'''Note that consumption of steak tartare made with contaminated ingredients can cause serious illness or death.  It is very likely that one can contract either pathogenic E Coli infection or salmonellosis since even the best ground beef is a composite of many different slaughtered animals, increasing the risk incrementally.'''

Biscuits &amp; Gravy is a dish enjoyed nearly everywhere in the United States, though it is most commonly associated with the southern states.  It is a staple breakfast of most US [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diner diners].

This recipe makes about 4 servings, and relies on this [[Cookbook:Biscuit|biscuit recipe]].
==Ingredients==
*1 [[Cookbook:Pound|lb]] (500 [[Cookbook:g|g]]) Ground [[Cookbook:Sausage|Breakfast Sausage]]
*3 [[Cookbook:Table_spoon|T]] (15 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Bacon|Bacon]] grease
*1/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|c]] (60 mL) [[Cookbook:Flour|Flour]]
*3 c (720 mL) [[Cookbook:Milk|Milk]]
*1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp.]](2.5 mL) [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]]
*1/4 tsp. (1.25 mL) Ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|Black Pepper]]
==Procedure==
'''Biscuits'''
#Make [[Cookbook:Biscuit|'cut' biscuit]] dough.
#Place the cut biscuits in the oven at the same time as step 3 of the gravy procedure.
#Remove from oven after 10 to 12 minutes; the  biscuits should be warm when served with the gravy.
'''Gravy'''
#Brown the sausage in a large skillet.
#Remove the browned sausage from the skillet and reserve in a bowl, be careful to leave as much of the drippings as possible in the pan.
#Add the bacon grease to the skillet, place the skillet on low to medium-low heat.
#Once the bacon grease is up to temperature mix the flour into the grease.
#Add the milk slowly, mixing as you pour.
#Bring to a gentle boil, stir constantly scraping the bottom and edges of the skillet.  Stirring keeps the gravy from becoming too lumpy or burnt.
#Continue stirring until the gravy has nearly reached the desired consistency, usually about 10 minutes.
#Add the browned sausage held in reserve.
#Remove from heat and allow to set for 1 minute.

==Serving==
Traditionally this breakfast is served on a plate.  A common serving is two biscuits, each halved, insides face up, covered in gravy.  Common side dishes are strips of bacon, hash browns, or grits.

'''Mother-In-Law's Milk''', or '''Latte di Suocera'''

La Suocera is as proverbial in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italy]] as she is anywhere else, and Italians (especially daughters-in-law) have come up with all sorts of ways to keep them content; one of the most popular items in candy stands at fairs is ''addormenta suocere'', candied nuts that supposedly send mothers-in-law off into a deep sleep (my mother-in-law simply enjoys them). Those who like to make liqueurs at home can also try this milk.

It will be a nice after dinner drink -- so nice I'd probably drink more than I gave my Suocera -- and will also work very well over vanilla ice cream.

==Ingredients==

* 1 1/8 pounds (500 g, or 2 1/8 cups) [[Cookbook:sugar|sugar]]
* 1 pint (500 ml) whole [[Cookbook:milk|milk]]
* 1 pint (500 ml) grain [[Cookbook:alcohol|alcohol]]
* grated zest of an organically grown [[Cookbook:lemon|lemon]]
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:vanilla|vanilla]] bean, split lengthwise

==Procedure==
#Combine all the ingredients in a wide-mouthed jar, screw the lid on tightly, 
#give them a good shake, and 
#put the jar in a dark place. 
#Shake it once a day for 8 days, and then 
#filter it and bottle it. 
#Stopper the bottle, put it in a cool dark place, and let it rest for a month before you open it.

#Clean the heart, removing all fat. Cut into bite size cubes. Place the heart pieces into the marinade mixture and leave to marinate for about 10 hours or overnight. The heart should be completely covered.
#After marinating, insert meat on skewers. At this stage if desired , some additional ingredients such as green pepper or red pepper (capsicum) or corn-on-cob (cut to a similar size to the heart, may be also inserted on the skewers.)  
#The skewered heart should then be cooked on a barbecue grill, turning frequently and brushing with the marinade mix. When they are well done they should be served immediately.

==Description / variations==

Anticuchos, is one of the most popular dishes in Peru. It is often sold by street vendors and accompanied by corn-on-the-cob and portions of cold boiled potato with a spot of chili sauce. Those whose tastes do not extend to trying beef heart may substitute any good cut of red meat, though this is not the authentic Peruvian style.

'''Flammekueche''' or '''Tarte flambée''' is a well-known Alsacian speciality.  It is like pizza in that a thin crust of dough is baked in a very hot oven, but its topping is primarily crème fraîche, onions, and bacon.  Like many traditional regional dishes there are innumerable ways of preparing it.  Here is one example.

==Ingredients==
===Starter for the dough===
* ¼ cup flour
* ¼ cup moderately hot water, about 110 degrees F (45 deg C)
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 1 package yeast

===Dough===
* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon salt
* ¼ cup beer (Homebrew)
* 6 tablespoons (¼ cup plus 2 tablespoons) milk

===Covering===
* 2 tablespoons oil
* 1 medium onion (3 ounces), finely chopped
* 1 cup crème fraîche, commercial or homemade (see note)
* ½ teaspoon salt 
* ¼ teaspoon pepper
* 4 pinches nutmeg
* 3 ounces bacon, cut into matchsticks

==Procedure==
# Mix the starter ingredients together in a small bowl, cover tightly, and set aside in a warm place for 30 minutes.
# When the starter is light and bubbly, mix the beer and milk into the mixture.
# Put the flour and salt into a food processor, then, with the motor running, add the yeast mixture through the feeding tube.  Process the dough until it forms a ball.  Add very small amounts of additional flour or milk if necessary.
# Process the ball until it is smooth, elastic, and warm, about 45 seconds to 1 minute.
# Butter a medium-sized bowl, roll the ball around in the butter, then cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled.  Punch down and let rise a second time.
# While the dough is rising, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a nonstick skillet.  Add the onion and cook, stirring, over low heat for 5 minutes or until golden brown.  Let cool.
# Combine the crème fraîche, salt, pepper, and nutmeg.  Add the cooled onion.
# Heat the remaining oil in the skillet and fry the bacon until lightly browned, stirring constantly.  Remove and drain through a strainer.
# Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (220 deg C) (or as hot as it will go) If using a pizza stone, preheat the oven for at least 30 minutes.
# Lightly oil a 14 x 16 inch baking sheet.  Roll the dough until slightly smaller than the baking sheet.  Place it on the sheet. If using a pizza stone you may roll the dough onto a sheet of parchment paper.
# Spread the onion mixture over the dough, leaving a very small raised rim all the way around, then dot with the bacon.
# Bake for 4 to 20 minutes depending on oven temp. Tart should is lightly browned &amp; bubbling. Burned/blackened edges are traditional.  Serve very hot.

'''NOTE:''' To make crème fraîche, combine 1 cup heavy cream with 2 tablespoons buttermilk, stir, cover with plastic wrap, and leave at room temperature for 12 to 24 hours, or until it has become very thick.  Refrigerate, and it will become even thicker.

A '''French Omelette''' or is a dish consisting of fried beaten eggs, often with an added filling.

==Ingredients==

* 4 eggs
* [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] and [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]].

==Procedure==

# Loosely mix the eggs. Season the mixture with some [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]].
# Heat a frying pan.
# Add oil and a small amount of butter when the pan starts to get hot. Enough to coat the pan entirely, but no more. Remove any excess oil.
# Let the pan get as hot as you can, without burning the butter, and keep the flame high.
# Pour the egg mixture into the pan and quickly tilt the pan to let it spread around the bottom.
# With a spoon or spatula, pull the solidified edges towards the center and tilt the pan to let the egg mixture fill the gap again. Keep repeating this (quickly) until there's not enough liquid egg left to fill the gap. (The top of the omelette should still be liquid). 
# Turn the flame down a little lower to fold the egg. Use a spatula to pry the edges loose from the pan. When the omelette is completely loose from the pan. Fold one part over the other. You can fold half of the omelette over the other half, or fold one third of the omelette inwards and then fold the remaining flap over that, to create a thicker, less wide omelette.
# Slide the omelette onto the plate.

The center of the omelette should be just barely cooked, and a little runny. The outside should be cooked, but not browned (or slightly browned). The center will continue to cook after the omelette is removed from the pan, so be sure to eat it right away.

== Notes, tips and variations ==

* The center of a good omelette should not be cooked completely. Because of this, there is a slight risk of salmonella poisoning. Be careful when serving omelettes to children, pregnant, elderly or ill people. Use pasturized egg to be completely sure.
* To decrease the amount of eggs used, use less eggs, and add some milk.
* Omelettes are often cooked with extra ingredients, or a 'filling'. How ingredients should be added depends on the ingredient. Some ingredients, like cheese, can be added to the egg mixture. Some should be fried before making the omelette (possibly in the same pan as the omelette, before adding the eggs). To use the ingredients more as a filling, than as a part of the mixture, add the to the omelette  just before folding.
* There are many ingredients and fillings that can be used in omelettes. Some suggestions:
** pre-cooked [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]].
** Any kind of [[Cookbook:Cheese|Cheese]].
** [[Cookbook:Broccoli|broccoli]].
** [[Cookbook:Olive|olives]].
** Chopped [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], optionally with seeds removed.
** Ham/salami/prosciutto
** Mushrooms ([[Cookbook:Sautéing|sauteéd]])

'''Focaccia''' is a flat, leavened bread native to Italy.

==Ingredients==
* 2 teaspoons active dry yeast (non-instant)
* 1 1/2 cups warm water (approx. 110 F)
* 4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
* 5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
* 3 teaspoons sea salt

==Procedure==

# Sprinkle one teaspoon of the yeast over 1/2 cup of the water in a medium bowl, stir to mix and let stand 10 minutes. Stir in 3/4 cup flour, cover tightly with plastic and let rise in warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes.
# In a large bowl, sprinkle the remaining teaspoon of yeast over one cup of warm water, mix and let stand 10 minutes. Add the first yeast mixture (now risen) along with 3 tablespoons of olive oil and 2 teaspoons of salt, mix well. Add the remaining flour gradually, mixing well after each addition until well incorporated. On a lightly floured work surface, turn the dough out and knead until soft, about 10 minutes.
# Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover tightly and let rise in warm place until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours. Oil an 11&quot; x 14&quot; baking pan and turn the risen dough out onto the pan, flattening it out to the edges. If the dough springs back too much to cover the pan, allow it to rest for 10 minutes before resuming. Cover with a clean towel and let rise 45 minutes to an hour. 
# Preheat oven to 425 F. Remove towel and press indentations into the dough with your fingertips, then drizzle with the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil, sprinkle with sea salt and place pan in oven. Bake 20 to 25 minutes, or until the top is golden. Remove the focaccia from the pan as soon as it is out of the oven and let cool on a rack before serving.

'''Cioppino''' is a [[Cookbook:fish|fish]] [[Cookbook:stew|stew]], a descendant of the various regional fish soups and stews of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian cooking]]. It was developed by the fishermen who settled in the North Beach section of San Francisco. Originally it was made on the boats while out at sea and later became a staple as Italian restaurants proliferated in the city by the Bay. The name comes from ''ciuppin'', a word which described the local fish stew in the regional dialect of the great port city of Genoa.

==Ingredients == 
* 1/4 cup [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* 2 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], diced
* 1 bunch [[Cookbook:Scallion|scallions]], chopped
* 1 [[Cookbook:Bell pepper|green pepper]], diced
* 1/2 bulb [[Cookbook:Fennel|fennel]], diced (optional, but very good)
* 3 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], minced
* 1 quart of [[Cookbook:Fish Stock|fish stock]] or cold water
* 3 cans Italian [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]] (16 oz.) including juice
* 1 cup dry white [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Bay leaf|bay leaves]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste
* 2 pounds assorted white firm-fleshed [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]] ([[Cookbook:Swordfish|swordfish]], [[Cookbook:Halibut|halibut]], [[Cookbook:Snapper|snapper]], [[Cookbook:Cod|cod]])
* 8-10 littleneck [[Cookbook:Clam|clams]]
* 3-4 hard-shelled [[Cookbook:Crab|crabs]], if available
* 15-20 medium [[Cookbook:Shrimp|shrimp]]
* 1 tablespoon chopped fresh [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]]
* 8-10 slices [[Cookbook:Italian Bread|Italian]] or [[Cookbook:Sourdough Bread|sourdough bread]]

== Procedure == 
# Heat the oil in a large soup pot. 
# Add the onions, scallions, peppers and fennel and [[Cookbook:Sauté|sauté]] until the onions are translucent. 
# Add the garlic and continue to sauté until the aroma becomes apparent. 
# Be careful not to brown or burn the garlic. 
# Add the white wine and cook until reduced by half. 
# Add the fish stock or water, tomatoes and bay leaves. 
# Cover the pot and simmer slowly for about 45 minutes, adding more water if necessary to maintain a fair amount of broth. 
# Remove and discard the bay leaves. 
# Add the clams and crabs and simmer for about ten minutes. 
# Add the shrimp and fish and simmer until the fish is cooked through and flakes easily. 
# Add the chopped basil and adjust the salt and pepper as needed. 
# During the final 15 or 20 minutes of cooking, rub the slices of bread with a little olive oil and the cut side of a garlic clove and toast lightly under the broiler or in the oven. 

To serve, put one of the bread slices in a soup bowl and ladle the stew over it.  Accompany with a dry white wine such as Sauvignon Blanc, Frascati or Pinot Grigio. Serves 8 to 10 people.

A unique dish only found in state of [[w:Johor|Johor]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Malaysia|Malaysia]] that is very rare nowdays, normally served to the royalties and social elites in Johor at formal functions and celebrations.

'''Potstickers''' (&amp;#38149;&amp;#36148; &amp;#37707;&amp;#36028; gu&amp;#333;ti&amp;#275;; literally &quot;pot stick&quot;) are a Northern Chinese style [[Cookbook:Dumpling|dumpling]] popular as a street food, appetizer, or side order in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japanese cuisine]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|Chinese cuisine]]. This dish is often served on a [[Cookbook:Dim sum|dim sum]] menu, but may be offered independently. The filling for this dish usually contains [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] (or [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]]), [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]], [[Cookbook:Scallion|scallion]]s, [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]], and [[Cookbook:Sesame seed|sesame seed]] oil. The mixed filling is sealed into a dumpling wrapper, steamed in a [[Cookbook:Wok|wok]], and then fried to crispness on one side in a shallow frying pan. The effect of the one crisp side of the dumpling is where it gets its English name of '''potsticker''' as it appears to have been stuck to the pot in which it was cooked. The potsticker is similar to the Japanese [[Cookbook:Gyoza|gyoza]] dumpling.

Yield: About 24 Potstickers

== Ingredients ==
* 1 package gyoza or wonton wrappers

=== Filling ===
* 1/2 pound ground chicken or pork
* 1/2 pound ground prawn or raw shrimp
* 12 raw prawns, chopped
* 1/2 cup water chestnuts, fresh if possible, peeled and sliced
* 1 tablespoon light soy sauce or Kikkoman
* 1 tablespoon sesame oil
* 1 tablespoon salt
* Pinch of white pepper if desired
* 3 tablespoons green/spring onion, minced
* 3 tablespoons ginger, minced
* 3 tablespoons cilantro, chopped

== Procedure ==
# Mix together the filling ingredients.
# Place a small bowl of water on the work area.  
# Lay out one of the gyoza wrappers in front of you.
# Dip your finger in the water and moisten the edges of the wrapper.
# Place a heaping teaspoon of filling in the middle of the wrapper.
# Fold the gyoza wrapper over the filling and pinch the edges to seal it shut.
# (You may want to use a cornstarch/water mixture to make this easier).
# Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet or wok.  
# When oil is ready, carefully add the dumplings and cook on high heat until golden brown (about 1 minute).
# Without turning the dumplings over, add 1 cup of water and cover.  
# Steam for about 1 minute to cook the raw filling and then turn off the heat (this is to keep the bottom from burning).  
# Let the dumplings cook for a few more minutes with the heat turned off.  

Serve the potstickers with Dipping Sauce or soy sauce.

{{recipe}}

==Ingredients==
* 1/2 pound prepared [[Cookbook:Puff pastry|puff pastry]]
* 3/4 cup [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 3 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* Four (1/2-inch thick) fresh [[Cookbook:Pineapple|pineapple]] slices, tough inner core removed; or canned pineapple slices
* [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]]
* Freshly ground [[Cookbook:Black Pepper|black pepper]]

== Procedure ==
=== Pastry ===
# On a lightly floured surface, roll the pastry into a square about 1/8-inch thick. 
# Using a 4-inch plate as a guide, or a cutter, cut four disks of pastry. 
# If you are using a plate, cut the pastry with a rolling pizza cutter or the tip of a small sharp knife. 
# Transfer the cut pastry rounds to a baking sheet. 
# Pierce the pastry 6 to 8 times with the tines of a fork. The punctures will help prevent the dough from rising unevenly during baking. 
# Chill the pastry in the refrigerator while you prepare the sugar. 

The disks can be prepared up to this point and refrigerated for 1 day or frozen for up to a week.

=== Tart ===
# Preheat the oven to 425° F. 
# In a small, heavy-bottomed pan, dissolve the sugar with the water. 
# Cook the sugar over medium-high heat until caramelized. 
# Do not stir the sugar as it cooks or it may recrystallize. 
# Swirl the pan when the sugar begins to brown. 
# Carefully pour the caramelized sugar into four 4-inch 10-ounce ramekins.
# Place the pineapple slices in the ramekins on top of the caramel and season lightly with salt and pepper. 
# Lay a pastry disk on top of each pineapple and transfer the ramekins to a baking sheet. 
# Bake the tarts for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the pastry is puffed and golden brown. 
# Remove ramekins from the oven and cool for 5 minutes. 
# Holding the ramekins carefully with a cooking mitt, twist the puff pastry to loosen the tart, caramel, and pineapple together. 
# Carefully invert the ramekins to release the tarts onto individual serving plates. 

Serve the tarts warm or at room temperature.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* Pastry can be purchased in the frozen food section of most markets.

In cooking, '''espagnole sauce''' is one of the [[Cookbook:Mother Sauces|mother sauces]] that are the basis of sauce-making in classic French cooking. [[Auguste Escoffier]] codified the recipe in the late 19th century, which is still followed today.  Even though ''espagnole'' is the French word for ''Spanish'', the sauce has little connection with Spanish cuisine.  According to Louis Diat, the creator of vichyssoise and the author of the classic ''Gourmet's Basic French Cookbook'': &quot;There is a story that explains why the most important basic brown sauce in French cuisine is called ''sauce espagnole'', or Spanish sauce.  According to the story, the Spanish cooks of Louis XIII's bride, Anne, helped to prepare their wedding feast, and insisted upon improving the rich brown sauce of France with Spanish tomatoes.  This new sauce was an instant success, and was gratefully named in honor of its creators.&quot;

The basic method of making espagnole is to prepare a very dark brown [[roux]], to which are added several gallons of [[veal stock]] or water, along with 20 or 30 pounds of browned bones, pieces of beef, many pounds of vegetables, and various seasonings.  This blend is allowed to slowly reduce while being frequently skimmed. The classical recipe calls for additional veal stock to be added as the liquid gradually reduces but today water is generally used instead.  Tomato sauce is added towards the end of the process, and the sauce is further reduced.

Espagnole has a strong, even somewhat unpleasant taste and is not itself used directly on food. As a ''mother sauce'', however, it then serves as the starting point for many ''derivative sauces''. Examples are: Sauce Africaine, Sauce Bigarade, Sauce Bouguignonne, Sauce aux Champignons, Sauce Charcutiere, Sauce Chasseur, and Sauce Chevreuil, just to go as far as the &quot;Cs&quot;.  There are hundreds of others in the classic French repertoire.

A typical espagnole recipe takes many hours or even several days to make, and produces four to five quarts of sauce.  In most recipes, however, one cup of espagnole is more than enough, so that the basic recipe will yield enough sauce for 16 to 20 meals.  Frozen in small quantities, espagnole will keep practically indefinitely.

----
The following recipe, taken from ''The Cook's Decameron: A Study In Taste'', apparently dates from the late 19th century and bears no relation whatsoever to the classic espagnole as it is unthickened except for a tiny amount of flour and should only be regarded as a curiosity.

'''Ingredients'''
* Two ounces (55g) of butter
* Slices of veal, ham, bacon, beef or poultry
* Three peppercorns
* Mushroom trimmings
* One Tomato
* One Carrot
* One Onion studded with two cloves
* One diced Turnip
* Sprig Thyme, Parsley, and Marjoram
* One Teaspoon flour
* Quarter pint (150ml) Stock

'''Method'''

# Grease the bottom of a stew pan with at least two ounces of butter
# Add the slices of lean veal, ham, bacon, beef  or poultry, three peppercorns, mushroom trimmings, a tomato, a carrot and a turnip cut up, an onion stuck with two cloves, a bay leaf, a sprig of thyme, parsley and marjoram
# Braise well for 15 minutes with the lid on
# Add the stock and boil gently for 15 minutes
# Strain through a Tamis, then remove excess grease
# Cool in an earthenware vessel, and add glaze if desired
# Pass through a sieve before serving.

'''Aramba&amp;#353;i&amp;#263;i''', kraut rolls, speciality from [[w:Sinj|Sinj]], [[w:Croatia|Croatia]]

==Ingredients==
* 600 g [[Cookbook:beef|beef]] (best from the neck)
* 150 g smoked [[Cookbook:ham|ham]] or [[Cookbook:bacon|bacon]]
* 50–60 g [[Cookbook:suet|suet]] from ox kidneys
* 200 g [[Cookbook:pork|pork]]
* [[Cookbook:smoked pork|smoked pork]]
* [[Cookbook:mutton|mutton]]
* raw ham or [[Cookbook:smoked tongue|smoked tongue]]
* broth or water
* 2 large [[Cookbook:onion|onion]]s
* some [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic]]
* [[Cookbook:clove|clove]]s
* grated [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon rind]]
* [[Cookbook:salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:pepper|pepper]]
* some ground [[Cookbook:cinnamon|cinnamon]]
* 2–3 crushed cloves
* 1 grind [[Cookbook:nutmeg|nutmeg]]
* 1 head of [[Cookbook:Sauerkraut|sauerkraut]] (or fresh white of [[Cookbook:Grape Leaf|grape leaves]])

==Preparation==

# Finely chop beef, bacon, suet and pork, and place in a large bowl. Chopping the meat is better than running through a grinder, and in this way it retains more of its flavour. 
# Next add the chopped onions, garlic cloves, grated lemon rind, salt and pepper, a little cinnamon, crushed cloves and ground nutmeg.
# Mix all the ingredients well; knead together with your hands, if desired.
# Separate the leaves from the sauerkraut head, setting aside the better ones for stuffing. 
# Cut away part of the leaf stalk at the base. 
# Add a spoonful of the meat mixture to each kraut leaf. 
# Roll the Aramba&amp;#353;ici from the base of each leaf, and fold the ends together well so that they do not fall apart during cooking.
# Put 1 spoonful of grease in a deep stoneware casserole dish.
# Pack and layer the Aramba&amp;#353;ici rolls tightly next to one another in the casserole dish.
# Layer smoked meat (possibly home-made smoked ham (pr&amp;#353;ut) or smoked tongue) between the layers of kraut rolls.
# Pour the broth of water over the Aramba&amp;#353;ici, cover tightly and cook three to four hours over low heat. 
# Shake casserole form several times, but do not stir.

== Notes, tips and variations ==
* It is best to pre-cook the Aramba&amp;#353;ici in the evening, and on the following day cook until done.
* Apart from other ingredients, fresh sauerkraut is the most important for good and tasty Aramba&amp;#353;ici. 
* Aramba&amp;#353;ici is also delicious in the summer. Should you not be able to find any sauerkraut in the summer, you can also use fresh cabbage or grape leaves. Sort out the leaves and blanch them with boiling water to soften them. Fill with the Aramba&amp;#353;ici mixture and cook in the same manner as with the sauerkraut leaves.

* ½ cup (120 g)  [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]

'''Rich brownies''' are cake-like but are denser and not springy or gooey.

== Ingredients ==

*4 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounces]] (110 g) unsweetened [[Cookbook:Chocolate|baking chocolate]]
*⅔ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (160 g/1.6 dl) solid fat: [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]], [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]], or [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]].
*2 cups (450 g/2.7 dl) [[Cookbook:Superfine Sugar|baking sugar]]
*4 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]]
*1¼ (300 g/3 dl) cup [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1 cup (240 g/2.4 dl) coarsely chopped [[Cookbook:Nuts and seeds|nuts]] (½ inch / 1 cm [[Cookbook:Walnut|walnuts]] work well)

== Procedure ==

#Heat oven to 350°F/175°C.
#Melt chocolate and margarine in a double boiler, or (carefully) in a saucepan on low heat while stirring often.
#Remove from heat.
#Mix in the sugar, eggs and vanilla.
#Excluding the nuts, mix the dry ingredients with each other, and then into the wet mixture.
#Mix in the nuts.
#Spread into a 13-inch by 9-inch baking pan, or into two 8-inch by 8-inch baking pans.
#Bake for 30 minutes, or until brownies pull away from the sides of the pan.

== Notes, tips, and variations ==

* This works well with 3 tablespoons of oil in place of the solid fat. When using [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]], ⅓ cup should be about right.
* Unlike other brownie recipes which use [[Cookbook:Cocoa Powder|cocoa powder]] and fill one small pan, this recipe uses baking chocolate and fills two small pans or one large one.

'''Fudge brownies''' are dark, dense, [[Cookbook:Fudge|fudge]]-like brownies.  They contain more cocoa than cake-like brownies and as a result they are slightly more bitter and have a more &quot;dark chocolate&quot; taste.

==Ingredients==

* &amp;frac12; [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (1.2 dl) unsalted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* &amp;frac34; [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (1.8 dl) [[Cookbook:Cocoa|cocoa]]
* &amp;frac14; tsp. [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]]
* 1&amp;frac14; [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] (3 dl) [[Cookbook:Granulated sugar|granulated sugar]]
* 2 large, cold [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* &amp;frac12; [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (1.2 dl) [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]

==Procedure==

# Preheat oven to 325 &amp;deg;F/160 &amp;deg;C.
# In a saucepan, melt butter over low heat.
# Slowly stir in sugar, making sure it is completely dissolved. Stir in cocoa. Remove from heat. Add vanilla
# Stir in salt and mix until even.
# Whisk eggs together in a separate bowl, then add to the mixture and stir well.
# Add flour and stir until all of the flour is incorporated and the batter is an even color.  Stir well for at least another 50 strokes.
# Pour into a an 8&quot;&amp;times;8&quot; pan lined with aluminum foil, leaving plenty of overhang on both sides.
# Bake for about 26 minutes (the time varies depending on your pan type and your individual oven).

==Notes, tips, and variations==

* For the best results, refrigerate the brownies until they are cooled completely.  Use the foil hanging over the edges as handles to remove the baked brownies from the pan (this requires some care as the brownies are not solid at this point).  Fold the foil over the top so that the brownies are covered top and bottom with foil, and then put the whole thing in the refrigerator until cooled (feel the bottom center if you aren't sure).  This prevents the edges from overcooking while allowing the center to finish baking and cool.  If you omit this step, you may end up with an undercooked center and/or overcooked edges.

* For the real chocolate lover, crumble about 50 grams (1&amp;frac34; ounces) of a dark chocolate bar (one with about 70% cocoa content) into the batter and stir it lightly right before pouring the mixture into the baking pan.  You may need to add a few minutes to the baking time.

* Cut a brownie in half lengthwise and eat it with ice cream in the middle like an ice cream sandwich.

* Instead of adding vanilla and/or nuts, try adding about 100 grams (4 oz) of fresh raspberries; their sharpness goes very well with the richness of the chocolate. Half fill the tin with batter, sprinkle the raspberries over the mixture, then pour on the rest.

* 2 eggs
* a pinch of salt
* a teaspoon of cinnamon
* vanilla

==Procedure==

# In a large bowl beat eggs lightly to break the yokes, then mix in the shortening.
# The shortening/egg mixture should be loose, add the brown sugar and remaining liquids, mix well then add the salt to the liquid mixture.
# Mix the baking powder, soda, flour and oatmeal together in another bowl.
# Blend the liquid and solid mixes together.
# Stir in cholcolate chips and walnuts
# Make balls and place onto a pan then into an oven heated to 180°C (350°F) and let bake for between 15-20 minutes.

==Notes, tips, and variations==

* Lightly coat the nuts and chips with flour before adding to the mixture.

'''Hot milk cake''' is a traditional two-layer [[Cookbook:Cake|cake]], possibly from the [[w:Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic States]]. It can be [[Cookbook:Icing|frosted]] with [[Cookbook:Mocha icing|mocha icing]].

Hot milk cake can be fabulous, but the recipe is not for the timid.  Expect a couple attempts that fail to rise before getting it right.  Beating the eggs very well is important.

==Ingredients==
* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|c]] (240 ml) [[Cookbook:Milk|whole milk]]
* &amp;#189; cup (120 ml) [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|t]] (5 ml) [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] extract
* 2 cups (480 ml) cake [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] [or, 4 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|T]] (60 ml) [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]] + enough all-purpose flour to equal 2 cups]
* 2 tsp (10 ml) [[Cookbook:Baking powder|baking powder]]
* Pinch of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 4 large [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]s
* 2 cups (480 ml) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]

==Procedure==
# An hour before baking, take eggs and butter out of the refrigerator to reach room temperature.
# Heat together milk and butter until butter melts.  Cool to just warm.
# Add vanilla.
# If you sift the flour, do so after measuring.  Mix dry ingredients.
# In a large bowl beat the the eggs until lemon-colored &amp;mdash; this could take 5-10 minutes.
# Add sugar slowly, beating well.
# Add the dry ingredients.
# Add milk mixture very slowly, folding it in by hand toward the end.
# Divide the batter into 2 greased and floured 9 inch (230 mm) round cake pans.
# Bake about 30 minutes at 350 °F (175 °C).
# Cool on racks for 10 minutes (you may need to run a knife around the edge first) then turn out to cool.
# Frost with [[Cookbook:Mocha icing|mocha icing]], other icing, or with [[Cookbook:Strawberry|strawberries]].

'''Iced Tea''' is a sweetened beverage made from tea and organic acids, and sometimes with flavouring adjuncts.  It is popular in hot climates, usually served over ice.  Fruit juices such as red or white cranberry, grape, orange, grapefuit and passionfruit can be added in amounts ranging from 10% to 25%.

==Ingredients==
*3 [[Cookbook:tea|tea]] bags 
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Stevia|Stevia]] (pure - not cut with fillers)
*2 teaspoons citric acid crystals (or malic / tartaric / citric blends)
*4 teaspoons sugar

==Procedure==
The easiest way to make this is with a drip coffee maker.   Fill the machine with cold water and place the tea bags in the basket.  Place the Stevia, acid and sugar in the pot and place the pot in the machine.  Let it run through its cycle.  Chill the product.  This is a nectar and will make several litres of iced tea.

==To serve==
Place some ice in a tall glass and fill 80%-90% with cold water.  Pour in some iced tea nectar.  You may reduce the water and add some fruit juice if desired.

Note that this product contains virtually no sugar.  While 4 teaspoons are used in the nectar, this is diluted so much that the amount of sugar in a glass is probably less than 1/4 teaspoon.  On a hot day, it is particuarly refreshing.  While Stevia is fairly expensive, it goes a long way.  Use only pure Stevia.

==Variations==
*Lemon or lime juice can be used instead of the acid crystals.  This will make a cloudier finished product.  Use about 4 ounces.  
*Garnish with cherries, pineapple, lemon, or lime slices.

A traditional Portuguese cod dish, codfisch braz &quot;our anadar recipe ze do pipo&quot;.

==Ingredients==
* 200 [[Cookbook:Gram|g]] [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]] baked in 10 seponesoup [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]], chopped 5 g [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* 400 g [[Cookbook:Salting|salted]]/dried [[Cookbook:Cod|cod]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], and [[Cookbook:Pepper|white pepper]]
* 500 g mashed potatoes
** [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] roasted in oven white sekin for zé  do  pipo
** 100 g black [[Cookbook:Olive|olives]]
** [[Cookbook:150 sauté in oile oleve greem pepper|black pepper]] (optional olly &quot;zé do  pipo&quot;)
** [[Cookbook:Lemon juice|lemon juice]] (optional)
** [[Cookbook: 6 Eggs|eggs for mix in the codfisch in sauté]] (codfisch  a  braz)
** [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] (optional) [[Insert text]]
* [[Cookbook:Olive oil|olive oil]]

 
A real Portuguese person might say that this recipe is not ''bacalhau a' braz'', but rather ''bacalhau  a' ze'do pipo''. The Portuguese have a great number of dried/salted codfish recipes, and they are often misunderstood or confused.

==Procedure==
# Prepare the cod by leaving it for 24 hours in water, changing the water once or twice.
# After the 24 hour period is up, put the cod in a pot with milk. 
# Boil until slightly cooked, add salt and pepper. The milk will make the fish soft.
# Bake and mash the potatoes, optionally adding milk, egg, pepper and lemon juice.
# [[Cookbook:Chop|Chop]] up onions in circles and fry in pan with garlic and lots of olive oil until slightly browned.
# Preheat oven to 220 C.
# Place the cod in the center of a casserole or baking dish. 
# Surround the fish with the mashed potatoes and then cover it with the fried onion. 
# Cover the onion with a thick layer of mayonnaise and sprinkle bread crumbs all over.
# Bake until toasted on top.

Serve with a green wine (Vinho verde) from the north of Portugal.

'''Baked Oatmeal''' - excellent as breakfast (perhaps in its less-sweet variation) or a snack.

The first variation presented here tastes to me more like a dessert than a breakfast food (which the second, a modification, aims to be), although is no less delicious for that; try them both and see which you prefer.

== Ingredients ==

*3 [[Cookbook:cup|cup]]s (720g) quick-cooking [[Cookbook:oats|oats]]
*1 cup (240g) [[Cookbook:brown sugar|brown sugar]]
*2 [[Cookbook:teaspoon|teaspoon]]s [[Cookbook:baking powder|baking powder]]
*1 teaspoon ground [[Cookbook:cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
*1 cup (240ml) [[Cookbook:milk|milk]]
*1/2 cup (120g) [[Cookbook:butter|butter]] (melted)
*2 [[Cookbook:egg|egg]]s

== Procedure ==

Mix the ingredients and pour them into a 9in (20cm) pan. (They can be mixed in the pan, but it's a little tricky not to spill.) Bake at 350°F (175°C) for 40-45 (probably 45) minutes. Serve hot, cold, and with or without milk - the choice is yours.

== Variations ==

Having tried the above - the original recipe I got from a friend - I found that it didn't fit my &quot;breakfast&quot; paradigm; I modified it to this:

*3 cups (720g) quick-cooking oats (same as before)
*1/2 cup (120g) [[Cookbook:wheat flakes|wheat flakes]] (added)
*1/2 cup (120g) [[Cookbook:granulated sugar|granulated sugar]] and approximately 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:molasses|molasses]] (substituted for the brown sugar)
*2 teaspoons baking powder (same as before)
*1 teaspoon ground cinnamon (same as before)
*1/2 teaspoon salt (halved)
*1 1/2 cups (360ml) [[Cookbook:soy milk|soy milk]] (increased from 1c, changed to soy milk from availability)
*1/2 c (120ml) [[Cookbook:vegetable oil|vegetable oil]] (substituted for the butter)
*3 eggs (increased from 2)

There is no small amount of disagreement about what constitutes Welsh Rarebit. Many contend that it is just cheese on toast. At the other end of the spectrum are a variety of recipes in which the bread is steeped in beer or floated in soup. It has been said that &quot;welsh rarebit&quot; is a sort of post Act of Union joke, where Irish Rabbit is just bread, Welsh Rabbit is bread and cheese, Scottish Rabbit is bread and dripping and English Rabbit is actually rabbit. This, however, is a moderately uncontroversial recipe for Welsh Rarebit.

== Ingredients ==
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 
* 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 
* 1/2 teaspoon salt 
* 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
* 2 fl. oz. (60ml) porter (Guinness will do)
* 4 fl. oz. (120ml) double cream 
* 6 oz. (170g) grated Cheddar 
* 4 slices of toast

== Procedure ==
# In a medium saucepan over low heat, melt the butter and whisk in the flour. 
# Cook, whisking constantly for 2 to 3 minutes, being careful not to brown the flour. 
# Whisk in mustard, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper until smooth. 
# Add beer and whisk to combine. 
# Pour in cream and whisk until well combined and smooth. 
# Gradually add cheese, stirring constantly, until cheese melts and sauce is smooth; this will take 4 to 5 minutes. 
# Pour over toast and serve immediately.

* 2 L (8 cups) water
* 625 mL (2 1/2 cups) small dried white beans
* 1 large sweet onion
* 250 mL (1 cup) maple syrup
* 30 mL (2 tbsp) dark brown sugar
* 30 mL (2 tbsp) butter
* 2 mL (1/2 tsp) dry mustard
* 5 mL (1/2 tsp) ground pepper
* 5 mL (1 teaspoon) salt
* 6 slices side bacon
'''or'''
* 60 mL (1/4 cup) of bacon runoff

==Procedure==

# Wash beans and place in a saucepan with the water.  Cover and bring to a boil, check regularly.
# When water has reached the boiling point, time for 5 minutes and remove from heat.  Let sit for 1 hour, covered.
# After the hour, return beans and water to heat and bring to a simmer, still covered. Simmer for 45 minutes.
# Strain beans and water through a colander, collecting the liquids for later use in a bowl.

# Melt butter and combine with brown sugar.  Pour over the baked beans and bake, uncovered, until liquid is no longer visable.

==Notes, tips, and variations==

* You can substitute honey for the maple syrup, or molasses, maple is used for it's flavouring as much as its sweetness.
* Margarine or vegetable oil will do as well as butter for this, butter was used traditionally and is thus listed.
* This is often served with [[Cookbook:Ham | Ham]] and [[Cookbook:Sweet Cornbread | Sweet Cornbread]].

'''Duck Confit'''

== Ingredients ==
* 4 [[Cookbook:duck|duck]] leg portions with thighs attached, (about 2 pounds) excess fat trimmed and reserved
* 1 tablespoon plus ⅛ teaspoon [[Cookbook:kosher salt|kosher salt]]
* ½ teaspoon freshly ground [[Cookbook:Black Pepper|black pepper]]
* 10 [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic]] cloves
* 4 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaves]]
* 4 sprigs fresh [[Cookbook:thyme|thyme]]
* 1½ teaspoon black [[Cookbook:Pepper|peppercorns]]
* ½ teaspoon table [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
* 4 cups [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]

== Procedure ==
# Lay the leg portions on a [[Cookbook:platter|platter]], skin side down. 
# Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of the kosher salt and the black pepper. 
# Place the garlic cloves, bay leaves, and sprigs of thyme on each of 2 leg portions. 
# Lay the remaining 2 leg portions, flesh to flesh, on top. 
# Put the reserved fat from the ducks in the bottom of a glass or plastic container. 
# Top with the sandwiched leg portions. 
# Sprinkle with the remaining ⅛ teaspoon kosher salt. 
# Cover and refrigerate for 12 hours.
# Preheat the oven to 200°F (95°C).
# Remove the duck from the refrigerator. 
# Remove the garlic, bay leaves, thyme, and duck fat and reserve. 
# Rinse the duck with cool water, rubbing off some of the salt and pepper. 
# Pat dry with paper towels.
# Put the reserved garlic, bay leaves, thyme, and duck fat in the bottom of an enamelled cast iron pot. 
# Sprinkle evenly with the peppercorns and table salt. 
# Lay the duck on top, skin side down. 
# Add the olive oil. 
# Cover and [[Cookbook:bake|bake]] for 12 to 14 hours, or until the meat pulls away from the bone.
# Remove the duck from the fat. 
# Strain the fat and reserve. 
# To store the duck confit, place the duck leg portions in a container, cover with the reserved cooking fat, and store in the refrigerator. 
# Alternately, pick the meat from the bones and place it in a stoneware container. 
# Cover the meat with a thin layer of some of the strained fat. 
# The duck confit can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.

The excess oil can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator and used like [[Cookbook:butter|butter]] for cooking. The tinge of duck taste in the oil is wonderful.

A pork recipe loosely based on kerala cooking.

==Ingredients==
*500 [[Cookbook:Gram|grams]] [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]], diced
* 4 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Coconut Oil|coconut oil]] 
* 1/2 of a medium sized [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], finely sliced            
* 3 [[Cookbook:Chili pepper|green chili peppers]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]] (or ginger paste)
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] pr garlic paste
* 1 [[Cookbook:Pork|pork stock cube]]
* 3 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] ready-to-mix [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]] mash
* 4 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] [[Cookbook:Meat masla powder|meat masla powder]]

==Procedure==
#Brown the meat in two spoons of coconut oil, add 2 spoons of meat masala powder and [[Cookbook:Fry|fry]] for a minute. 
#Add a spoon of vinegar and fry for a minute more. Add a cup of water and cook till the meat is about half done.
#Sauté the sliced onions with 2 table spoon coconut oil in a wok or a suitable vessel along with the chopped chillies in medium flame.
#Add the ginger and garlic after about 4 minutes. Keep stir frying for about 3 more minutes. 
#Add 2 tea spoons of meat masala powder and mix it with the rest until the onions are translucent.
#Add the beef stock cube and 1/4 glass of water, keeping on low flame for around 4 minutes. Keep adding a bit of water as neccessary to make sure that the paste mix does not stick to the bottom of the vessel/wok.
#Add the half-cooked meat and mix well. Keep on medium flame till the meat is cooked thoroughly.
#Add 1/4 of a cup of water and the potato flakes/powder and mixture. You can vary the amount of the water/potato mix to desired thickness of the dish.
#Remove from fire and hold for 3-5 minutes before serving.

==Notes, tips and variations==
*Keep adding water as neccessary to prevent the mix from sticking to the bottom of the pan. The longer the onions are sautéed in oil in medium flame, the softer they become and the tastier they will be.
*If you can not get the mashed potato mix, thoroughly boil potatoes in water and use a spoon or a ladle to mash them.
*If you are using beef stock, there is no need to add more salt. Otherwise add salt to your taste. Beef stock may contain Mono Sodium Glutamate and hence would not be suitable for everyone.
*The chillies used in the above preperation are mild green chillies about the length of around 5 inches.
*The onions used should be the size of a tennis ball.
*You can also microwave the pork on full power (850W) for about 15 minutes, stirring at regular intervals of 5 minutes instead of cooking it.

== Ingredients ==


* 1-pound sweet potatoes
* 3/4 cup orange juice
* 1/2 cup firmly packed brown sugar
* 1/4-tablespoon wheat germ
* 1-tablespoon margarine

'''Savoiardi''' are a sponge-like cookie originally from the Aosta Valley of Italy in the Alps, once known as the Duchy of Savoy (whence its name is derived).  This Piemontese biscotti resembles [[Cookbook:Lady Fingers | lady fingers]], though they're about twice as thick.  Savoiardi also figure prominently in several desserts, including puddings and [[Cookbook:Tiramisù |tiramisu]], as they absorb liquids excellently.

== Ingredients ==

* 400[[Cookbook:Gram|g]] [[Cookbook:Self Raising Flour|self rising flour]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:White Sugar|white sugar]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]

* the [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|juice]] of 2 [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemons]]
* [[Cookbook:Powdered Sugar|powdered sugar]]
* pure [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla extract]]

== Procedure ==

# Beat the eggs, then add sugar, oil, vanilla, baking powder and lemon juice and stir til combined.
# Slowly mix in flour with a wooden spoon, continually adding until you have a very thick batter (you may need more or less flour).
# On a large flat surface, a cutting board or plate, sift powdered sugar.
# Using teaspoons, drop a walnut-sized ball of batter onto the sugar, roll into an oval over the sugar.
# Place rolls onto cookie pan covered with wax paper, cover rolls on pans with a single layer of wax paper.
# Place pans into the oven at 200°C (392°F).
# Bake between 5 and 15 minutes, until biscotti begin to golden.

== Notes, tips, and variations ==

* If you choose to buy Savoiardi in a store rather than make them be sure of the date they were made as they have a very short shelf life.

* Properly made Savoiardi should never be soft.

* Savoiardi are often enjoyed dipped in brandy and espresso coffee.

== Warnings ==

* Savoiardi absorb liquid very quickly. If too much liquid is absorbed then the cookie breaks and falls apart.

    <title>Cookbook:Red Pepper and Goat Cheese sauce</title>
    <id>39546</id>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}}

==Ingredients==
* 2 large red [[Cookbook:Bell pepper|bell peppers]]
* 2 tsp. [[Cookbook:Olive oil|olive oil]]
* 1/4 cup [[Cookbook:Wine|red wine]]
* 1-2 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]] to taste
* [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]] to taste
* [[Cookbook:Cheese|goat cheese]], 4oz. (bouchon, crottin, or generic chevre -- a traditional goat cheese, not a cow-style one)
* [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]], 1lb
* [[Cookbook:Tabasco sauce|Tabasco sauce]], to taste

==Instructions==
[[Cookbook:Skin|Skin]] and finely [[Cookbook:Chop|chop]]/[[Cookbook:Process|process]] red peppers
Place in saucepan &amp; cover with water
[[Cookbook:Crush|Crush]] &amp; add garlic (I leave the cloves in; some people may want to fish them out later)
Cover &amp; [[Cookbook:Heat|heat]] until [[Cookbook:Simmer|simmering]]
[[Cookbook:Stir|stir]] in wine and olive oil

Add basil, oregano, and Tabasco, stirring occasionally at simmer; allow sauce to begin cooking down
While you're doing this, make the pasta the usual way. Remember that the sauce only needs to take its sweet time to cook down.
Cut the rind from the goat cheese; you only want the inner part for this.
As soon as the pasta and sauce are ready, toss them, and the goat cheese, together in your serving dish. You have to do this fast, so the goat cheese will melt through the sauce and over the pasta. Stirring the goat cheese into the sauce could result in burned sauce.

''Serves 4.''

==Notes==
The above is what I made with what I had. It might be advantageous to remove the Tabasco and instead skin and process some Peppadew or habañero peppers (no more than four peppadews, no more than one habañero) with the bell peppers. If you're going to do this, though, remember that when doing something which will get hot pepper juice on your hands, you wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before touching your eyes.

It might be an interesting experiment to add [[Cookbook:Vinegar|balsamic vinegar]] to the sauce when you add the wine.

It might also be interesting to use half as much sweet white wine instead of the red wine and skip the spicy ingredients, and garnish with [[Cookbook:Pine nut|pine nuts]].

If you're interested in a prettier-looking dish, peel and process a large [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]] with the peppers.

[[Cookbook:Sausage|Sausage]] would be a good accompaniment for this dish.

'''Kurma''' is a sweet fried dough coated in a sugar syrup.

==Ingredients==
===Kurma dough===
*2 cloves [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]] (finely grated)
*1 tin (1 2/3 cups) [[Cookbook:Evaporated milk|evaporated milk]]
*2/3 tin (1 1/4 cups) [[Cookbook:Condensed milk|condensed milk]]
*2 tbsp. [[Cookbook:Coconut cream|coconut cream]]
*6 cups [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*2 tsp. [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]] powder
*1 stick (1/2 cup) [[Cookbook:butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:margarine|margarine]]
*6 dashes [[Cookbook:Angostura bitters|Angostura bitters]]

===Sugar syrup===
*2 cups [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Water|water]]

==Directions==
===Kurma dough===
#Mix flour, ginger, cinnamon, and butter in a large bowl.
#Mix evaporated milk, coconut cream, condensed milk, and Angostura bitters in a spearate bowl.
#Pour the liquid mixture into the mixture of dry ingredients a litte bit at a time. Mix until a dough forms. The dough should be &quot;tough;&quot; that is, not stretchy.
#Divide the dough into two balls. This makes it more manageable. Roll each ball out until about 1 cm thick.
#Cut dough into strips.
#Heat 1/2 cup of oil at medium-high heat. 
#Fry batches of the kurma dough. Turn often.
#Remove when golden brown on all sides.

===Sugar syrup===
#Heat sugar and water at medium heat.
#Stir so that sugar is completely wet.
#When mixture is clear, remove from heat.
#Pour over kurma, stir quickly to coat evenly.

==Notes, Tips, and Variations==
*Short, thin strips of dough work best. Fat, long peices tend to fall apart and be soft inside.
*If kurma is browning quickly and unevenly, turn heat down.

This recipe originally started as a vegetarian approximation to [[Cookbook:Paella|paella]].  It has since diverged from its resemblance to paella.

==Ingredients==
* 1 small [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] Sliced extremely thin
* 1 big [[Cookbook:Onion|Onion]] cut into chunks or sliced thin
* 1-3 [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], cut into cubes or slices
* 2-3 [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|Red bell peppers]], sliced.
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] of [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Curry Powder|curry powder]]
* 5-10 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* 2 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]]
* 2 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]]
* 1-2 tablespoon ground [[Cookbook:Chili|chili]] or [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|chili powder]]
* 1-2 pinch(es) [[Cookbook:Saffron|saffron]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Basmati rice|basmati rice]]
* 1-3 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Oregano|ground oregano]] 
* 1 can [[Cookbook:Black Bean|black beans]] 
* 1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Wine|red wine]]
* 2 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Pine Nut|pine nuts]]
* 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Caraway|caraway]]
* 1 cube [[Cookbook:Stock|vegetarian bouillon]]

==Procedure==
# Put the olive oil in very large saucepan, heat
# When oil is hot, add curry powder, potatoes, onions, red peppers, tomatoes
# Stir and fry until potatoes are nearly done
# Reduce heat, add crushed garlic, pine nuts, carraway, dried oregano, chili powder, stir
# In a separate pot (with a lid) heat 1 3/4 cup water to boil
# While waiting for water to boil, make a rice spice mix from 1 tablespoon paprika, pinch of saffron, 1 tablespoon cumin, 1 tablespoon oregano
# Mix rice spice mix with 1 cup basmati rice
# When water has begun to boil, reduce heat, add rice and rice spice mix.  Cover.  It will simmer for 20 minutes in total
# Add wine to saucepan, stir, turn heat off
# Let rice simmer for 10 minutes covered, keep rice covered
# Turn saucepan heat onto low, simmer, stirring occasionally
# Add bouillion cube to saucepan, mix
# Let rice simmer for another 10 minutes.  Stir contents of saucepan during these 10 minutes
# Turn heat off on rice
# When saucepan appears to be frying again, add rice to saucepan, stir
# When liquid is absorbed by rice, open one can black beans, add to saucepan
# Stir contents of saucepan until done
# Turn off heat.  Serve with cheese ([[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan]] or [[Cookbook:Cotija Cheese|Cotija]] work best)
# Consume remainder of bottle of red wine while eating meal.  Serves 2-4

==Variations==
===Vegan Variation===
Serve without cheese.
===Easier Variation===
This dish is easier to cook if the potatoes are left out altogether.
===Other Variations===
Most vegetables go well in this dish.  Feel free to chop up any vegetable and
throw it in the pan during the initial frying stage.

Pan fried pork chops are topped with a spicy, mushroom, and garlic sauce to make an elegant Asian inspired dish.

== Ingredients ==

* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Stock|pork broth]]
* 1 ounce dried black chanterelle [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]]
* ¼ cup [[Cookbook:Rice vinegar|rice wine vinegar]]
* 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]
* 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:honey|honey]]
* ¼ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|hot-pepper flakes]]
* 2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Sesame Oil|sesame oil]]
* 4 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], [[Cookbook:Mincing|minced]]
* 1 tablespoon minced fresh [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
* 4 boneless [[Cookbook:Pork|pork chops]], ½-inch thick

== Procedure ==

# Bring the chicken broth to a boil in a small saucepan. Add the dried mushrooms, and simmer over low heat for about 10 minutes. In a small bowl, stir together the vinegar, soy sauce, honey, and red pepper flakes. Set aside.
# Heat the sesame oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the pork chops, and brown for about 2 minutes on each side. Add the garlic and ginger; cook and stir until fragrant. Stir in the soy sauce mixture, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 5 minutes, uncovered.
# Remove the mushrooms from the pan using a slotted spoon, and slice into thin strips. Stir the mushrooms and chicken broth into the pan with the pork chops, and simmer uncovered over low heat until the sauce has reduced by about ⅓, and the pork chops are cooked through.
# To serve, place pork chops onto serving plates, and spoon mushroom sauce over them.

== Notes, tips, and variations ==

* When doubling recipe, don't double vinegar or red pepper flakes - use ⅛ more of each.
* When combining vinegar, soy sauce, honey, and red pepper flakes, let it macerate for 5 minutes, then check for balance/taste.
* Pre-brine pork (soak overnight in a salt solution).
* Add baby [[Cookbook:Bok Choy|bok choy]] (bok choy sum) or replace the mushrooms with the baby bok choy.

#Get a large bowl and mix the ground beef and stuffing together. Make sure to use your hands and combine the mixture ''well'', as this is the most important step.
#Slowly work the egg mixture into the meat and stuffing, once again making sure to combine all ingredients well.
#Pick up big ball of meat and pack in hands until you have formed a loaf.
#Place in ungreased loaf pan and place on center rack in oven for 45-55 minutes uncovered until center of meatloaf is browned. Drain excess grease off side of pan and let stand 5-10 minutes before cutting and serving.

'''Milk toast''' is a [[Cookbook:Breakfast|breakfast]] food consisting mainly of [[Cookbook:Toast|toast]]ed [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] dipped in [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]].  Milk toast was a popular food throughout the late 19th century and early 20th century, especially for young children and for the ailing, for whom the food was thought to be soothing and easy to digest. Although not as popular today, milk toast is still considered a comfort food.

==Milk toast version I==
This recipe, though of common domain, is provided in the food writer M.F.K. Fisher's book '''''An Alphabet for Gourmets''''' under the title ''MILK TOAST for the Ill, Weak, Old, Very Young, or Weary''.

{{wikipedia|Milk toast}}

===Ingredients===
* 1 [[Cookbook:Pint|pint]] (570ml) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]], part [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]] if the person is not forbidden that
* 4 slices good [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]], preferably homemade
* sweet [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], if butter is allowed
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], [[Cookbook:Black pepper|pepper]], if not a child or very ill

===Procedure===
Heat the milk to the simmering point. Meanwhile have ready 4 freshly toasted slices of bread. Butter them generously. Heat a pretty bowl, deeper than it is wide. Break the hot buttered toast into it, pour the steaming but not boiling milk over it, sprinkle a very little salt and pepper on the top, and serve at once.

==Milk toast version II==
This recipe comes from the 1918 edition of '''''The Boston Cooking-School Cook Book''''' by Fannie Farmer, a famous home-cooking author and instructor of the early 20th century.

===Ingredients===
* 1 pint [[Cookbook:Scald|scalded]] (570ml) milk
* ½ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] salt
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] butter
* 4 tablespoons cold water
* 2 ½ tablespoons bread [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 6 slices dry toast

===Procedure===
Add cold water gradually to flour to make a smooth, thin paste. Add to milk, stirring constantly until thickened, cover, and cook twenty minutes; then add salt and butter in small pieces. Dip slices of toast separately in sauce; when soft, remove to serving dish. Pour remaining sauce over all.

==Other tips==
Although both above recipes call for salt, milk toast may also be made sweet by the omission of salt and pepper and the addition, instead, of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]. Other optional ingredients for sweet versions include [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]] or a touch of [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]], but piquant and exotic ingredients should be avoided, as the primary purpose of milk toast is to provide a food soothing to the palate and to the digestion. 

[[Corn starch]] may be substituted for flour.

'''White Sauce''' is a common name (chiefly in the US and Britian) for the classic [[Cookbook:Béchamel Sauce|Béchamel Sauce]], one of the &quot;Mother Sauces&quot; of French Cuisine. In French cooking, [[Cookbook:Béchamel Sauce|Béchamel Sauce]] is rarely used on its own; it is more often used as the base for derivitave sauces or as a binder for gratinees. Béchamel's American cousin, on the other hand, is frequently used as a finished product. White sauce is generally more highly seasoned than is Béchamel, but the procedure for making both is the same.

Recipes from the 19th century and earlier often call for slowly simmering white sauce, for an hour or more, with whole onions and spices, then straining the finished sauce. Today, it is more common to use dried/ground seasonings; there is little difference in the finished product.

==Ingredients==

* ¼ cup (4 Tablespoons) unsalted butter
* ¼ cup (60g) all-purpose flour
* 2 cups (480ml) whole milk
* ¾ tsp. onion salt
* ¼ tsp. ground white pepper
* 1 tsp. ground mustard seed
* pinch fresh-ground nutmeg
* 1 bay leaf

==Procedure==
# Make a white [[Cookbook:Roux|roux]]: melt the butter in a sauce pan over medium heat until the foam subsides.  Add the flour and whisk together, still over the heat, for 2-3 minutes. The flour should lose its raw smell, but should not brown.
# Add the milk to the roux while whisking quickly but smoothly to create a smooth mixture. 
# Add the seasonings and cook over medium-low heat, stirring frequently. Simmer the sauce until it lightly coats the back of a spoon.
# Remove the bay leaf, taste and adjust for salt and pepper, and serve.

==Notes==
* A sweet white sauce can be made by replacing the seasoning items with sugar (preferably caster). Adding rum or brandy to taste will make this the sweet sauce traditionally served with Christmas pudding.
* The seasonings can be adjusted according to individual taste and the intended use: some dishes will require a more highly seasoned sauce, others a milder concoction.
* The flavor can also be altered by adding various herbs (parsley, celery leaves, thyme, etc.) along with the other seasonings. Generally additions should be strained from the sauce prior to use - straining would not apply, for instance, to traditional parsley sauce, typically served with fish, in which the green of the herb is an integral ingredient. Keep in mind that the sauce should be mildly flavored and that any additions should complement the finished dish, not overpower it.
* White sauce can be made ahead-of-time: remove from the heat and press a piece of plastic wrap onto the surface of the sauce to prevent it from forming a skin. Reheat over a low flame, stirring constantly, until it barely simmers.
* In the event that lumps have formed in your sauce, simply pour through a medium strainer before serving.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Cuisine of Italy]] | [[Cookbook:Pasta Recipes|Pasta Recipes]]

Fettuccine Alfredo is a dish of fettuccine pasta with a sauce made of cream, butter and cheese.  In popular American cooking the cream preparation is considered to be a sauce, though this is not the Italian convention.

Alfredo Sauce is rich but simple.  Because it is simple you can create many variations.  You can add such elements as green peas, asparagus tips, lemon zest, blanched bacon or proscuitto, shrimp, and even bite-sized pieces of smoked salmon.  Pretty much anything other than beef or game can be added to this basic sauce.

The tricks to making a good Alfredo are gentle cooking and a proper balance of ingredients.  The sauce should be just thick enough to coat the pasta without pooling on the bottom of the plate, but it should not be so thick as to be glue-like.  The sauce can be made in the time that it takes to bring a pot of water to the boil and cook the pasta.

Fettuccine Alfredo should be served immediately, because as it cools the large amount of fat in the sauce will congeal too much.  If it cannot be served immediately it should be made thinner in the pan than you want it when it's plated and presented.

This recipe will sauce one pound of pasta and serves 6 as a first course.

== Ingredients ==
* 1¾ cups (400 ml) heavy [[Cookbook:cream|cream]]
* 6 tbs. unsalted [[Cookbook:butter|butter]]
* 8.5 ounces (240 grams) grated [[Cookbook:Parmesan cheese|Parmesan cheese]] or [[Asagio cheese]]
* 1 tsp. [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
* fresh-ground [[Cookbook:black pepper|black pepper]]
* pinch of fresh-ground [[Cookbook:nutmeg|nutmeg]]

== Preparation ==
# Combine 1¼ cups (300ml) cream and the butter in a [[Cookbook:saute pan|saute pan]] large enough to accommodate the sauce and later the pound of pasta.  Heat over a low flame, stirring frequently, until the butter is melted and the cream comes to a bare simmer.  Remove the pan from the heat once the butter is evenly incorporated into the cream.
# Cook the pasta, draining it a little before it reaches the al dente stage.  The pasta should be slightly undercooked before being added to the sauce because it will continue to cook while the sauce is being finished.
# Drain the pasta and add it to the pan, along with the remaining ½ cup (100ml) of cream, the cheese, the salt, the nutmeg, and several grinds of the pepper mill.
# Heat the pasta and sauce over a low flame, tossing continuously, until the cheese melts into the sauce and the sauce thickens slightly, about 1 - 2 minutes.

== Notes ==
* Alfredo Di Lelio, for whom the dish is named, was a Roman innkeeper. Between the 1910s and the 1950s he owned a popular restaurant named Alfredo all'Augusteo in Piazza Augusto Imperatore in the center of the city.
* The original name of the dish, created in 1914, was ''Fettuccine al triplo burro'' (Fettuccine with triple butter).    He served it with golden forks given to him by Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks.
* Fettuccine is the traditional pasta for Alfredo and its variations because the broad noodles provide just the right platform for the rich cream and cheese.
* Fresh egg pasta is greatly preferred over dried pasta for cream and cheese sauces because the sauce clings more readily to fresh pasta than it does to dried.

==Ingredients==
* ½ c [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* ½ c [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 4 c [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 1 c [[Cookbook:Cheddar Cheese|cheddar cheese]]
* 1 c [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan]] or [[Cookbook:Monterey Jack Cheese|Monterey Jack cheese]]
* ½ tsp [[Cookbook:Cayenne pepper|cayenne pepper]], or to taste
* cooked [[Cookbook:Macaroni|macaroni]]

==Procedure==
# Make a [[Cookbook:White Sauce|white sauce]], using half cup of butter (a stick) and half a cup of flour.  
# Add 4 cups of heated milk and stir until smooth.  
# Add cheese and cayenne pepper.
# Finally, mix with a pot of cooked pasta.

==Alternate Recipe==

* 8 oz (by weight) [[Cookbook:Macaroni|elbow macaroni]]
* ½ cups [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* ¼ cups [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* ½ cups [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]] (of the chef's preference)
* 1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
* dash of dried [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]] and [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste

Fill a pot with water, and add Macaroni and salt.  Bring to boil stirring occasionally.  While waiting to boil, in pot heat milk, and grate cheese into milk.  This should create a basic cheese sauce.  If too thin, add more grated cheese, if too thick, add more milk.  

When Macaroni becomes soft (chef's discretion) drain.  Melt butter in pot and replace macaroni (without water). Stir until macaroni is completely covered.  Add 1 egg, unscrambled.  Stir until completely incorporated.  Add cheese sauce, and herbs.  Stir well, and serve hot.

''Note: There is really no &quot;right&quot; way to make marinara (everyone's Mom makes it differently). You will see many different recipes, most all are good and all have their advantages.''

''Note for advanced eaters: If you are having people to dinner on Friday, make the sauce Thursday night and then throw the whole pot in the fridge overnight. Before dinner (about when you're putting the pasta water on to boil), pull the pot out and put it on Low. What a time saver! And the overnight rest period allows amazing flavors and sweetness to form. You will be impressed.''

==Recipe I==
''Note: This is the classic expensive restaurant edition. You only live once.''

===Ingredients===
*1/2 Stick Unsalted Sweet Cream [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*1 tbsp vegatable or olive oil
*2 medium cloves garlic, crushed and chopped fine
*1/3 cup (80g) diced red onion
*1/2 tsp dried oregano (trust me)
*1/2 tsp dried crushed red pepper flakes
*1 can (28 oz - 750g) unsalted whole peeled tomatoes, reserve juice (use name brand, they're bigger and sweeter)
*1 can (6 oz - 150g) tomato paste
*1 + 1/2 tsp kosher [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] (more or less to taste)
*1 + 1/2 tsp granulated sugar
*1/2 tsp ground black pepper

===Exact, step by step preparation instructions===
#Heat a large [[Cookbook:Pot|pot]] over medium flame approximately 5 minutes, until hot.
#Add butter and oil; heat until clear (bubbling stops)
#Add onion; gently [[Cookbook:Sauteing|saute]] for 1 minute
#Reduce heat to medium-low
#Add garlic; gently saute for 1 minute
#Add tomato juice.
#Add tomatoes, one at a time, crushing completely using your hands (watch for spurts)
#Add oregano and red pepper flakes
#Stir to combine;
#Cover and reduce heat to low.  Simmer for 10-15 minutes.
#Add 1 tsp salt and sugar, black pepper, and tomato paste; Stir until paste is incorporated
#Cover and simmer for 10 minutes
#Taste and season accordingly. You do not want the sauce to be salty, just not unsalty. You do not want the sauce to be sweet, just not sour. Season by adding the remaining salt and sugar a little at a time, stirring completely between tastes.
#Serve over ''[[Cookbook:Al Dente|al dente]]'' spaghetti with a side of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian]] [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausage]] or [[Cookbook:meatball|meatballs]] and a deep sweet [[Cookbook:Red Wine|red wine]] ([[w:merlot|merlot]]); serves 4, make this for two and enjoy again tomorrow night!

==Recipe II==
''Note: This is a more rustic and less &quot;Italian-American&quot; recipe than the previous one.''

===Ingredients===

*2 tablespoons (app.) almond oil
*1 half of a head of garlic (less is acceptable) minced
*2 tablespoons dried oregano

*1 large can crushed tomatoes
*1/2 cup (120ml) , plus as needed, white table wine

===Preparation===
#Sweat onion, garlic, and bell pepper in extra virgin olive and oil oil with salt and pepper in oversized pan
#Deglaze pan with white wine
#Add tomatoes
#Combine dried herbs and red pepper flakes in mortar and pestel
#Add dried herbs, red pepper flakes, and unreserved fresh basil to pan
#Simmer for an hour (or more if necesary), stirring ocasionally.

#Add salt and pepper to taste
#Strain and add al dente pasta (long strand pastas such as spaghetti, linguini, and fetuccini are traditional in America but other pastas are also advisable) to pan with sauce and combine using tongs
#Plate and garnish with fresh basil and freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano

'''Thai Green Curry''' (''Khaeng Keaw Wan'')

==Ingredients==
* 1 tbsp [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]]
* 2 tbsp [[Cookbook:Curry Paste|green curry paste]] (according to taste)
* 1 tbsp soft dark brown [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1-2 thick stalks [[Cookbook:Lemongrass|lemongrass]], fat ends bashed with a rolling pin (optional)
* 750g/1½lb skinless, boneless [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]], cut into chunks (use breast and/or leg meat)
* 6-8 [[Cookbook:Kaffir Lime Leaf|kaffir lime leaves]], torn into pieces (if unavailable, use the grated zest of 1 lime)
* 400ml/14fl oz [[Cookbook:Coconut Milk|coconut milk]]
* good shake of Thai [[Cookbook:Fish Sauce|fish sauce]] or light [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]
* small handful of [[Cookbook:Cilantro|coriander]] (Cilantro), roughly chopped
* ½-1 [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]], juice only

== Procedure ==
# Heat the oil in a wok or large frying pan. 
# Add the green curry paste and sugar and cook over a fairly high heat for about a minute, stirring with the lemongrass, if using. 
# Reduce the heat slightly and stir in the chicken pieces and lime leaves or zest until coated in the paste. 
# Add the coconut milk, fish sauce or soy sauce and bring to a simmer, cooking for 25-30 minutes until thickened slightly. 
# Stir in the coriander and lime juice. 
# Check for seasoning, adding more fish sauce or soy sauce if needed.

The curry is now best left to sit for a few minutes so the sauce becomes creamier. You will also taste the true flavours of the curry paste ingredients when it's slightly cooler. Serve with lots of fragrant Thai jasmine rice.

==Tips and Variations==
* For caramel custard add to eggs 4 tablespoons of [[Cookbook:Caramel Sauce|caramel sauce]].

* A [[Cookbook:Meringue|meringue]], or frosting for the top, requires about a tablespoonful of fine sugar to the beaten white of one egg; to be placed on the top after the custard or pudding is baked, smoothed over with a broad-bladed knife dipped in cold water, and replaced in the oven to brown slightly.

*[[Cookbook:Applesauce|Applesauce]] or [[Cookbook:Quince|quince]] preserves can be placed in the bottom of the dish before baking. When set, add some more quince or apple sauce (heated) on the top with some chopped [[Cookbook:Almond|almonds]] and serve hot.  When starting with fresh fruit, stew it (optionally, with sugar to taste), flavoring with the rind of a half [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]], and pass it through a [[Cookbook:Sieve|sieve]], or use a [[Cookbook:Food Processor|food processor]].  The resulting puree can be decorated with some thin lemon peel cut into stars.

*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbs]] chopped fresh [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]] (coriander leaves)
*4 large cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], finely [[Cookbook:Chop|chopped]]
*1-4 chopped fresh red [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chillis]] (depending on strength of the Chillis and the desired strength of the marinade)
*2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsps]] [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsps]] [[Cookbook:Garam Masala|garam masala]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]] powder
*1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] (use rock salt for best results)

==Procedure==
#Add all of the ingredients except the chicken to a non-metalic [[Cookbook:Mixing Bowl|mixing bowl]] and mix well.
#Add the chicken and mix until fully coated.
#Ideally, the chicken should now be left in a refrigerator to [[Cookbook:Marinating|marinate]] for at least 24 hours. It may not be safe to leave chicken which has previously been frozen for longer than 24 hours, but fresh chicken should be left to marinate for 48 hours for best results. If you do not wish to leave the chicken to marinate, simply continue to the next step.
#The chicken now needs to be cooked. For best results, place on skewers and cook in a [[Cookbook:Tandoor|tandoor]] or ceramic pot oven. The chicken can also be cooked on skewers under a medium [[Cookbook:Grilling|grill]] for 5 minutes on each side or barbecued (cooking times depend on the temperature of the barbecue). Always ensure the chicken is cooked throughout before serving.
#Serve with [[Cookbook:Naan|naan bread]], with [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] or use in a [[Cookbook:Chicken Tikka Masala|Chicken Tikka Masala]].

==Notes, tips and variations==
*[[Mustard seed oil]] is considered unfit for human consumption in many parts of the world and is therefore not available. A poor alternative can be made by ''[[crackling]]'' 1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] of [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]] seeds in approximately 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbs]] of very hot [[Cookbook:Vegetable Oil|vegetable]] or [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]. Allow to cool then use in place of mustard seed oil.
*It is possible to make a tikka with almost any meat, the most commonly used other than chicken being [[Cookbook:Lamb|lamb]] and [[Cookbook:Mutton|mutton]].
*Tikka can be served either as main meal or as an appetiser.
*Powdered or dried ingredients can be substituted for fresh, but at the expense of taste.
*Some people prefer to make tikka with meat on-the-bone for improved flavour.

'''Chicken Tikka Masala''' is probably the most popular [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] dish in the world. Its popularity has proven so great that almost every Indian restaurant worldwide now offers it.{{fact}} It has conquered even the Indian subcontinent, and has arguably replaced [[Cookbook:Tandoori Chicken|Tandoori Chicken]] as the flagship of Indian food. This is ironic as the dish is in fact a dish originating from Bangladeshi immigrants living in England sometime in the 1970s.

==Ingredients==
*675 [[Cookbook:g|g]] (1.5 [[Cookbook:Pound|lb]]) cooked [[Cookbook:Chicken Tikka|Chicken Tikka]]

*4 large cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], finely [[Cookbook:Chopping|chopped]]
*200 [[Cookbook:g|g]] (7 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]]) [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], finely chopped (optional)
*1 tin (can) of plum [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], chopped
*1-4 chopped fresh green [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chillis]] (depending on strength of the Chillis and the desired strength of the sauce)

*50 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]] (4 [[Cookbook:Fluid Ounce|fl oz]]) single [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbs]] malt [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbs]] curry paste
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbs]] [[Cookbook:Tandoori masala|tandoori masala paste]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbs]] [[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomato paste]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbs]] [[Cookbook:Garam Masala|garam masala]]

==Procedure==
#Heat the oil in a [[Cookbook:Wok|wok]] (if available, otherwise a large [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]]).
#Add the garlic and onions (if using) and [[Cookbook:Stir-frying|stir-fry]] until browned.
#Add the curry pastes and mix well, adding a little water or yogurt.
#Add the cooked chicken tikka and [[Cookbook:Stir-frying|stir-fry]] for two minutes to heat through.
#Add the tomatoes, vinegar, tomato paste and chillies and [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]] for five minutes. Add more water if required.
#Add the cream, garam masala and chopped cilantro and [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]] for a few minutes.
#Garnish with fresh coriander and serve with [[Cookbook:Naan|Naan bread]], [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] coloured yellow with [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]], [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]] [[Cookbook:Bahjis|bahjis]] and/or a good glass of white [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]].

==Notes, tips and variations==

'''Meringue''' is sweetened, whipped [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] white that has been cooked.  It forms the top of desserts such as [[Cookbook:Lemon Meringue Pie|lemon meringue pie]], in which case it is browned on top but remains soft in the center.  It is also a predominant characteristic of a [[Cookbook:Pavlova|Pavlova]].  Baked at lower heat for a longer time, it dries to form a crunchy confection ([[Cookbook:Meringues|meringues]]), and can be eaten on its own.

'''Meringues''' are crunchy confections made from whipped egg whites and sugar. In Germany and Austria (but not in France) they are called ''Baiser'' (from French kiss). Served with whipped cream, they are a traditional dessert in the canton of Bern in Switzerland. See our [[Cookbook:Meringue|meringue]] page for similar uses of whipped egg whites.

==Ingredients==
* whites of 4 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (250ml) [[Cookbook:Superfine Sugar|superfine sugar]] [[Cookbook:Powdered Sugar|powdered sugar]] or [[Cookbook:Granulated sugar|granulated sugar]]. Ideal is a mixture of 50% superfine and 50% powdered sugar.
* 2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] of [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]
* ¼ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] extract, if desired

==Procedure==
 
# Beat whites of eggs until stiff and dry.
# Add lemon juice
# Gradually add sugar and continue beating until mixture holds shape and is very shiny. Test if the sugar is wholly solved and no grains remain (this can take longer or shorter depending on the sugar used).
# Add vanilla. 
# Drop by spoonfuls on unglazed paper
# Bake in slow oven 80 to 90 minutes, depending on size. Use very low heat, meringues should rather dry than bake and should be dry and only very slightly colored, when finished.
# Let cool, before serving
# In the original Swiss recipe, two meringues per serving are filled with sweetened whipped [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]], but the cream is often supplemented with [[Cookbook:Strawberry|strawberries]] or other fresh fruits and [[Cookbook:Vanilla Ice Cream|vanilla ice cream]]

== Tips and Variations ==

# The tiniest bit of egg yolk or fat prevents the egg white to get stiff
# Meringues are more decorative if shaped with a pastry bag
# Another method of baking is, to preheat the oven and bake the meringues 2-3 minutes at moderately hot temperature, then turn down the oven completely and keep it shut for 8 hours.
# Meringues do not turn out very well, if the air is very humid (due to climate or due to steam from other cooking)

'''Microwave Chocolate Pudding''' is a pudding made with sugar, milk, unsweetened cocoa powder and thickened with cornstarch. It is prepared in a microwave. 

==Ingredients==

* 1/3 cup (80g) granulated sugar or &quot;Splenda&quot; sugar substitute
* 1/4 cup (60g) unsweetened cocoa powder
* 3 Tb cornstarch
* 1/8 tsp salt
* 2 cups (480ml) of whole, 2%, 1%, or skim milk. Soy milk may also be used.
* 1 tsp of vanilla extract or imitation vanilla

==Preparation==
# In a 1-qt microwave safe bowl (not metal), mix the dry ingredients (sugar, cocoa, cornstarch and salt).
# Add cold milk and mix well with small wisk or electric mixer until all the cocoa lumps are disolved.
# Microwave in bowl, on high for 3-minutes. Stir well.
# Microwave on high for an additional 4 to 6 minutes, stirring after each minute of cooking.
# Remove from Microwave and stir in Vanilla.

'''Potato Salad''' is able to trace its origins to Germany before the turn of the 17th century, where it first became popular to use vinegar and spices on the potato as side to a meal.  The salad has a bite to it and is served warm as often as not.

== Ingredients ==

* 2 [[Cookbook:Pound | pounds]] (~1kg) of [[Cookbook:Potato | potatoes]] 
* 6 slices of [[Cookbook:Bacon | bacon]]
* 1/2 cup (120g) of onion
* 2 tablespoons of [[Cookbook:Sugar | sugar]]
* 1/2 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Celery seed | celery seed]]
* 2 hard boiled [[Cookbook:Egg | eggs]]
* 1/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (60g) [[Cookbook:Flour | flour]]
* 1/2 cup (120ml) of [[Cookbook:Vinegar | vinegar]]
* 1 cup (240ml) of [[Cookbook:Water | water]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] of fresh [[Cookbook:Parsley | parsley]]
* 1 1/2 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt | salt]]
* [[Cookbook:Pepper | pepper]]
* [[Cookbook:Paprika | paprika]]

== Procedure ==

# Cook bacon strips, cut into small pieces and set aside for later.
# Boil potatoes for 5-10 minutes, or until softened and cut into small chunks.
# Place potatoes in a large bowl and let them come to room temperature.
# In a bowl combine flour, celery seed, parsley, salt and pepper.
# Pour the water and vinegar into a pot, stir in sugar. Add the dry mixture and stir until thick.
# In the original bowl place potatoes and bacon, pour on thick mixture.
# Break apart eggs and stir lightly into the bowl to combine. 
# Place in large serving bowl and sprinkle with paprika. 
# Serve

== Notes, tips, and variations ==

* Can be served chilled or warm to preference.

* Chopping the potatoes into small pieces allow more surface to be coated and improves the flavor.

Basic recipe on how to cook artichokes.  Similar results can be obtained using the [[Cookbook:Steamed Artichoke|steamed artichoke recipe]], however, using the [[Cookbook:Microwave oven|microwave oven]] is much faster.

==Ingredients==
*1 medium [[Cookbook:Artichoke|artichoke]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]], juiced
*[[Cookbook:Water|Water]]
*;Seasonings (optional)
**[[Cookbook:Parsley|Parsley]]
**1-2 [[Cookbook:Garlic|Garlic]] cloves per artichoke
**[[Cookbook:Pepper|Pepper]]
**1/8 cup (30 ml) white [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]].

==Procedure==

#Cut off top 1/3 of the artichoke, and all but 1 inch of the stem.
#Remove base leaves and cut off the tips of the higher leaves.
#Sprinkle artichoke with lemon juice to preserve color.
#Place artichoke stem up in a microwave safe dish tall enough to place lid without touching the artichoke.
#Fill dish with 1 inch (3 cm) of water and any of the optional seasonings.
#Cover and microwave on high for 6-8 minutes, and allow to rest for 1-2 minutes.  The artichoke is cooked when a [[Cookbook:Paring knife|paring knife]] can be inserted into the heart without resistence.
#Remove artichoke from the dish and place upside down to drain.
#Serve whole, with one or more dips. Diners should remove a leaf, dip the base of the leaf in the dip, and eat the fleshy base of the leaf.
#When all the leaves are gone, remove the choke, cut the heart of the artichoke into bite sized pieces, and serve with the dip.

'''Waldorf Salad''', created by Oscar Tschirky in 1890 at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, New York, New York, in the United States of America.

== Ingredients ==

* 1 large grannie smith apple
* 1 large red delicious apple
* 1 tablespoon of lemon juice
* 1/3 cup (80g) of raisins
* 1/3 cup (80g) of chopped walnuts
* 1/3 cup (80g) of chopped celery
* 2 tablespoons of mayonnaise
* 1 tablespoon of [[Cookbook:Sugar | sugar]]
* 6 large leaves of lettuce
* 10 halved maraschino cherries

== Procedure ==

# Slice the apples into wedges, place in a bowl.
# Pour lemon juice on the apple wedges, and ensure a light coating to prevent browning.
# Plumpen the raisens by placing them in warm water for 5 minutes, drain well.
# Mix celery, plumpened raisens and walnuts into the bowl of apple wedges.
# Mix the mayonnaise and sugar together, then pour into the apple mixture, ensure a light coating on all items.
# Chill for at least 30 minutes
# Place three lettuce leaves on a large plate and three on another, place half of the mixture on each set of leaves, sprinkle 5 cherries on each salad.
# Serve

== Notes, tips, and variations ==

* Though the original salad only used apples, celery and mayonnaise; walnuts mixed in have become an integral part of the modern version of the salad and cherries are only used as a sweet addition to further the contrasts within the salad.

Instead of raisins, try using grapes to create the same sort of taste but more wholy and not as rich.

=Apple Raisin Oat Muffins=
[[Cookbook:Muffins|Muffins]] are one of many traditional breakfast [[Cookbook:Quickbreads|quickbreads]]; unlike [[Cookbook:Biscuits|biscuits]], muffins usually contain some form of fruit or other [[Cookbook:Garnish|garnish]].  These muffins are especially healthy because they are made with [[Cookbook:Whole Wheat|whole wheat]] [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] and [[Cookbook:Oats|oats]].  See the notes at the bottom of the recipe for ideas about how to customize this muffin recipe to your own tastes; the basic proportions should work for any flavor of oat muffin.

==Ingredients==
*1.5 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (360 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Whole Wheat|whole wheat]] [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]

*1 [[Cookbook:Eggs|whole egg]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (240 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]], whole or 2%
*0.33 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (80 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Canola Oil|vegetable oil]] (your favorite is fine)
*2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (480 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Apple|apple]], grated (Granny Smith is an excellent choice)
*2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] (10 mL) [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*0.5 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] (2.5 mL) [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]]
*0.5 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] (2.5 mL) [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] (5 mL) [[Cookbook:Vanilla extract|vanilla extract]]
*0.25 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (60 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]]

==Equipment==
*Large [[Cookbook:mixing bowl|mixing bowl]]
*Smaller mixing bowl
*[[Cookbook:Measuring cups|Measuring cups]]
*[[Cookbook:Measuring spoons|Measuring spoons]]
*[[Cookbook:Muffin pan|Muffin pan]](s)

==Procedure==
#Preheat oven to 425&amp;nbsp;°F (220&amp;nbsp;°C)
#Grease muffin pans with cold [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]], or pan spray
#In a large bowl, thoroughly combine flour, oats, baking powder and baking soda
#In a smaller bowl, thoroughly combine eggs, sugar, milk, oil, apple, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, vanilla and raisins
#Add wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix ''with bare hands'' until just combined.  '''Do not overmix!'''
#Fill muffin cups about three-quarters full, then place on oven's upper rack and turn the oven down to 375&amp;nbsp;°F (190&amp;nbsp;°C)
#Turn muffin pans 180° after 10 minutes; check for doneness after 15 minutes
#Muffins usually take 20 to 25 minutes to cook completely
#Allow to cool briefly (2-5 minutes) before removing from pan

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*'''Optional variations:''' use [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]] instead of apple, or dried [[Cookbook:Cranberry|cranberries]] or other dried [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]] instead of the raisins.

==Warnings==
*Overmixing will lead to ''worming'', which is caused by [[Cookbook:Gluten development|gluten development]].  You will see this as vertical tunnels running through your muffins, much like a worm might leave.

This delicious sour cream and onion dip will bring back memories of carefully emptying a dried soup envelope into a tub of sour cream and gently trying to push the salty mass into the center so you can stir it without choking on instant soup dust. This recipe delivers richer, fresher flavor. Eat it with potato crisps.

==Ingredients==
*&amp;frac12; medium [[Cookbook:onion|onion]] (white or yellow), minced
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:vegetable oil|vegetable oil]]
*1 Instant vegetable bouillion cube (enough to make 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] of bouillion)
*&amp;frac14; cup water
*1 cup [[Cookbook:sour cream|sour cream]]
*&amp;frac12; [[Cookbook:teaspoon|teaspoon]] onion powder
*[[Cookbook:salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:pepper|pepper]] to taste

==Procedure==
In a small saucepan, [[Cookbook:Sweating|sweat]] the onion gently with a pinch of salt and pepper until it becomes transparent. Then, increase heat and saute&amp;eacute;e until the onion becomes golden-brown and forms a sticky mass. Add the water and bouillion cube (crushed) and simmer until some of the water has evaporated and the liquid is thick. Remove the pan from the heat and add the sour cream--stir until smooth. Add the onion powder and taste. Add salt and pepper if desired. Refrigerate before serving. Makes about 1&amp;frac12; cups.

==Ingredients==

* Sushi rice (all of it prepared directly beforehand)
* Fish/vegetables (this may consist of either raw/smoked [[Cookbook:Salmon|salmon]], [[Cookbook:Tuna|tuna]], etc or perhaps [[Cookbook:Cucumber|cucumber]] or [[Cookbook:Avocado|avocado]])
* Sheets of [[Cookbook:Nori|nori]] (red algae [[Cookbook:Seaweed|seaweed]] paper). 
* You must also have a makisu or [[Cookbook:Sushi Roller|sushi roller]] (bamboo sticks strung together with string)
* Wasabi paste, powders should say how to make them into paste.
* Water
* Plastic wrap, if making inside-out rolls with rice on outside
* Sesame seeds, if making inside-out rolls with rice on outside (optional)

==Instructions==

#Take the roller and place it on top of a cutting board.  If making inside out rolls with rice on the outside, make sure your makisu (roller) is completely wrapped in a double layer of plastic wrap. this task is simple and effective in keeping rice from sticking to where it shouldn't and especially sanitation. Finally, put a sheet of nori shiny side down on top of the makisu.  lengthwise or longwise depends both on the roll and amount of ingredients are being rolled.
#Dampen your hands before applying the rice.  This will prevent clumping and the rice sticking to your hands, but may also make the rice less sticky, so don't go overboard.  Grab the rice with one hand and put a fistful on the center of the nori.  When spreading this, leave a 2 centimeter gap on the side parallel to the bamboo.  As a general rule, if you can't see the nori through the rice, you have too much. A 6mm layer has been recommended.
#If making an inside out roll, flip over the nori and rice quickly onto the makisu. So as the rice is now on the surface of the mat and the nori is facing you.
#Next place the primary ingredients in a row in the middle. Then, slowly use the roller to push the nori against itself (rolling it away from you), using your thumbs and heels of hands for stability. Be careful when you reach the row of ingredients, making sure that it goes underneath the roll rather than just being pushed along.
#When you reach the end of the nori sheet, use the roller to compact the roll a little, making sure the rice is making it all stick together. Trying to even out a bumpy roll is simple, and it's really just a matter of hand pressure. Don't squeeze too hard on the sides and don't flatten the roll from the top.  If you want to fix the ends of the roll, just poke about 1/2 an inch out from one side of mat and while gently holding it in place, press it with the heel of your hand a little. 
#Next remove the maki from the sushi roller, and put it on the cutting board below.  
#Before you cut, wet your knife every time to reduce sticking (don't do it sparingly this time).  This can be done using a sink, a large bowl, or a large plastic cup.  A knife with dimples supposedly works well for cutting sushi.  Slice the rolls from the inside out, into sections of 5, 6, or 8 (depending on roll).  Cutting from the inside first will ensure that all ingredients that shift shift towards the outside two pieces. For the rolls of 6 or 8, cut from the center, then put one roll behind the other, and cut each half in half.  If you were making an inside-out roll, you may wish to put on a line of sesame seeds primarly for garnish.
#Serve with soy sauce and something shallow for dipping.  You may also want chopsticks, pickled ginger, and wasabi if culture allows.  Sashimi, Miso soup, other sushi, or just general japanese food is also often served alongside it.  Green Tea is considered the drink of choice to have with sushi.

==Things to remember about guest habits==
Don't be surprised if someone asks for wasabi with their soy sauce.  Although this might be rare or offensive in your culture, it's very common in north american and european cultures.  Also don't be surprised if someone eats it without chopsticks.  This is also very common, this time in east asia.  Sushi was originally designed to be eaten that way, until someone discovered how yummy soy sauce made it taste, reducing its portability.  It's a clean way to eat maki (not for other types of sushi), you don't need to eat them with a fork or chopsticks.  This phenomenon is similar to some cultures eating pizza with their hands, others with a fork and knife.  It can be seen as unnecessary and idiotic, two good ways to eat food, or the sanitary and polite way.

==Common sushi rolls==

{{recipe}}

All [[Cookbook:Sushi|sushi]] has rice in it, but not all sushi uses ''nori'' as a wrapper. ''Inarizushi'' (&quot;stuffed sushi&quot;) encloses the rice and filling in a pocket made of paper-thin [[Cookbook:Omelet|omelet]], [[Cookbook:Frying|fried]] [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]], or a [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]] leaf. What follows is the recipe for an omelet wrapper.

==Ingredients==
* 4 extra-large [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* 2 teaspoons (8 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Sake|sake]]
* 1 teaspoon (4 mL) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1/8 teaspoon (1/2 mL) [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 teaspoon (4 mL) [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]]
* 1 tablespoon (12 mL) cold water

==Utensils==
* mixing bowl
* mixing cup, for the cornstarch thickener
* [[Cookbook:Makiyakinabe Pan|makiyakinabe pan]] (a Japanese rectangular omelet pan), or a regular frying pan

==Instructions==
* Break the eggs into the bowl. Removing the egg white clinging to the yolk will make for a smoother and more uniform surface.
* Add the sake, sugar, and salt.
* Beat the mixture to produce a smooth, consistent texture, but not so much as to create a foam. If you accidently get air bubbles, let the bowl sit for a few minutes while they pop.
* Dissolve the cornstarch in the water &amp;mdash; it will be closer to a paste than a fluid &amp;mdash; and then add it to the egg mix.
* Heat the pan over medium heat. If you are not using a non-stick pan, you will need to oil the surface.
* Pour three or four tablespoons (40 to 50 mL) of the egg mixture all at once onto the pan.
* Swirl the pan to spread the mixture thinly and evenly.
* Allow the mixture to cook until the edge start to dry out. Remove the pan from the heat, and let the egg mixture continue to cook for 30 seconds from the heat in the pan.
* Flip the omelet over and return the pan to the heat for 30 seconds.
* Remove the omelet from the pan, and allow it to cool.

You can store these omelets in the refrigerator for a few days.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}}

==Ingredients==
* sushi rice
* topping
* wasabi (as needed)
* nori (as needed)

==Procedure==
* For nigirizushi requiring a band of nori to hold the sushi together, cut the nori into strips about 1/4 inch wide and long enough to wrap around the finished sushi with at least 1 inch of overlap.  Place one such strip on the preparing surface.
* Hand form the sushi rice into suitable sized sushi bases.  Generally, this means a rectangular block from 1/2 inch to 1 inch wide, 1 inch to 1 1/2 inch long, and 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch high.  It takes considerable experience to form pleasing sushi bases by hand (beginners may find a plastic sushi mold helpful for forming the bases).  Wetting the hands in water prior to forming each sushi base keeps the rice from sticking to the hands.
* For nigirizushi requiring wasabi between the rice and topping, add a small dab of wasabi on the rice.
* Add the selected topping on top of the sushi rice.
* If nori is used, wrap one of the nori band ends up and over the nigirisushi topping firmly, so that it sticks to the rice and topping.  Wet the other nori band end with a small amount of water, and wrap it up and over the topping so that it overlaps the other nori end.  The water causes the nori ends to stick together.

==Common nigirizushis==
* Broiled eel: sushi rice, broiled eel, nori band. Top with eel sauce and bonito and/or sesame seeds.
* Salmon: sushi rice, salmon.
* Shrimp: sushi rice, shrimp.  Clean and butterfly the shrimp prior to using.
* Mackerel: sushi rice, mackerel.

'''Gunkanmaki''' (battleship roll)

==Ingredients==
* Sushi rice
* Topping
* [[Cookbook:Nori|Nori]]

== Procedure ==
# Cut nori into strips 1 inch wide and long enough to surround the desired sushi rice piece with at least 1 inch of overlap.
# Form the sushi rice into oval pieces.  A common size would be 1&quot; wide, 1 1/4&quot; inch long, and 1 inch high.  
# Start with one end of the nori band and surround the rice piece.  Wet the inside of the other end of the nori and press over the first end.  The nori will stick together this way.

==Common gunkanmakis==

* Uni (''sea urchin'') roe (eggs): roll sushi rice in nori.  Cut into serving sizes and stand up, add sea urchin roe on the top of each piece.

* Quail egg:  Form a small nugget of sushi rice.  The nugget should be approximately 1-1/4 inches long and 3/4 inches wide and 0.5 inches high (3.2 cm x 1.9 cm x 1.3 cm).  Take a piece of nori and cut it into a strip approximately 1-1/4 inches wide (3.2 cm) and 4.5 inches long (11.5 cm).  Roll the nugget in the nori.  The nori should create a band around the circumference of the nugget.  The band will be taller than the nugget and will thus form a cup-shape, where the nugget is the base of the cup and the nori is the sides of the cup.  Fill one side of the cup with fish roe (orange fish eggs) and fill the other side of the cup with one quail egg.  Serve and enjoy.

== Introduction ==

One of my favorite Filipino dishes, this is quickly and easily prepared on a stovetop or can be made in a crock pot for a more traditional version.  I generally do not use a recipe for this dish, but rather change the proportions depending on my mood that evening.  This recipe's mutability is its finest feature, so feel free to use this recipe as a basic guideline.

== Ingredients ==

* 4 [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] leg &amp; thigh(This is the only &quot;must have&quot;, breast just doesn't taste and feel as good!)
* 8 tsp &quot;suka&quot; vinegar made from coconut juice (as a  variant, try balsalmic vinegar)
* 8 tsp [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]
* 1 finely sliced [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* 4 smashed cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* 1 whole sweet bay leaf or laurel
1/2 tsp. freshly cracked (not grond) black pepper corns

== Preparation ==

1.Sear the chicken in a pan,  Brown the thighs on all sides, but don't worry about cooking them through, this step is basically just for taste and texture.  

2.Turn down the heat and add some oil, brown the garlic, add in onions. when this softens. Add vinegar. Remember not to stir or cover the pan until the vinegar boils.This will ruin your adodo.
If you make a mistake stirring the adobo while uncooked, it will create a sour and bitter after taste.

3.After the vinegar has simmered, add in the soy sauce and bay leaf and pepper.

4.Cook until it has dried a bit.
Real adobo should not be saucy.

Serve over hot steamed rice.

'''Idiyappam''' (rice noodles) is a South Indian food, usually served for breakfast.

==Ingredients==
* 1 cup raw [[Cookbook:Rice Flour|rice flour]] (i.e. not roasted flour)
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Water|water]] (hot water preferred by some)
* ½ cup [[Cookbook:Grater|grated]] [[Cookbook:Coconut|coconut]]
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Ghee|ghee]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste 
 
== Procedure ==
# Mix rice flour with hot water, ghee and salt 
# Knead it into a smooth dough. 
# Fill it in an idiyappam presser/sieve and press it onto banana leaves on which a little grated coconut has been sprinkled, or press it directly onto an [[Cookbook:Idli Pan|idli pan]] without banana leaves.
# Steam for 5-10 minutes. Some people add a little grated coconut on top before steaming.

Idiyappams may be served with egg curry or brown chickpea (kadala) curry. In some places it is eaten dipped in fresh coconut milk mixed with sugar.

'''Rasam''', also '''Saru''', is a popular dish in South India. It can be described as a thin soup, served on top of rice. 

==Ingredients==
===Dhal===
* 14g (1/2oz) [[Cookbook:Toovar dhal|toovar dhal]] (also called red gram dhal)
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Oil|cooking oil]]
* 3 [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
* 1 or 2 teaspoons of [[Cookbook:Tamarind|tamarind paste]]
* Salt
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] ([[Cookbook:Jaggery|jaggery]] or [[Cookbook:Palm Sugar|palm sugar]] is good too)
* [[Cookbook:Water|water]] - the amount depends on the amount of Rasam required. It is meant to be very watery.

===Rasam Powder===
* 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander seeds]]
* 3 to 4 [[Cookbook:Chili|dried red chillies]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin seeds]]
* A small pinch of [[Cookbook:Asafoetida|asafoetida]]

To prepare Rasam powder: Fry the all the ingredients together, adding asafoetida last, in a pan with two teaspoons of oil or ghee. Roast  until the spices start to brown slightly, and powder the ingredients. (Coriander seed is very difficult to powder)

===Mustard Seed seasoning===
* 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Ghee|ghee]] (or butter and oil) 
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Mustard|black mustard seeds]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Urad Dal|urad dhal]] ([[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin seeds]] may also be used)
* 2 [[Cookbook:Chili|dried red chillies]]
* 4 [[Cookbook:Curry Leaf|curry leaves]]
* A handful of chopped [[Cookbook:Cilantro|coriander leaves]] (cilantro)

==Procedure==

# Wash the toovar dhal thoroughly, until the water runs clear.
# Cover with double the quantity of water, turmeric powder and teaspoon of oil. Cook in a microwave for half an hour, a pressure cooker, or slowly on a stove, covered. The dhal should turn out a mushy consistency.
# Cut the tomatoes into four pieces, put them in a saucepan full of water and bring to the boil.
# Add tamarind, salt and teaspoon of sugar. The tamarind is usually very bitter, so add only a little at a time. Tamarind can be added later to adjust the flavour.
# When the tomatoes are half cooked add the cooked dal.
# Add enough Rasam powder to give the desired taste, usually 4 or 5 teaspoons. It should be reasonably spicy, and neither the tamarind or sugar should dominate. Stir and keep simmering.
# In a small pan, heat the ghee for the mustard seed seasoning and add the mustard seeds, urud dhal, chillies and curry leaves. The urud dhal should start to go brown and the mustard seeds will start spitting. Don't burn any of the spices - it's easy to do. Once cooked, pour the seasoning  into the rest of the rasam straight away and stir it through. 
# Add chopped coriander leaves. Serve with hot and soft plain boiled rice.

==Bread Making==

===French Style Baking===
:The French are renowned for their [[Cookbook:Artisan bread|artisan breads]]. By using the four basic ingredients of water, flour, [[Cookbook:yeast|yeast]], and salt, the French have mastered the art of creating complex breads that vary widely, despite the fact that each loaf contains the same ingredients.  French law dictates that for “French” style breads, only the four above-mentioned ingredients may be used, along with ascorbic acid and [[Cookbook:rye|rye]] flour.  By manipulating rising times, kneading techniques, and with the use of specialty brick ovens, the French breads are as varied and unique as the regions in France.

===Basic Ingredients===
====Flour====
:The most common flour used in baking is wheat-based, which contains proteins that, when agitated in the presence of water, form gluten. Gluten is a stretchy protein structure that holds in the bubbles made by leaveners (such as yeast or baking powder). Flours are graded by the amount of protein — in the United States, the standard bread flour contains 11-13% protein. All-purpose flour has a protein content of 8-10%, and pastry flour, used primarily for baking, is a softer flour with a protein content less than 8%.  In Europe, the flour generally contains a lower protein content than that found in American bread flour, which necessitates longer mixing times and additions to the flour, such as ascorbic acid (a form of vitamin C, which gives the dough tenacity for better rising).

====Water====
:Many bakers prefer to use filtered water. Tap water that contains any traces of chlorine should not be used because the chlorine can kill the yeast.

====Yeast====
:Two basic kinds of yeast are used in bread making: commercial yeast and natural yeast, which is the kind of yeast contained in sourdoughs.  The two most common types of commercial yeast are compressed, also called cake yeast, and active dry yeast. Active dry yeast must first be “proofed” to activate it prior to adding it to the flour and water.  Yeast is soaked in a small amount of water between 90-110F or 32-43C for approximately ten minutes. Sugar can be added to help the yeast “feed” and proof faster.
:Natural yeast is trickier to work with, and it must be kept in controlled environments. By combining flour and water and allowing it to sit, the mixture will pick up natural yeasts in the air that will ferment to create more yeast. With repeated stirring and additions of flour and water, the mixture will become a sourdough. The sourness of the dough comes from a bacterial culture that lives alongside the natural yeast, typically a lactobacilli strain, most famously &quot;Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis&quot;, as in the famous San Francisco sourdough.

====Salt====
:Salt serves a more important function than just providing flavor; it also controls the fermentation of the yeast. Too much salt and the yeast action will be retarded; too little salt, and the dough will not entrap enough carbonic gases to form a strong texture.  Certain breads, such as Italian ciabattas, do not traditionally contain salt, but the majority of breads do.

==Recipes==
:Below are a few delicious bread recipes to get you started in the bread-making process. Enjoy!

===Cheddar-Broccoli Bread Roll===
Makes 12 servings.&lt;br/&gt;

===Herb Biscuits===
Makes 8 Servings&lt;br/&gt;
'''Ingredients'''&lt;br/&gt;
*¾ cup all purpose flour
*¾ cup whole wheat flour
*1 tablespoon baking powder
*¼ teaspoon salt
*½ teaspoon dried marjoram
*½ teaspoon dill weed
*¼ teaspoon dried thyme
*1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
*3 tablespoons margarine
*½ cup plus 2 tablespoons skim milk&lt;br/&gt;
'''Directions'''&lt;br/&gt;
#Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Have an ungreased baking sheet ready.  
#In a large bowl, combine both flours, baking powder, salt, and spices. Mix well.  
#Add margarine, mix with a fork or pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
#Add milk.  Stir until dry ingredients are moistened.
#Place dough on a floured surface and knead a few times until dough holds together in a ball. Add a small amount of flour if dough is sticky.  
#Roll dough, or press with your hands, to ½ inch thickness.  Using a 3-inch biscuit cutter or a glass, cut 8 biscuits. (Scraps can be put together and rolled again.)
#Place biscuits on baking sheet.  Bake 10 minutes, or until lightly browned.
#Remove to a wire rack.  Serve hot.

===Sourdough Starter===
Preparation time: 10 minutes&lt;br/&gt;
Stand time: 5 to 10 days&lt;br/&gt;
'''Ingredients'''&lt;br/&gt;
*1 package active dry yeast
*2 ½ cups warm water (105 to 115 degrees Farenheit)
*2 cups all purpose flour
*1 tablespoon sugar or honey&lt;br/&gt;
'''Directions'''&lt;br/&gt;
#Dissolve yeast in ½ cup of the warm water. 
#Stir in the remaining warm water, flour and sugar or honey. Beat till smooth. 
#Cover with 100% cotton cheesecloth. Let stand at room temperature (75 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit) for 5 to 10 days or until mixture has a fermented aroma and vigorous bubbling stops, stirring 2 or 3 times a day. (Fermentation time depends on room temperature; a warmer room will hasten the fermentation process.)
#To store, transfer sourdough starter to a 1-quart covered plastic container and refrigerate. 
#To use, stir starter. Measure desired amount of cold starter. Bring to room temperature. 
#Replenish starter after each use by stirring ¾ cup all-purpose flour, ¾ cup water, and 1 teaspoon sugar or honey into remaining starter. 
#Cover with cheesecloth; let stand at room temperature 1 day or till bubbly. 
#Cover with lid; chill for later use. 
#If starter isn't used within 10 days, stir in 1 teaspoon sugar or honey.  Continue to add an additional 1 teaspoon sugar or honey every 10 days unless the starter is replenished.

===Sourdough Bread===

#Combine 2 ½ cups of the remaining flour and the baking soda. Add to yeast mixture. Stir until combined. 
#Stir in as much remaining flour as you can.
#Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface. Knead in enough remaining flour to make a moderately stiff dough (6 to 8 minutes total). 
#Shape dough into a ball. Place dough in a greased bowl till double in size (45 to 60 minutes).
#Punch dough down. Turn onto a floured surface.  Divide in half. Cover; let rest 10 minutes. 
#Lightly grease a baking sheet.
#Shape by gently pulling each portion into a ball, tucking edges beneath. Place on prepared baking sheet. Flatten each slightly to 6 inches in diameter. 
#Using a sharp knife, make crisscross slashes across tops of loaves. Cover and let rise in a warm place till nearly double in size (about 30 minutes).
#Bake in a 375 degree Fahrenheit oven 30 to 35 minutes or till bread sounds hollow when you tap the top (if necessary, cover loosely with foil the last 10 minutes of baking to prevent overbrowning). 
#Immediately remove bread from baking sheet. Cool on wire racks. Makes 2 loaves (24 to 36 servings).

'''Cheyeeam''' - deep-fried balls of ground chickpeas.

==Ingredients==
* ½ kg [[Cookbook:Chickpea|kadalai paruppu]] (Bengal gram, small brown chickpeas)
* ½ kg [[Cookbook:Jaggery|vellam]] (jaggery, unrefined palm sugar)
* 10 [[Cookbook:Cardamom|elackai]] (elachi, cardamom pods)
* ½ kg [[Cookbook:Maida|maida mavu]] (refined wheat flour)
* 1 litre [[Cookbook:cooking oil|cooking oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], to taste
* [[Cookbook:Water|water]] for the maida dough

==Method==
# Soak kadalai paruppu in clean water for at least 8 hours. They will double in size, so allow extra water for them to soak up!
# For pooranam, boil kadalai paruppu. This should take about 40 minutes in a pot, or about 9 minutes in a [[Cookbook:Pressure Cooking|pressure cooker]] (plus 10 minutes to depressurise).
# Grind boiled kadalai paruppu with the jaggery and elachi, without adding any water, making a dough. Make small balls with the dough.
# Make fine dough of maida with a little water, forming a dense consistency. Add salt as needed.
# Soak pooranam balls in the maida dough.
# Pour the oil in a pan. After heating oil, add a few pooranam balls. [[Cookbook:Deep Fat Frying|Deep fry]] individually until golden.

This isn't exactly a meatloaf imitation, but it is a hearty version of a vegetarian classic. It's not too far from a version that was sold commercially in the past, but has been discontinued. Now you have to make your own, and this one is more flavorful and has better ingredients than the discontinued one.

==Ingredients==
*&amp;frac12; [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Rice|brown rice]] (not all will be used)
*&amp;frac12; cup [[Cookbook:Lentil|lentils]]
*2&amp;frac12; cups [[Cookbook:Stock|vegetable stock]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaf]]
*1 beaten [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] (approx.) seasoned [[Cookbook:Bread Crumb|bread crumbs]]
*&amp;frac12; finely chopped [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]

==Procedure==
Cook the lentils (in about 1&amp;frac12; cups of stock, with the bay leaf). Cover and simmer for approximately 45 minutes, or until lentils are tender but not falling apart (they should offer slight resistance to the bite). You may need to add additional stock during cooking; the lentils should remain covered. At the same time, cook the brown rice in 1 cup of stock--bring the stock to a boil, add rice, reduce heat to low, cover and cook at lowest setting for 50 minutes.

Empty about three-quarters of the rice into a bowl, along with lentils. A little liquid from the lentils should be added--maybe two to three tablespoons' worth, but not too much. To the lentil-rice mixture add the egg, onion, olive oil and bread crumbs. Adjust ratio of rice to lentils by adding more rice if desired. Add bread crumbs until mixture holds together.

Place mixture in a small greased baking dish and bake at 350&amp;deg; F for 35 minutes, or until a crust is formed around the edge. Allow to cool for at least ten minutes before cutting and serving. Serves 4.

Basic roast [[Cookbook:Duck|duck]].

== Ingredients ==
* 1 young duckling (3-6 lbs, 1 1/2 - 3 kg)
* salt and pepper
* Butter flavored nonstick spray

== Procedure ==
# Preheat oven to [[Cookbook:Oven temperatures|450F]].  
# Rinse and wipe duckling, removing giblets.  
# Set bird aside in an airy place to allow the skin to dry.  
# Rub inside cavity with salt and pepper.  
# Insert vertical oven roaster (used for &quot;beer can chicken&quot;) into bird and prop it upright.  
# Coat bird on all sides with butter-flavored spray and sprinkle salt and pepper lightly over the skin. 
# Place bird and vertical roaster into a large roasting pan (use a wire rack insert if you have one) and add 1/2 cup of water to the bottom of the pan.  
# Leave bird in oven for 30 minutes, then reduce heat to [[Cookbook:Oven temperatures|325F]] until done. No need to prick skin or baste bird, as the fat slowly renders off leaving a wonderful crispy skin.  Keep the bottom of the roasting pan covered with water to prevent smoking.
# Pour off fat and save, reserving drippings and liquid from the roasting pan.  (The fat and liver can be cooked together to make a very tasty paté so don't throw any of it out!)

The use of soy protein in this recipe increases the [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]'s natural flavor. This bread is very easy to prepare.

==Ingredients==

* 2 Tablets of fresh yeast (30g)
* 2 Eggs
* 1 cup of oil
* 3 cups of warm milk
* 1 table spoon of sugar
* 1 table spoon of salt
* 1 cup of TSP (texturized soy protein)
* 8 cups of flour

==Procedure==

# Heat the milk until it is about to boil, then add the salt and the soy protein. Mix it for the salt to be well dissolved. Let it rest until is warm again.
# Put on the blender the milk and the rest of the ingredients, including the yeast. Mix it for a few seconds until it is homogeneous.
# Pour the mixture on a bowl and start adding the flour while mixing to keep the bread homogeneous all the time.
# Work the bread with your hands all the time, always keeping it smooth. You may have to add some extra flour while you work with it. Keep doing this until the bread stops being sticky.
# Let it rest for about 25 minutes at a warm place, with approximate constant temperature.
# Separate several small balls of bread of about 1 inches (2.5 cm) in diameter and half of it in height.
# Put the breads on a oven tray with some distance between them and leave them for other 15 minutes.
# Pre heat the oven at about 200°C and put the tray in a medium position inside the oven.
# Let them cook for about 20 minutes.

==Variations==

* You may increase the amount of oil by half a cup to make it more moist and increase its lifetime.
* You may add minced provolone into the mixture (not filling) to give it a delicious subtle taste of cheese. 
* You may of course fill it as well.
* You may cook it in diferent shapes that the small bread

{{recipe}}  |  [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Poland|Poland]]

== Ingredients ==
Filling:
* 1 large can (~28 oz.) sauerkraut
* 1 medium onion, diced
* 1 stick butter  
* Salt and pepper
Dough:
* 2 cups all purpose flour
* 1 egg (optional)
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* water

== Preparation ==

Place sauerkraut and liquid in a pot filled with just enough water to cover the sauerkraut. When it begins to boil, remove from stove and place in a collander then drain and rinse well with cold water to prevent further cooking. With your hands, squeeze as much liquid from the kraut as you can to prevent the pierogies from being too soggy. Place the sauerkraut on a large cutting board and chop fine with a large flat-bladed knife.

Fry the onion until it is translucent and then add the drained sauerkraut. Salt and pepper to taste.  Simmer for 15 minutes and let it cool before using.  For best results, refrigerate a few hours before filling in [[Pierogies]].

For the dough, sift and measure flour with salt into a large bowl. Slightly beat egg with fork and add egg to flour, then add enough water to make a pastry dough soft enough to roll out with a rolling pin but not too dry that it spits and cracks. Roll out dough on a floured bread board until about the thickness of a cracker. Use a large rimmed glass or a big biscuit cutter to cut rounds approximately 3&quot;-4&quot; in diameter. Fill each round with a generous spoonful of kraut mixture and fold dough in half. Pinch and seal the edge of the dough with fingers then gently fold and pinch edge to make a ruffled edge with about 1/4&quot; folds. Drop each pierogie dumpling into a large pot of boiling salt water and boil until they float to the top. Remove each carefully with a slotted spoon. Fry the pierogie in a skillet with melted butter until golden brown. Serve warm or cold.

== Notes ==

The boiling stem may be omitted if you like really strong sauerkraut.

Traditionally, a '''beurre blanc''' consists of nearly equal parts white wine and good white wine vinegar reduced dramatically with shallot, held in emulsion with quite a lot of butter.  Once the basic technique has been mastered, don't be afraid to experiment with new ingredients. Many modern variations exist employing any number of herbs and flavorings.  

The sauce, whose name means &quot;white butter,&quot; traces its roots to the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|French cuisine]] of the Loire Valley, and would be conventionally served with river fish, like [[Cookbook:Trout|trout]] or [[Cookbook:Pike|pike]].  

Correctly prepared, a basic beurre blanc should be creamy and tangy with a good savory component, pairing well with lean meats, particularly fish.  I recommend it highly with a nice preparation of pan-seared [[Cookbook:Halibut|halibut]], seasoned simply with salt and pepper.  What follows is a recipe for a simple, semi-traditional beurre blanc.

==Ingredients==
* a [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] of good white [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]] (dry aromatic white, preferably French, such as Pouilly-Fumé)
* [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|juice]] of one [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]
* one or two [[Cookbook:Shallot|shallots]]
* 10-12 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|Tbs]] unsalted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], in cubes or lumps
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|white pepper]] 
* optional (and non-traditional): 1 Tbs heavy [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]]

==Procedure==

# For four portions, start with a cup of good white wine with a strong acidity (think dry aromatic white, preferably French, such as Pouilly-Fumé) in a non-reactive saucepan with the juice of one lemon and one or two very finely chopped shallots.
# Reduce the mixture to about two tablespoons, and don't be shy about letting it boil: it will not adversely effect the sauce.  Once reduced, the shallot should still be fairly moist. If you're looking at a dry pan, there's a good chance your sauce won't hold.
# Reduce heat to low flame.  If you want to increase the holding power of your sauce, you can add a tablespoon or so of heavy cream at this juncture, but every authority on traditional French preparation would disapprove.
# Begin to add smallish cubes of very good, very cold unsalted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] while whisking vigorously.  From a technical standpoint, the sauce should stay under 200°F (95°C), so do some of the whisking off the flame.  Whisk in one or two cubes and add more, and continue until you've added about 10 to 12 tablespoons of butter.  
# Season with salt and white pepper and serve immediately.  The sauce can be held in a vacuum container, such a Thermos, but I don't recommend it for long periods of time.

American chefs may try to enhance the presentation of the sauce by straining the shallot out before plating, but the French know better.  If the shallot has been sufficiently chopped it has no deleterious effect on the texture of the finished product.

'''Chocolate Chip Rolls''' - This is a recipe grown out of an experiment on my usual biscuit recipe; they're not extremely sweet, but fall closer to dessert than just rolls or biscuits.

== Ingredients ==

I tend to cook with half whole wheat flour and half white flour; the recipe should work fine with all white flour as well (probably a little less milk).

* 2c (280g) [[Cookbook:Whole-wheat flour|Whole-wheat flour]]
* 2c (280g) [[Cookbook:White unbleached flour|White unbleached flour]]
* 1t [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]]
* 3t [[Cookbook:Baking powder|Baking powder]]
* 1 1/2c (360ml) [[Cookbook:Milk|Milk]] ([[Cookbook:soy milk|soy milk]] works fine, too, with no appreciable change in taste)
* 1/2c (120ml) [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|Vegetable oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Chocolate chips|Chocolate chips]] (or small chocolate pieces)

== Procedure ==

[[Image:Chocolate-Chip-Roll-Dough-With-Chips-2006Feb24.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A roll in progress.]]

* Preheat over to 425°F (210°C)
* Mix dry ingredients
* Add liquid ingredients to dry, mix
* Turn dough out onto floured baking cloth and knead slightly
* Roll dough into log, cut into 8-12 pieces
* Press pieces flat, sprinkle with chocolate chips, and roll
* Place rolls on greased baking sheet, cook 13-15min
* Enjoy! Best fresh.

==Ingredients==
* [[w:Semolina|Semolina]]
* [[w:Oatmeal|Oat flakes]]
* [[w:Onions|Onions]]
* optional:
** Hacked [[w:paprika|paprika]]
** [[w:Maize|Maize]]
** [[w:Button_mushroom|Champignons]]
** [[w:Leek_%28vegetable%29|Leek]]
** [[w:Soy_sauce|Soy sauce]]
** [[w:Cornstarch|Cornstarch]]
** Breading: [[w:breading|breading mix]], salt, pepper, optional: [[w:cumin|cumin]], [[w:oregano|oregano]], [[w:Savory (herb)|savory]]

==Procedure==
* Mix semolina with oat flakes at a ratio of 4 : 1.
* Add water and stir until you get a viscous substance. You can add spices to the substance but most spices go into the breading mix, which is where you want them to be.
* Cut onions into pieces and fry them with some oil, add maize and paprika to taste when the onions turn glassy.
* Mix the breading mix with salt, pepper and spices of your choice on a plate. Keep some of the breading mix to sprinkle it on the patties.
* Spread the substance on the breading mix in the form of burger patties.
* Sprinkle the remaining breading mix on the patties.
* Push the patties carefully on a spatula and fry them in a hot, oiled pan. If you use too much oil the patties will be soaked in fat, if you use too little the breading mix will not be fried. It's probably best to add a little bit of oil and then shuffle the patties around in the pan. The patties very quickly become robust enough so you can easily pick them up and turn them with a spatula to see if the other side had enough oil.
* You may want to
** shake off loose breading mix over the plate, so as not to put loose breading mix into the pan. 
** topple the patties into the pan.
** flatten the patties a bit with the spatula, so the breading mix on the underside touches the oiled pan everywhere.

== Variants ==
* Adding 5 to 10% of [[w:cornstarch|cornstarch]] makes the patties looser.
* You can mix semolina and oat flakes 1:1, which makes the patties more compact.
* Adding [[w:Gluten|gluten]] (or [[w:Wheat_gluten_%28food%29|seitan]] mix) makes the patties tougher, without making them more compact.
* Without breading the patties require less oil.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Meat_Recipes|Meat recipes]]

'''Kombdi Vade''' is a Malvani dish, which is quite popular in [[Maharashtra]]. The dish consists of the traditional Malvani [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] curry (including chicken pieces with bones), vade (also known as puri, which is a fluffy, fried bread of wheat and nachni flour), onion, lemon and solkadhi (a drink made from coconut milk).

==Ingredients==
*800 [[Cookbook:g|g]] (1.8 [[Cookbook:Pound|lb]]) or 8 medium sized pieces of [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Coconut|coconut]] grated
*4 [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]] chopped
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:chilli|Chilli Powder]]
*1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsps]] [[Cookbook:Garam Masala|garam masala]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsps]] Malvani Special Masala
*8 [[Cookbook:Green chilly|green chillies]] chopped
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbs]] [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]] paste
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbs]] [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] paste
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbs]] oil
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste
*finely chopped coriander leaves for garnishing

==Procedure==
#Grind half of the green chillies to a paste and mix it well with the ginger and garlic pastes. 
#Make cuts on the chicken pieces, rub this mixture on to them well and marinate for about an hour at least.
#Roast coconut shavings in a little hot oil till light brown. Cool and grind along with half the onions to a paste.
#Heat oil in a heavy-bottomed pan and saute the onions on medium level for about 2  minute(s) or till they are light brown in color.
#Add the remaining chopped green chillies, spice powders and fry for a few seconds. Add the marinated chicken pieces and fry on medium level for about 3  minutes or till they are lightly browned.
#Add the paste, salt and mix well. Add water according to the desired level of consistency and bring to a boil. Cover and cook on low level for about 25  minute(s) or till the chicken pieces are tender and fully cooked.
#Garnish with finely chopped coriander leaves. 

==Notes, tips and variations==

If it is difficult to obtain fresh coconut, it can be replaced by desscicated coconut shavings. For this recipe, there is no need to soak it in warm water. Roast it directly.

This is an easier version of [[Cookbook:Peanut Brittle|Peanut Brittle]] that can be prepared in under 10 minutes using a microwave.

==Ingredients==
*1 cup sugar
*1/2 cup white corn syrup
*1 cup roasted peanuts
*1 teaspoon butter
*1 teaspoon vanilla
*1 teaspoon baking soda

==Directions==
*Lightly grease cookie sheet and set aside.
*In 1 1/2 qt. casserole dish stir together sugar and syrup. Microwave at high for 4 minutes.
*Stir in peanuts. Microwave at high for 3-5 minutes or until light brown.
*Add butter and vanilla, blending well. Microwave at high 1-2 minutes more. Peanuts will be lightly browned and syrup very hot.
*Add baking soda and stir gently until light and foamy.
*Pour mixture onto greased cookie sheet. Let cool 1/2 hour to 1 hour. When cool, break into small pieces and store in airtight container.
*Makes about 1 pound.

==Tips==
*Take care not to overcook or undercook. Overcooking results in a burnt taste, and undercooking results in a taffy-like consistency that sticks to the teeth.
*Microwave times will depend on the power of your individual microwave. It may take a few experiments before you determine what is the right cooking time.
*If you start seeing part of the mixture turning brown, it is probably beginning to burn. Remove immediately.

'''Steamed Pork With Mustard Greens''' (梅菜扣肉, [[w:Pinyin|pinyin]]: Méicàikòuròu) or '''Mei Cai Kou Rou''' is a [[w:Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] dish from the [[w:Hakka cuisine|Hakka]] people. It is very popular and tasty but contains a lot of saturated fat.

==Ingredients==
* About 10.5 ounces [[Cookbook:Mustard Greens|mustard greens]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:cornstarch|cornstarch]] combined with 1 teaspoon cold water
* 1/2 teaspoon [[Cookbook:sugar|sugar]]
* 2 teaspoons light [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Rice Wine|rice wine]] or water
* 3/4 pound [[Cookbook:pork|pork]] tenderloin
* 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]]
* 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Black Bean and Garlic Sauce|black bean and garlic sauce]]
* About 2 tablespoons water
* Freshly ground [[Cookbook:black pepper|black pepper]]

==Directions==
# Wash greens and discard tough stems. Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add greens and time 2 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking. Drain again, then cut greens into long diagonal strips.
# In a medium bowl, combine cornstarch and water. Stir in sugar, soy sauce and rice wine. Cut pork into thin slices and add to the mixture. Marinate about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
# Heat oil in a preheated wok or large heavy skillet over medium heat. Add black bean sauce and stir-fry 1 minute, then add pork and stir-fry 2 minutes. Add mustard greens and water. Mix well and simmer gently about 4 to 5 minutes, until pork is cooked through and greens are tender. Season with pepper and serve.

This is a delicious, refreshing, and simple Brazilian dessert. It does have some alcohol (Creme de Cassis -- blackcurrant liqueur), but a non-alcoholic blackcurrant syrup could be substituted.

==Ingredients ==
* 1 ripe [[Cookbook:papaya|papaya]]
* 1 scoop [[Cookbook:vanilla ice cream|vanilla ice cream]]
* 1 tbsp. [[Cookbook:blackcurrant liqueur|blackcurrant liqueur]]
* 1 sprig of [[Cookbook:mint|mint]] for decoration (optional)

== Procedure ==
;Method 1: 
#Peel papaya and remove seeds. [[Cookbook:Cube|Cube]] the papaya. 
#Put papaya pieces in [[Cookbook:blender|blender]] with ice cream and blackcurrant liqueur. [[Cookbook:Blend|Blend]] well until smooth. 
#Pour into a small bowl and decorate with mint. 

;Method 2: 
#Peel papaya and remove seeds. Cube the papaya. 
#Put papaya pieces in blender with ice cream and blend until creamy consistency. 
#Pour some blackcurrant liqueur on the bottom of a large dessert glass. 
#Add the cream mixture. Add a swirl of blackcurrant liqueur on the top. 

;Method 3: 
#Cut papaya in half and remove seeds. Scoop papaya from peel with a spoon (this is easier and cleaner than peeling the fruit). 
#Place approximately equal portions of papaya and vanilla ice cream in a blender. Blend until creamy. 
#Place the mixture into a serving dish and pour about an ounce of [[Cookbook:Creme de Cassis|Creme de Cassis]] on top.

Either way, it is best served immediately, but can be chilled for a short time.

Serves one.

'''Hot water crust''' is a type of [[Cookbook:Pastry|pastry]] used for savory [[Cookbook:Pie|pie]]s, such as [[Cookbook:Pork Pie|pork pie]]s and [[Cookbook:Steak and Kidney Pie|steak and kidney pie]]s. As it contains [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]], it is unsuitable for [[Cookbook:Vegetarian cuisine|vegetarians]]. Vegetable fat or [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]] can be substituted in equal measure, but the texture will be slightly different (and mouthfeel will be somewhat lighter) due to the &quot;grain&quot; of lard. 

== Ingredients ==

* 170g (6 oz) [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 170ml (6 fl oz) [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* 85g (3 oz) [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]]
* [[Cookbook:Pinch|pinch]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

== Procedure ==
# Sift the flour and salt into a bowl. Make a well in the center.
# Place the water and lard into a [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]] over low heat. When the lard has melted, bring to a boil.
# Pour the mixture into the center of the flour.
# Working very quickly, mix with a wooden spoon.
# Knead with hands to produce a smooth dough.
# This pastry must be used while still warm; otherwise it will become brittle and hard to mould.

== Notes, tips, and variations ==
* Sometimes an [[Cookbook:Egg|egg yolk]] is added to the flour and salt mixture.

'''Butter tea''', known as ''Po Cha'', is a traditional drink of the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Tibet|Tibetans]] and is also consumed in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Bhutan|Bhutan]]. Butter tea is an indispensable part of Tibetan life. Before work, a Tibetan will down several bowlfuls of this tangy beverage, and it is always served to guests. Since butter is the main ingredient, butter tea is a very warming drink and a good antidote to the cold, so it is especially suited to high altitudes. 

According to the Tibetan custom, butter tea is drunk in separate sips, and after each sip the host refills the bowl to the brim. Thus the guest never drains his bowl yet it is constantly topped up. If the visitor does not wish to drink, the best thing to do is leave the tea untouched until the time comes to leave and then drain the bowl. In this way etiquette is observed and the host will not be offended. 

== Ingredients ==
* 1 tablespoon regular [[Cookbook:Tea|black tea]] (preferably [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Nepal|Nepalese]] or [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]])
* 3 cups whole [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] (or 1½ cup &quot;half-and-half&quot; / &quot;lite&quot; milk + 1½ cup water)
* 2 tablespoons unsalted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste 

== Procedure == 
# Boil tea with milk for 2-10 min, depending upon the strength of tea desired
# Strain into tea cups. 
# Add butter and salt. Stir thoroughly - ideally by carefully using a blender - and serve. Makes two servings.

'''Boilo''' is a traditional Yuletide drink of the north-eastern United States, specifically  Pennsylvania.

Boilo is a type of whiskey-based liqueur made with oranges, lemons, sugar and various different spices such as cinnamon.  Recipes vary and may include nutmeg, cloves, caraway seed and aniseed.

== Ingredients == 
* 2 medium-large [[Cookbook:orange|orange]]s 
* 2 [[Cookbook:lemon|lemon]]s
* 1 small box [[Cookbook:raisin|raisin]]s (about 1½ ounces [40g])
* 8 oz (220g) [[Cookbook:honey|honey]]
* 12 oz (355 mL) [[Cookbook:whiskey|whiskey]] (or more, to taste).&lt;ref&gt; Use Four Roses, or Seagrams 7, or something similar. At least 80 proof (40% alcohol).&lt;/ref&gt;
* ½ to 1 teaspoon each of any or all of these spices: [[Cookbook:cinnamon|cinnamon]], [[Cookbook:nutmeg|nutmeg]], [[Cookbook:cloves|cloves]], [[Cookbook:Caraway|caraway seed]], [[Cookbook:Anise|aniseed]]

==Procedure==
#Make this in a [[Cookbook:Crock Pot|crock pot]]. It's easier than cooking on the stove and much less likely to overcook or scorch. For the quantities shown here, a small (1.5 quart) crock pot will do.
#Peel the oranges and lemons. Cut up the fruit and squeeze them into the crock pot. A [[Cookbook:Garlic Press|garlic press]] works, or some kind of juicer or fruit squeezer. Put the remaining fruit pulp into the crock pot as well.
#Add the raisins, honey, and spices. Stir.
#*NOTE: do not add whiskey yet!
#Start the crock pot and let the mixture cook for about 2-4 hours. Stir occasionally. It's complete when the fruit pulp gets cooked down.
#Strain into a pitcher. Mash down the fruit in the strainer to get all the liquid. Now add the whiskey to the pitcher and stir. If you cook the whiskey, even for a short time, the alcohol will start to evaporate . Taste, and add more whiskey to your liking.
#Serve hot in shot glasses, espresso cups, or coffee mugs. After the first round, each individual serving can be heated in the microwave.
#This recipe makes about 12 ounces (355 mL) of &quot;virgin&quot; boilo. Add 12 ounces of whiskey to this and you get 24 ounces (710 mL) of coal region nectar, enough for 12-18 servings.

'''Seitan burgers''' (''[[wikipedia:Schnitzel|vegetarian Schnitzel]]'') have a consistency similar to that of [[w:fillet|fillet]] and are easy to cover with breading.
For the breading the usual spices for meat can be used.

==Ingredients==
* [[Cookbook:Gluten|Gluten]] (see [[Cookbook:Seitan|Seitan]] for how to gain gluten from wheat flour)
* [[Cookbook:Soy_sauce|Soy sauce]]
* Salt
* optional:
** Spices (e.g. [[Cookbook:Garlic|Garlic]])
** [[Cookbook:Onion|Onions]]
** Breading: [[Cookbook:breading|breading mix]], salt, pepper, optional: [[Cookbook:cumin|cumin]], [[Cookbook:oregano|oregano]], [[Cookbook:Savory|savory]]

==Procedure==
* Take 25% (volume) more water than gluten flour.
* Mix liquid ingredients (e.g. soy sauce) with the water.
* Mix solid ingredients (e.g. spices) with the flour. It is much easier to mix solid and liquid ingredients separately than adding ingredients to the gluten dough later, as it is very rubbery and sticky.
* Make gluten dough from 100% gluten flour (or use wheat flour, see above) and water. The dough should be suitable for kneading.
* The patties can be formed easily by hand and are sticky enough to pick up the breading mix easily.
* The finished patties can be fried in an oiled pan. Don't use too much oil but enough to let the breading pick up some oil on both sides.

'''Beef Stroganoff''', in its simplest form, is simply tender beef with a mushroom and sour cream sauce served over rice or [[Cookbook:Noodle|noodles]].

The current accepted history of this dish dates back to the 1890s when a chef* working for Count Pavel Alexandrovich Stroganov (the famous Russian general) invented the recipe for a cooking competition in St. Petersburg. After the fall of Imperial [[Cookbook:cuisine of Russia|Russia]], the recipe was popularly served in the hotels and restaurants of [[Cookbook:cuisine of China|China]] before the start of the Second World War. Russian and Chinese immigrants, as well as U.S. servicemen stationed in China, brought several variants of the dish to the [[Cookbook:cuisine of the United States|United States]], which may account for its popularity during the 1950s.  It is commonly served with noodles or rice.

It is also very popular in [[Cookbook:cuisine of Brazil|Brazil]] (where it is better known as &quot;strogonoff&quot; or &quot;estrogonofe&quot;), but the recipe is slightly different there.

Note * Despite the allusion of the name &quot;stroganoff&quot; to Count Paul Stroganoff, a 19th century Russian diplomat, the origins of the dish have never been confirmed. Larousse Gastronomique notes that similar dishes were known since the 18th century but insists the dish by this specific name was the creation of chef '''Charles Briere''' who was working in St. Petersburg when he submitted the recipe to '''L 'Art Culinaire''' in 1891, but the dish seems much older. It did not appear in English cookbooks until 1932, and it was not until the 1940s that beef stroganoff became popular for elegant dinner parties in America.

== Traditional ==

=== Ingredients ===
* 450g (1 pound) [[Cookbook:beef|beef]] [[Cookbook:chuck roast|chuck roast]]
* 1/2 teaspoon [[Cookbook:salt|salt]] 
* 1/2 teaspoon ground [[Cookbook:black pepper|black pepper]] 
* 110g (4 ounces) [[Cookbook:butter|butter]] 
* 4 [[Cookbook:green onion|green onion]]s, sliced (white parts only) 
* 4 tablespoons [[Cookbook:all-purpose flour|all-purpose flour]] 
* 1 300g (10.5 ounce) can condensed [[Cookbook:broth|beef broth]] 
* 1 teaspoon prepared [[Cookbook:mustard|mustard]] 
* 1 150g (6 ounce) can sliced [[Cookbook:mushroom|mushrooms]], drained 
* 160ml (1/3 cup) [[Cookbook:sour cream|sour cream]] 
* 160ml (1/3 cup) [[Cookbook:white wine|white wine]] 
* [[Cookbook:salt|salt]] to taste 
* ground [[Cookbook:black pepper|black pepper]] to taste 

=== Procedure ===
#Remove any fat and gristle from the roast and cut into strips 1/2 inch thick by 2 inches long. Season with 1/2 teaspoon of both salt and pepper. 
#In a large [[Cookbook:skillet|skillet]] over medium heat, melt the butter and [[Cookbook:browning|brown]] the beef strips quickly, then push the beef strips off to one side. Add the onions and cook slowly for 3 to 5 minutes, then push to the side with the beef strips. 
#Stir the flour into the juices on the empty side of the pan. Pour in beef broth and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Lower the heat and stir in mustard. 
#Cover and simmer for 1 hour or until the meat is tender. 
#Five minutes before serving, stir in the mushrooms, sour cream, and white wine. Heat briefly then salt and pepper to taste. 

Also very popular as a basic food service dish as it is very easy to produce it in large quantities.

== Quick and Easy ==

=== Ingredients ===
* 2 pkg (around 1.5 - 2.0 pounds) Bit Size [[Cookbook:beef|beef]] (I prefer pre-cut stew meat. Left-over steaks cut into pieces works well. Ground beef browned in a skillet can also work if you have it around.)
* 1 can (8oz) [[Cookbook:cream of mushroom soup|cream of mushroom soup]]
* 1/2 can (4oz) [[Cookbook:broth|beef broth]]
* 1 Tub (8oz) [[Cookbook:sour cream|sour cream]]
* 1 bag (16oz) [[Cookbook:egg noodles|egg noodles]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] and [[Cookbook:pepper|pepper]] to taste

=== Procedure ===
# Cook egg noodles in a large pot according to directions.
# While egg noodles cook, season the beef with salt and pepper and [[Cookbook:brown|brown]] the meat in a [[Cookbook:skillet|skillet]] unless it is already cooked. Low and slow makes a tender product. If meat is already cooked, heat the meat in the [[Cookbook:microwave oven|microwave]] or in a skillet.
# Drain egg noodles.
# Mix cream of mushroom soup, beef broth, and sour cream in the pot used for the egg noodles. Season the sauce with salt and pepper keeping in mind that many of the ingredients contain plenty of salt.
# Add noodle mixture with beef and serve.

This meal makes great left-overs.

'''Cinnamon croutons''' are a sweet variation on the classic salad crouton, which can be used to enhance a fruit salad.  Alternately, these croutons make a good addition to pumpkin, sweet potato or carrot soups.

==Ingredients==
*4 slices day-old [[Cookbook:French bread|French bread]], cubed
*4 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Walnut|walnut]] [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]
*4 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|ground cinnamon]]

Makes enough croutons for 4 to 6 servings of fruit salad.

==Procedure==
# Combine sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl, and set aside.
# Preheat the oven to 350°F (~180°C).
# Pour the walnut oil into a pan and fry the bread cubes in it, tossing to coat with oil.
# Spread the bread cubes on a baking sheet and garnish with cinnamon sugar.  Bake for 8 minutes or until crispy and dry.  Allow to cool well before handling, as the sugar will make these croutons easier to brown, and thus hotter to handle initially.

{{recipe}}

Lemon curd is a custard-like dessert sauce made with eggs, lemon juice and zest, sugar, and butter.  It goes well with scones, short breads, and muffins. 

This recipe will produce one full 12-ounce (330g) jar of lemon curd (similar to but not the same as lemon pie filling), plus a little left over so you can lick the bowl.  Lemon curd keeps for up to a week in the refrigerator.  It is excellent on short bread, biscuits, scones, and English muffins. 

You can prepare this recipe in about 20 minutes.

==Equipment==

* 1-quart saucepan
* whisk
* measuring cup
* grater or zester
* medium to large strainer of fine-to-medium mesh
* rubber spatula
* 1-quart kitchen bowl
* stove
* 12-ounce (about 330g) jar with sealable lid

==Ingredients==

* 1/2 cup (120ml) freshly squeezed [[Cookbook:lemon|lemon]] juice
* 2 tablespoons freshly grated lemon [[Cookbook:zest|zest]]
** (Note: you get these from 1/2 [[Cookbook:Meyer lemon|Meyer lemon]], or 1 robust Morgan lemon, or 3 normal lemons)
* 1/3 cup (80g) sugar
* 3 eggs
* 3/4 stick (6 tablespoons or 3 ounces or 90g) of unsalted [[Cookbook:butter|butter]]
* pinch (1/16 teaspoon) of salt (optional, to bring out the sweetness and flavor of finished product)

==Directions==

# Grate the lemon rinds to produce two tablespoons of zest.
# Extract the juice from the lemons to produce 1/2 cup of juice.
# Cut the butter into small chunks.
# Put eggs, zest, sugar, and salt into cooled [[Cookbook:saucepan|saucepan]].
# Whisk ingredients in pan till frothy and light in color (a minute or two).
# Add lemon juice and whisk 30 seconds.
# Add butter chunks.
# Set pan on stove burner, turn on heat to medium-to-low, and start whisking contents so they don't coagulate or stick to bottom of pan.
# Whisk constantly till butter melts and mixture thickens, then whisk another two minutes, but do not let mixture boil - it should be quite steamy (185 degrees).
# Set strainer over bowl and pour mixture into strainer, removing all of the mixture with spatula.  Note: Some people like the zest left in.
# Work the mixture through the strainer with the spatula to strain out the zest and any egg lumps; rake mixture off bottom of strainer into bowl.
# Pour mixture from bowl into jar to within 1/4 inch from top, taking care not to get mixture on rim, then seal jar with lid.
# Refrigerate to thicken the product further.

This is the basic recipe and method for Jewish Rosehip Soup. It is also popular in Iceland and parts of Scandinavia, where, because of the cold temperatures, it's often used for colds and sore throats. 

==Ingredients==  
* 1 [[Cookbook:L|litre]] fresh [[Cookbook:rosehip|rosehips]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:L|litres]] [[Cookbook:water|water]]
* For each litre, 1 liquid quart of rosehip pulp

* 1/4 [[Cookbook:cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:almond|almonds]] 

==Method==
#Rinse the rosehips. Crush dried hips. Boil in water till soft.
#Press through a [[Cookbook:colander|colander]]. Measure the pulp and dilute with water if necessary. 
#Bring the pulp to a boil and add sugar. Add more sugar if it is too tart.
#Mix potato flour with some cold water. Thicken the soup while you stir and bring to a boil. Add blanched and shredded almond.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Hot soup is often served with vanilla ice cream and/or macaroons. 
*Cold soup can be diluted to make a nice thirst-quencher.
*The Icelandic recipe differs in that cornstarch is used to thicken it, not potato flour.

'''Potato Skins''' is a dish made with Potato halves with cheese and sometimes bacon, green onions, and sour cream sprinkled on top.

==Ingredients==
*8 small baking [[Cookbook:potato|potato]]es
*Vegetable oil
*Garlic salt
*2 [[Cookbook:cup|cup]]s (8 oz.) shredded [[Cookbook:Cheddar cheese|Cheddar cheese]]
*12 slices [[Cookbook:bacon|bacon]], cooked &amp; crumbled (optional)
*2 [[Cookbook:tablespoon|tablespoon]]s chopped fresh [[Cookbook:chive|chive]]s, divided

==Procedure==
Scrub potatoes and rub skins with oil. Prick each potato several times with a fork. Bake at 400 degrees for 30-45 minutes or until potatoes are done.
Allow potatoes to cool to touch. Cut top third off each potato; discard tops. Carefully scoop out pulp, leaving about 1/8 inch thick shells. (Reserve potato pulp for other uses.)

Fry potato skins in hot oil (375 degrees) for 3-4 minutes or until browned. Invert and drain on paper towels. Place potato skins, cut side up, on an ungreased baking sheet. Sprinkle with garlic salt and Cheddar cheese. Broil 6 inches from heat for 30 seconds or until cheese melts. Top potato skins with bacon if using them and 1 tablespoon chives.

Press green chiles between paper towels to remove excess moisture. Combine chilies, sour cream and red pepper in a small bowl; stir well. Top with remaining 1 tablespoon chives. Serve with potato skins.

Yield: 8 servings.

==Notes==
You don't have to make the chili sour cream.  You can just put a spoonful of sour cream right onto of the potato skin.

You can also bake these off in the oven to melt the cheese if you didn't want to fry them in oil.

== Procedure ==
# Grate the coconuts.  Separate the coconut from the milk of the coconut. Combine the coconut (reserve the milk) with the sugar.  Cook until a thick syrup is made. Remove from heat and to allow to rest.

[[Image:Pita.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Pita prepared on open fire]]

'''Pita''' (also known as ''pita bread'', ''arabic bread'' etc.) is a [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]]-made [[Cookbook:Wheat|wheat]] bread originating from North-African, to Middle-Eastern and to Mediterranean cuisines. It is usually eaten with sauces, dips and fillings. Known dishes that use pita are [[Cookbook:Kebab|kebab]], [[Cookbook:Gyros|gyros]], and [[Cookbook:Shwarma|shwarma]]. Pita is low in saturated fat and cholesterol. 100 grams (3½ oz.) of regular pita has about 250 calories.

==Ingredients==
* 2½ dl (1 cup) of warm water
* 25 g (1 oz.) of yeast
* 1 tsp. of salt
* 2 tbsp. of vegetable oil
* 5 dl (17 fl. oz) of durum wheat flour

== Procedure ==
# Dissolve the yeast in a bowl of warm water. Add salt, oil and flour, mix it, and knead it into a dough. 
# Let the dough rise to twice of its size. 
# Divide the risen dough into 8 pieces and shape them into balls. 
# Then roll the balls into flat and round pita breads (to a diameter of 15 cm or 6&quot;). 
# Let the breads rise in a warm place covered with a cloth for about 30 minutes. 
# Bake in 225°C (435°F) for about 12 minutes.

===Optional additions===
Cut the bread into two pieces so it can be used like a sandwich filled with salad or meat. Or the exact same, wrapped into a reel. Pita is delicious when dipped in sauces just like that, too. There are lots of possible ideas and combinations!

Makes 8 pitas.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is delicious warm or cold as a dessert or &quot;stand-alone&quot; cake, this simple and reliable recipe is tried and tested. Cuts into 8 slices.

==Ingredients==
* 5 [[Cookbook:ounce|ounces]] (145g) [[Cookbook:butter|butter]]
* 2 large [[Cookbook:egg|egg]]s
* 8 [[Cookbook:ounce|ounces]] (230g) [[Cookbook:Caster sugar|caster sugar]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:almond essence|almond essence]]
* 8 [[Cookbook:ounce|ounces]] (230g) [[Cookbook:Self Raising Flour|self-raising flour]]
* 1&amp;frac12; level [[Cookbook:teaspoon|teaspoons]] [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* approx. &amp;frac34; [[Cookbook:pound|pounds]] (330g) peeled cooking [[Cookbook:apple|apple]]s (Bramleys)
* [[Cookbook:Powdered Sugar|icing sugar]] to dredge

==Method==
* Grease a 9&quot; (23cm) loose-bottomed [[Cookbook:Springform Pan|spring-form cake tin]].
* Melt the butter in a pan gently, then pour into a large bowl.
* Add the eggs, sugar and almond essence and stir well until mixed. Then add the flour and baking powder. Stir well - at this point, it should be a stiff mixture.
* Spread just under two-thirds of the mixture into the cake tin.
* Immediately afterwards, peel, core and slice the apples and place on top of the mixture in the tin. Cover these with the remainder of the cake mixture. At this stage, the cake may appear &quot;untidy&quot;, but the cooking process eliminates most unevenness or gaps in the surface.
* Bake for 1¼ to 1½ hours in a pre-heated oven at 325 °F/160 °C/Gas Mark 3.

''Once cooked, allow to cool slightly in the tin, loosen the sides of the cake with a knife and gently push the cake out onto a plate. Lightly dust the top of the cake with sieved icing sugar once cool. Serve warm or cold, with cream for best results.''

==Storage==
This cake will last for at least 3-4 days, and can be re-heated as necessary. Keep covered or alternatively refrigerate.

This is a basic tartar sauce, suitable for fish and chips. The recipe is largely based on a trial and error recreation of the tartar sauce used at a local restaurant I frequent.

==Ingredients==
* 10 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounces]] (280g) [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]]&lt;!-- (240 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) --&gt;
* 2 &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ounces (65ml) [[Cookbook:Ketchup|ketchup]]
* 2 ounces (55ml) [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]]
* 2 ounces (55ml) [[Cookbook:Relish|relish]]
* &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Garlic Salt|garlic salt]]
* &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; teaspoon [[Cookbook:Celery Salt|celery salt]]

==Procedure==
# I suggest placing the [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]] in the mixing bowl first, and whipping it until it's smooth.
# Mix in the other ingredients

==Notes, tips, and variations==
* I've found that using [[Cookbook:Pickle Juice|pickle juice]] (and lowering the amount of relish) is often better. This is especially true if you plan on using this in a squeeze bottle (as the relish can block the opening if it's too thick/chunky).

Arepas are fried or baked yellow or white corn pancakes, either plain or with a filling. Most Venezuelans and Colombians eat them as part of their daily diet in place of bread, mostly at breakfast, at least in Colombia. They are one of the national dishes of Venezuela and there are many food stands or small restaurants called ''areperas'' which specialise in the making of these small delights.

Arepas have been an important staple in the diets of the poor Venezuelan's diet for centuries; today they are eaten by rich and poor alike. Originally they were made from dried corn kernels which were soaked in water and lime to remove the skins, then cooked, drained, dried and ground into flour. Thanks to modern technology, it is now possible to buy the masa harina (corn flour) ready to use, cutting out the lengthy soaking and drying process, which means they can be prepared in just a few minutes. 

Arepas can be eaten for breakfast; at any time of the day as a snack; as an appetiser or starter, especially when accompanied with a sauce; or as an accompaniment to a main course, much like bread rolls. They can be eaten plain; cooked with a filling of meat, poultry or cheese; simply split open and buttered; or filled like a sandwich. They can be poached, grilled, baked, griddled or (most often)  fried,  making them not only of the most traditional but also one of the most versatile foods in Venezuela.

==Ingredients==

* 2 2/5 cup (500g) [[Cookbook:corn flour|corn flour]] for arepas 
* 1 1/5 tsp [[Cookbook:salt|salt]] 
* 3/5 (140g) cup grated white [[Cookbook:cheese|cheese]] 
* 2 2/5 (500g) cup cool [[Cookbook:water|water]] (or more if needed) 

==Procedure==
# In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and white cheese. Stir in enough water to make a firm, slightly moist dough. Cover the dough and let it rest for 5 minutes. Divide the dough into 10 pieces and form each piece into a ball. Flatten the ball slightly.
# Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180c).
# Oil a griddle very lightly and warm it over medium heat. Cook the arepas on the griddle for about 5 minutes on each side, until a golden brown crust forms. Transfer the arepas to a baking sheet and bake 20 to 25 minutes, turning them several times as they bake. 

Serve immediately, with cheese, ham and black beans.

'''Pabellón Criollo''' is Venezuela's national dish and no visit to this South American country will be complete unless you try it. This flavorful dish consists of shredded flank steak, black beans, rice, plantains or bananas, onions, tomatoes, and spices.

Requires 2 days of advanced preparation. 

The '''hallaca''' (pronounced AH-JAC-KA) is the main Venezuelan Christmas dinner dish. It was created by the slaves during the colony times. They put the left-overs of their master's Christmas festivities in a bit of cornmeal dough, wrapped this with banana leaves and cooked to mix the flavors. As many things in my country, the hallaca has the influence of three cultures, the white one (European ingredients like raisins, nuts and olives), the native one (the corn meal colored with annatto seeds), and the black one (banana leaves used to cook the food). The original hallaca is made with meat (pork, poultry, beef, lard, crisp pork rind, etc) and boiled eggs. The hallaca tastes better once it has cooled. It requires hours of preparation, but it is usually prepared by the whole family. Its preparation is a celebration by itself. Music and drinks make up the festive atmosphere. Mothers nagging children as they steal bits of fillings from the table, and the guys complaining of being relegated to the leaf cleaning and last minute shopping are typical during the hallaca making party. 

''Please note: the banana leaves are not intended to be eaten, they are just for cooking!'' 

==Ingredients==

* 1 tsp of [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander seeds]]

* 1 roll of kitchen string 
* 1 Kg of [[Cookbook:Banana|banana leaves]] (for wrapping, not for eating!)
* 250 ml of [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* 1 vegetable [[Cookbook:Bouillon Cubes|stock cube]]

[[Cookbook:Marmite|Marmite]], [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soya sauce]] and [[Cookbook:Hot Pepper Sauce|chili sauce]] to season 

** OPTIONAL for overseas expatriates and daring cooks: 20mx30cm roll of strong [[Cookbook:Aluminum foil|aluminum foil]] (unless you are rich enough or have access to a Sedano's supermarket as to buy triple quantity of banana leaves and wrap the hallacas exclusively with banana leaves, in the Old Fashioned Way)(See Goya.Com for provenance within the US)

==Procedure==
Make sure you have enough friends and family to help you with the procedure below, and that they include people who know how to fold them once filled, wrap them and tie them properly... no kidding.

===Leaves===
# With a damp cloth wipe the banana leaves. 
# Heat the banana leaves with a flame (gas cooker, camping fire, etc). The leaves turn softer and darker, with a distinctive smoky smell. 
# Cut the hard rim without shredding the leaves. Cut in 30 cm segments along the transversal veins. 

===Polenta dough===
# In a small pan, warm (at very low heat) 5 Tsp of olive oil with the annatto seeds for 20 minutes. The oil should turn red. 
# In the meantime, fry in a deep pan the spices (cumin, black pepper, and coriander seeds) in 2-3 Tsp of olive oil. Cut the white onions in slices and add to the pan. Add 5 cups of boiling water. Add the stock cubes and a Tsp of Marmite to season. Add the green part of the leeks plus the white part of 2 leeks in 1-inch chunks. Cut 1 and a half packet of spring onions and add to the pan. Add all the herbs (keep some parsley to garnish) and the garlic head cut in halves. 
# Simmer this broth for 15 minutes. 
# Put the content of the pan in a food processor and liquidise it. 
# Strain it very well keeping the liquid and discarding the solid waste (may want it to make vegetable cakes, up to you). Put the broth in a large bowl and add the red oil (previously strained to remove the annatto seeds). 
# Pour the water content of the olive and the caper jars in the bowl. Add the polenta meal, 1 cup at a time, stirring very well. The consistency should be smooth. Mix the mashed potatoes with the polenta dough. 
# Make a small test for the consistency of the dough. Wrap 1 Tsp of dough with a small segment of banana leaf. Wrap it in aluminum foil and boil it in water for 15 minutes. If the cooked dough maintain the shape of the banana leaf &quot;package&quot;, the dough is OK. If it crumbles or comes out half dissolved in water, then add more polenta meal. If it comes out rock hard, then add more water to the dough. Rectify the salt as well. 

===Fillings===
# Grill peppers: Rub olive oil in two red bell peppers and grill them. 
# Remove the skin and seeds and cut in 1cm wide strips. 
# Put them apart in a small bowl. 

===Sauce===
# Slice two red onions. Chop the rest of the spring onions and a leek. 
# Stir fry quickly. 
# Liquidise the ''mi-cuit'' tomatoes, two red peppers and two green peppers and add to the stir fry onions and leek. Stir for a minute. 
# Add soya sauce, chili sauce and ground cumin to season. Add some cooking wine if you want. Let it simmer for another minute. 
# Add some wheat or corn flour to thicken. Put the sauce apart in a bowl. 

===Small bowls===

# Vegetables: shred the carrots and Brussels sprouts, mix with the green beans, chopped. Put them apart in a bowl. 
# Soak the vine fruit in cooking wine or replacement. Put it apart in a small bowl. 
# Soak prunes in cooking wine or replacement. Put in a small bowl. 
# Drain chickpeas and put them apart in a small bowl. 
# Put pickles apart in a small bowl. 
# Blanch and toast the almonds, and put them apart in a small bowl. 
# Drain and chop the mock duck into 1cm cubes and put them in a small bowl. 
# Put the olives apart in a small bowl. 
# Put the capers apart in a small bowl. 
# Drain the artichoke hearts, cut in quarters and put them in a small bowl. 
# Drain the asparagus and put it in a plate. 

===Hallaca===
[[Image:Ingredientes fundamentales de la Hallaca.JPG|right|thumb|Wrapping the hallaca]]
# Cut a 35 cm long piece of aluminum foil and put it over the table. Cover with a banana leaf, the transversal veins along the horizontal axis. Rub oil on front face of the banana leaf. Put a bit more than half a ladle of dough in the centre of the leaf. Extend with a spoon to cover a 14cm-diameter circle. 
# Put 1 Tsp of Sauce in the middle. Put 1½ Tsp of shredded vegetables over the sauce. Put 2 olives and 2 capers, one on each corner of the dough. Keep placing the rest of the fillings as in a collage: 1 tsp. of vine fruit, 1 prune, 2 tsp. of pickles, 1 Tsp of chickpeas, 3 cubes of mock duck, 1 asparagus, 2 strips of grill pepper and some leaves of parsley. 
# Wrap this with the banana leaf (not against the veins). Fold the foil to seal the ends of the banana leaf packet. Then, fold the foil to wrap the whole packet. Tie it with kitchen string. Repeat for the rest of the dough (see diagrams below). 
# Boil the hallacas covered in water for 20-30 minutes. You may have to do this in batches unless you have a huge cauldron. Drain the hallacas and let them cool for 10 hours. Put them in the fridge or freezer. Heat the hallacas in boiling water, simmering for 10 minutes before eat them. Enjoy your meal!

*1/2 teaspoon ground cumin seeds
*1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary

==Ingredients==
* 1 kg beef cut into big cubes to make 20 pieces
* 4 [[Cookbook:Kaffir Lime Leaf|lime leaves]] 
* 1 stalk [[Cookbook:Lemongrass|lemongrass]] 
* 2 liter ready-to-use [[Cookbook:Coconut milk|coconut milk]] or coconut milk from 1 big fresh coconut

Spice paste, using food processor grind the following ingredients:
* 2 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] 
* 4 [[Cookbook:Shallot|shallot]]
* 25 g [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]] 
* 15 g [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]] 
* 75 g young [[Cookbook:Galangal|galangal]] 
* 1 tbl. [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|ground fresh red chili pepper]] 
* 1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] 
* 1/2 dried [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]] 
* 2 [[Cookbook:Candlenut|candlenut]] 
* 1/2 tbl. salt
* 1 tbs. [[Cookbook:Gula Jawa|Gula Jawa]] (Indonesian Palm Sugar)

==Directions==
#Marinate meat with the spice paste for at least 1 hour
#In a pan, stir occasionally while cooking coconut milk over slow fire until some oil surfaces from the coconut milk (at least for 20 minutes)
#Put 300 cc of coconut milk to cover the marinated meat and all the spices (including lime leaves and lemon grass) in a big wok (the bigger the better) and cook over slow to medium fire while occasionally stir the ingredients until half of the coconut milk is evaporated
#Pour 100 cc of coconut milk and stir until almost all of the coconut milk is evaporated
#Keep on stirring and pouring the rest of the coconut milk, 100 cc at a time
#Cook for until the meat is tender (at least one and a half hour) and almost all the liquid from the coconut milk is evaporated and turned into spicy condiments

==Notes, tips and variations==
*When cooled, the coconut oil in the rendang may solidify. Reheat in a pan before serving. A reheated rendang often has better flavor
*Fresh coconut milk produces a better gravy
*Chicken or mutton can be used in place of beef
*Beef liver may be used but produces a darker gravy

#Serve with hot steamed rice or slices of lontong (steamed rice roll)

==Notes, tips and variations==
* Many versions of soto Ayam dont have tomato.
* Some prefer not to mix cabbage with bean sprouts.
* As fried potato substitute, some like to put potato chips into the soup.

A fresh Seitan sausage is similar to a [[w:Bratwurst|Bratwurst]]. Gluten inflates in a hot pan but deflates nearly as quickly when it cools down. The cooled down sausage may look somewhat flat but tastes as well as the spices you used (gluten is almost without taste). With sausage spices, especially [[w:Curry|Curry]] you can create a vegetarian Bratwurst or [[w:Currywurst|Currywurst]] few unaware meat eaters would suspect to be vegetarian.

==Ingredients==

* [[Cookbook:Gluten|Gluten]] (see [[Cookbook:Seitan|Seitan]] for how to gain gluten from wheat flour)
* Water, [[Cookbook:Soy_sauce|Soy sauce]], [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|Vegetable oil]]
* additional spices, e.g.: [[Cookbook:Coriander|Coriander]], [[Cookbook:Cardamom|Cardamom]], [[Cookbook:Thyme|Thyme]] and [[Cookbook:Oregano|Oregano]]
* optional: [[Cookbook:Tofu|Tofu]]

==Procedure==
* Use 25% (volume) more water than gluten flour.
* Mix liquid ingredients (e.g. soy sauce) with the water.
* Mix solid ingredients (e.g. spices) with the flour. It is much easier to mix solid and liquid ingredients separately than adding ingredients to the gluten dough later, as it is very rubbery and sticky.
* mashed tofu can be added to the solid ingredients because tofu remains juicier after longer roasting. 
* Make gluten dough from 100% gluten flour (or use wheat flour, see [[Cookbook:Seitan|Seitan]]) and water. The dough should be suitable for kneading. Knead the dough until it is well combined and allow it to rest for 10 minutes.
* Roll the dough into sausages and fry them in a pan.
* To fry the sausages an oiled non-stick pan is recommended. To fry the sausages on a grill they must be cooked first in order to make the gluten dough less rubbery.
* The gluten inflates but is also bit runny. To form round sausages you have to turn them on all sides and squeeze from both sides with two [[w:Spatula|spatulas]].
* For an original Currywurst you add [[w:Ketchup|Ketchup]] and sprinkle Curry on the sausage.

== Attention ==

* If the sausages aren't eaten fresh they deflate a lot but still taste good. (You clearly have to recognize the inner values over the outer appearance here).

'''Whipped cream''' is a stable aerated form of [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]], usually with [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]], [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] or other flavors added. It's traditionally produced by whipping air into heavy cream.

It's often served on top of desserts such as [[Cookbook:Pie|pie]], [[Cookbook:Vanilla Ice Cream|ice cream]], and strawberries. It's also used to give mousses their fluffy texture, by gently folding it into a flavoring substance such as chocolate. It can also be used as a [[Cookbook:Leavening agent|leavening agent]] for batters.

Pre-whipped cream can be bought at grocery stores in both tubs and spray tubes.

==Ingredients:==
*1 cup(0.25 l) heavy cream (or whipping cream), cold

==Procedure==
# Chill a medium mixing bowl and the beaters of an electric mixer in the refrigerator for at least 10 minutes. (If using a mixer with various kinds of beaters, use the [[Cookbook:Whisk|whisk]] attachment). This step is very important, because the cream will not rise if the mixer is warm.
# In the chilled bowl, beat heavy cream until soft peaks form. Do not overbeat.

Makes: 2 cups/0.5 l

== Tips, Notes and Variations ==
* Contrary to whipping egg whites, it's not important to make sure there's no fat in the mixture. It is important, however, to make sure that the bowl and mixers are dry.
* To sweeten the cream, about two tablespoons of sugar per cup (0.25 l) of heavy cream are appropriate.

'''Cochinita pibil''' (also '''puerco pibil''') is a traditional [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Mexico|Mexican]] slow-roasted pork dish from the [[Wikipedia:Yucatán|Yucatán]].

This version of the dish was adapted from [[Wikipedia:Robert Rodríguez|Robert Rodríguez]]'s DVD extras on ''[[Wikipedia:Once Upon a Time in Mexico|Once Upon a Time in Mexico]]''.  

==Ingredients==

* 5 [[Cookbook:tablespoon|Tbsps.]] (75 ml) [[Cookbook:annatto|annatto]] seeds
* 2 [[Cookbook:teaspoon|tsps.]] (10 ml) [[Cookbook:cumin|cumin]] seeds
* 1 Tbsp. (15 ml) [[Cookbook:black pepper|peppercorns]]
* 8 [[Cookbook:allspice|allspice]] berries
* ½ tsp. (8 ml) whole [[Cookbook:clove|cloves]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:chile peppers|habanero chile]]s (or milder chile)
* ½ [[Cookbook:cup|cup]] (120 ml) [[Cookbook:orange |orange]] juice
* ½ cup (120 ml) white [[Cookbook:vinegar|vinegar]]
* 2 Tbsps. (30 ml) [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
* 8 cloves of [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic]]
* juice of 5 [[Cookbook:lemon|lemon]]s
* splash of [[Cookbook:tequila|tequila]]
* 5 pounds (2.3 kg) [[Cookbook:pork|pork]] butt
* [[Cookbook:Banana|banana]] leaves and/or heavy-duty [[Cookbook:aluminum foil|aluminum foil]]
* white or Spanish [[Cookbook:rice|rice]], [[Cookbook:taco|taco]] shells, or [[Cookbook:tortilla|tortilla]]s for serving

== Procedure ==

# Place the annatto, cumin, peppercorns, allspice, and cloves in a spice grinder and process to a '''fine''' powder.  (You can use an electric coffee grinder for the spices, but it will not be suitable for coffee afterwards.)
# Remove the seeds and veins from the habanero chiles and chop coarsely. (If you want a hotter dish, leave some of the veins and seeds in.  If you want a milder dish, substitute a milder chile.)
# Process the orange juice, vinegar, chiles, salt, garlic, and the powder you made in step 1 in a [[Cookbook:blender|blender]] or [[Cookbook:food processor|food processor]] until liquefied. Add the lemon juice and tequila.
# Cut the pork into 2 inch (5 cm) chunks.  Leave the fat on the meat, to keep the pork moist while roasting; you can remove it after cooking if you wish. Place in a large, self-sealing plastic bag with the [[Cookbook:marination|marinade]]. Seal bag and turn to evenly coat the meat. Refrigerate for 8 to 24 hours, turning occasionally.
# Heat oven to 325° F (160° C).  Dump the meat and the marinade in a roasting pan lined with banana leaves or foil, making sure to wrap tightly so no steam escapes.  If using banana leaves, an outer wrapping with foil will help seal in the steam.  [[Cookbook:Roast|Roast]] for 4 hours. Open packet carefully; the meat should shred easily with a fork.
# Serve over rice, or shred and serve with taco shells or tortillas.

This vegetable soup is a must-have item on the menu of every West Java (Sundanese) restaurant in Indonesia. This soup has some kind of appetizing effect because of the use of tamarind or (dried) sour starfuit as one of the ingredients.

This is a simple dish for 4-5 people, but it does take time.

== Ingredients ==

*900g boneless chuck [[Cookbook:beef|beef]], snipped into 3cm pieces and rolled in flour
*unsalted [[Cookbook:butter|butter]]
*1 clove [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic]]
*5/4 cups [[Cookbook:burgundy|burgundy]]
*small [[Cookbook:bay leaf|bay leaf]]
*5/4 teaspoon [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
*2 stalks [[Cookbook:parsley|parsley]]
*25g [[Cookbook:pancetta|pancetta]], diced
*18 [[Cookbook:pickling onion|pickling onion]]s peeled
*1 Tablespoon [[Cookbook:tomato puree|tomato puree]]
*1/2 teaspoon dried [[Cookbook:thyme|thyme]]
*1/2 teaspoon ground [[Cookbook:asafoetida|asafoetida]]
*1/4 teaspoon ground [[Cookbook:black pepper|black pepper]]
*18 [[Cookbook:mushroom|mushroom]] caps
*1 Tablespoon [[Cookbook:olive oil|olive oil]]

== Utensils ==
Wide [[Cookbook:frying pan|frying pan]] and [[Cookbook:casserole dish|casserole dish]] with lid

== Procedure ==

# [[Cookbook:Brown|Brown]] the beef in olive oil in the pan, then add the garlic for 1 min before removing. 
# Put the beef in the casserole dish (without the garlic) - add the wine and then enough hot water to barely cover the meat. Add the bay leaf, salt and parsley and put in an oven at 190 °C for 2 hours.
# [[Cookbook:pan fry|Fry]] the pancetta in the pan, then add the onions and brown all over. Add to the casserole and cook for an extra 1/2 hour in the oven.
# Fry the mushrooms in the pan with butter.
# Stir the puree, thyme, asafoetida and pepper into the casserole and return to the oven for an extra 10 mins. Then spoon off the fat and adjust the salt.
# Spread the mushrooms over the beef and serve from the casserole with [[Cookbook:Colcannon|colcannon]] and steamed [[Cookbook:vegetables|vegetables]]

The beef should be tender, and the sauce quite rich. The pickling onions come out sweet. The [[Cookbook:Asafoetida|asafoetida]] is a novelty, but is extremely good for adding a little pungency to stews.

#In the skillet, fry pancetta and porkbelly fat with butter till golden brown. Remove pancetta.
#To the skillet, add the seasoned chicken pieces skin side down and fry until honey-coloured, then turn. This is vital for the flavour; the skillet must be left sticky. There won't be enough room to do it in one go, so take it in turns. Remove, leaving the porkbelly behind, snipped into pieces. (If you're doing breasts off the bone, sear on skin side only and do not put back into the dish until the oven stage - otherwise they will toughen up.)
#To the skillet add the chopped onion and the button mushrooms; fry for 5 mins, then add the sliced garlic and immediately flame off one of the measures of brandy.
#To the skillet add the chicken pieces and pancetta, then pour over all the wine and the chicken &amp; veg stocks. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and, adding the crushed garlic and herbs, simmer for 45 mins. Turn the chicken pieces twice. Remove the chicken pieces to the pyrex lid and pour the skillet sauce into the jug; put the jug in the freezer for 30 mins and then remove the fat. At this stage, it is recommended that you refrigerate the whole dish overnight.
#In the skillet, add some butter along with the wild mushrooms; then pickling onions, carrots and celery; fry till mushrooms brown. Stir in the asafoetida and flame off the second measure of brandy.
#Add the jug ingredients to the skillet sauce, along with another crushed clove of garlic, and push the veg to the edge of the skillet; reduce the sauce in the skillet until glossy (may need flour stirred in - but it shouldn't be thick): 15 mins.
#Pour half the sauce into the pyrex bowl, then place the chicken pieces in, and pour the rest of the sauce on top; put the covered pyrex bowl in an oven on 170 C for 90 mins.
#Sprinkle parsley over each portion, and serve with asparagus/green beans, and steamed potatoes/flat noodles/rice/orzo/[[Cookbook:Colcannon|colcannon]].

This is a difficult dish, but you've got to try it. The asafoetida is a novelty, but it does add pungency.

== Ingredients ==

*1 2⁄3 cup [[Cookbook:Falafel|falafel mix]]
*1 1/4 cup water
* 1 head red leaf lettuce
* 3 tomatoes
* 1 cucumber

* 1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Tahini Yogurt Sauce|Tahini Yogurt Sauce]]

== Procedures == 
=== Prepare Falafel ===
* In a large bowl, add water to falafel mix and stir well. 
* Let stand 15 minutes to absorb the water. 
* Form mix into 3/4 inch balls.

==== Baked! ====
Baked is delicious and healthy.

* Place balls into mini-cupcake tins or onto a cookie sheet. 
* Bake in oven at 375 for 12 minutes.

==== Fried! ====
For a more traditional falafel ball, 
* Heat about 1⁄2-inch vegetable oil to 375°F. 
* Fry balls until brown and crisp (about 3 minutes). 
* Drain and set aside.

=== Prepare Veggies ===
* Clean and chop lettuce.
* Quarter the tomatoes. Chop again until large bite size.
* Peel and slice cucumber.

Toss vegetables with falafels and douse with tahini yogurt sauce. Falafel may be cold or hot for a delicious salad straight outta the PNW.

== Notes, tips, and variations ==
Thanks to dry falafel mix and the nature of simple salads, this recipe is pretty fast and easy. Look in the bulk bins at your local hippie grocery store for dry falafel mix.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Meat Recipes|Meat Recipes]] | [[Cookbook:Midwestern cuisine|Midwest]]

Cashew chicken was invented at Leong's Tea House in Springfield, Missouri.  Leong had difficulty popularizing Chinese cuisine in the area and based the dish on the popular fried foods common in the Ozarks.  The dish is not truly Chinese, rather an American dish with a &quot;Chinese&quot; theme.

Note that there is also an unbreaded [[Cookbook:Cashew Chicken|Cashew Chicken]] recipe with softened cashews.

==Main Ingredients==
* chicken breast
* flour
* eggs
* milk
* salt
* cashews
* green onions

==Sauce Ingredients==
* chicken broth
* cornstarch
* soy sauce
* oyster sauce

==Procedure==
Debone and cut chicken breasts into bite-sized pieces.  Scramble eggs and mix with milk.  Dip breasts into egg/milk combination, then into flour (add a dash of salt) and deep fry.

For the sauce, take one can chicken broth and add 1 tablespoon cornstarch and heat in a saucepan on low to medium heat.  Add 2 tablespoons each oyster sauce and soy sauce or to taste.  Continue to add cornstarch as needed while heating until it reaches a thicker consistency.  

Serve chicken on fried rice, cover liberally with sauce and garnish with cashews (chopped, if desired) and chopped green onions.

A delicious chocolate cake recipe.

==Ingredients==
[[Image:Atomicfudge1.JPG|thumb|Atomic Fudge Cake]]
*3 cups (710 ml) [[Cookbook:sugar|sugar]]
*1 ¾ cup (415ml) [[Cookbook:flour|flour]]
*1 ¾ cups (415ml) baking [[Cookbook:cocoa|cocoa]]
*1 ½ teaspoon (7 ml) [[Cookbook:baking soda|baking soda]]
*1 ½ teaspoon (7 ml) [[Cookbook:baking powder|baking powder]]
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:salt|salt]] (5ml)
*2 [[Cookbook:egg|egg]]s
*1 cup(235 ml) [[Cookbook:milk|milk]]
*½ cup (120 ml) [[Cookbook:vegetable oil|vegetable oil]]
*2 teaspoons (10 ml) [[Cookbook:vanilla extract|vanilla extract]]
*1 cup (235 ml)boiling [[Cookbook:water|water]]

== Procedure ==
#mix the dry ingredients well in a large bowl. For better texture, sift them together.
#Add the eggs, milk, vanilla and vegetable oil and mix well. Then add the water. Mix it until it has a lot of little bubbles. This batter will be very thin.
#Pour into two greased 9 inch round baking pans
#[[Cookbook:Bake|Bake]] in a preheated oven at 350 °F (175 °C) for thirty minutes. (About 20 minutes for a convection oven)

== Frosting/filling ==
[[Image:Atomicfudge2.JPG|thumb|right|Atomic Fudge Cake]]
Note: this should only be done after the cake has cooled and is ready for frosting.
*1/8th cup (30 ml) [[Cookbook:cocoa|cocoa]]
*7 oz (200 g) [[Cookbook:dark chocolate|dark chocolate]]
*1/8th cup (30 ml) boiling [[Cookbook:water|water]]
*1/16th cup (15 ml) [[Cookbook:sugar|sugar]] or [[Cookbook:powdered sugar|powdered sugar]]
*2/3rds cup (156 ml) [[Cookbook:whipping cream|whipping cream]]

warning: don't try and substitute baker's chocolate for the dark chocolate. The huge amount of sugar you'd have to add would be a pain, especially if using the powdered sugar, and if you use regular sugar, it gets grainy and crunchy. Also, to make things more interesting, spices such as [[Cookbook:cinnamon|cinnamon]] can be added, if so desired.

#Melt the chocolate by placing it in a small bowl or pot and placing that in boiling water.
#Mix the sugar and cocoa together in a small bowl and mix in the water. 
#Stir the sugar/cocoa/water mix into the melted chocolate
#quickly stir in the cream and mix until it has a nice smooth consistancy.
#Immediately 'frost' the cake with this, and make sure that there is quite a bit between the two layers of cake. The cake will need to be refrigerated to harden the fudge, so don't worry about its relatively liquid nature.
#Refrigerate Cake

This cake is meant to be served warm - that is, after being refrigerated. So, slice a piece and microwave it for about 20 seconds. It is heavenly as the fudge melts and soaks into the cake. Serve with ice cream if you so desire.
One final note: a higher quality of chocolate and baking cocoa will make a HUGE difference in this cake. It is very worth the extra expense.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Meat Recipes|Meat Recipes]]

'''Curry &amp; Honey Chicken''' - This dish was an idea I got out of nowhere, and turned out to be an unbelievable delicacy. Due to the experimental birth of this recipe, the measures given are very vague and approximate and can be altered freely. The almonds can be omitted and if you make your rice a little more interesting (I tried flavouring it with Mexican-ish tomato soup, tasted great), then you can leave out the vegetable mix altogether.

==Ingredients==
* 4 [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] breasts
* 1 handful of [[Cookbook:Almond|almonds]]
* 1 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Curry Powder|curry powder]]
* 3 tablespoons of [[Cookbook:honey|honey]] ([[Cookbook:Maple Syrup|maple syrup]] has even better results, if you can get it)
* 1/2 or 1 cup (120ml or 240ml) [[Cookbook:vegetable oil|vegetable oil]] or [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* vegetable mix - I recommend 1 [[Cookbook:onion|onion]] (can be substituted with [[Cookbook:leek|leek]]), 1 [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|red pepper]], 2-4 [[Cookbook:tomato|tomato]]es, 1-3 [[Cookbook:celery|celery]] greens (if you add more, they can dominate the mix - interesting for a change), 1 [[Cookbook:zucchini|zucchini]] or [[Cookbook:eggplant|eggplant]], and you can add a lot more.
* For special occasions, [[Cookbook:cherry tomato|cherry tomato]]es will make the meal very interesting (due to the contrast between the sweet chicken, bitter celery and sour tomatoes).
* What also makes the meal a lot better is adding cubes of [[Cookbook:mango|mango]] to the meat just before it's done (and frying them a bit - you need to put salt on them, and don't hesitate, it tastes great when it's stronger). [[Cookbook:Kiwi|Kiwifruit]] works too, but not as well. Any sour-ish hard [[Cookbook:fruit|fruit]] should do the trick. [[Cookbook:banana|Banana]] is good too, but doesn't offer the same contrast.
* [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]]

==Preparation==
#[[Cookbook:Marinate|Marinate]] chicken at least 6 hours before preparing the meal. 24 hours is best. Marinate in honey (or maple syrup), curry, oil, salt (1 heaping teaspoon per kilogram of chicken works very well). Adding parsley, celery leaves or something similar adds a fine taste.
#Peel almonds ([[Cookbook:boil|boil]] in small amount of water for a minute or two, let cool, squeeze out of peeling)

==Procedure==
#Chop onion/leek finely and fry lightly on a large [[Cookbook:frying pan|frying pan]] with a bit of oil.
#Add vegetables, roughly in the order you find logical (i.e., tomatoes don't take long, zucchini (courgette) can be in the pan from the start of cooking)
#Add salt, about 1/2 teaspoon, add more if the taste doesn't seem right. The salt will extract water from the vegetables and make them 'stew' faster. You can cover the pan if it goes slowly - once again, this slows the evaporation and allows the vegetables to cook in the water they lose.
#Dump the vegetables into a bowl or a small pot to keep them warm and use the remaining oil to fry the cherry tomatoes, if you have those - once done, keep them separate from the other vegetables.
#Fry almonds gently on the pan.
#Add chicken meat, fry on high temperature quickly - when it looks done, cut the largest piece open to see if it is done inside as well. The pieces should be lightly browned. Don't worry, this is the sugar in the honey turning to caramel.
#Serve: Keep rice / vegetables / meat separate on plate, add cherry tomatoes in the center, about 2-4 a dish.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Soups|Soups]]

'''Mexican Tomato Soup''' - A very simple dish, can be made hot if wanted. Very nutritious for a soup too.

==Ingredients==
* About 1/2 litre tomato sauce/purée or similar. Pure is good - don't use ketchup, or only very good ketchup. I used bio purée.
* 2 large onions or equivalent
* 2 red peppers
* 2 tomatoes
* Some greens. Onion greens work, leek does as well.
* 1 can of sweet corn
* 1/4 cup (60ml) vegetable/olive oil, salt, sugar
* More vegetables according to your taste

==Procedure==
#Cut onion fine and fry lightly in a large sauce pan with a bit of oil.
#Add vegetables, roughly in the order you find logical (ie, tomatoes don't take long, peppers can be there from the start).
#Add salt, about 1/2 teaspoon, and add if the taste doesn't feel right. The salt will extract water from the vegetables and make them 'stew' faster. You can cover the pot if it goes slowly - once again, this slows the evaporation and allows the vegetables to cook in the water they lose themselves.
#Add tomato sauce and corn.
#Add salt, sugar to taste. Be bold, tomato sauce takes a '''lot''' of salt and at least a heaping teaspoon of sugar to taste right. If unsure, seperate a small amount and try adding more salt - you will see the tastes changes significantly.
#Serve with tortilla chips, or toasted bread if not available.

Alternately it is shaped into a couple of large rings with shell-on hard boiled eggs embedded in the dough at the cardinal points. The eggs were a symbol of resurrection and the four directions the sign of the cross.

Don't forget the sweet glaze; 1lb (450g) of [[Cookbook:Powdered Sugar|confectioners' sugar]] enough water to make it spreadable. Spread on each loaf and cover generously with colorful sprinkles!

Charcoal grilled squid, prawn and fish kebabs in Zhoug sauce (a spicy dipping sauce that can be used in a variety of different ways). The original recipe called for octopus, but I've expanded it with good results. Also, note that the original recipe didn't call for white wine in the marinade.

==Ingredients==

'''Kebabs'''

* ½ kg large prawns / [[Cookbook:Shrimp|shrimp]], peeled and deveined
* ½ kg fish fillets, cut into 2½ cm (1 in) cubes
* ½ kg [[Cookbook:Squid|squid]], cleaned and cut into 2½ cm (1 in) pieces

'''Marinade'''

* 5 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], peeled and finely chopped
* 2 bay leaves
* 2 [[Cookbook:Jalapeño|jalapeños]], seeded and finely chopped
* 1 cup (240ml) lemon juice
* 1 tsp ground black pepper
* ¾ cup (180ml) [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|extra virgin olive oil]]
* ¾ cup (180ml) dry white wine

'''Zhoug sauce'''

* 1 cup (240g) [[Cookbook:Cilantro|coriander leaves]], washed, dried and chopped 
* 1 cup (240g) [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]], washed, dried and chopped
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Caraway|caraway]] seeds
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]] seeds
* 1½ tsp [[Cookbook:Cardamom|cardamom]] seeds
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Black pepper|black peppercorns]]
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Garam Masala|garam masala]]
* 8 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], peeled and crushed
* 8 [[Cookbook:Jalapeno|jalapeños]], seeded and chopped (adjust the quantity according to your heat tolerance)
* ¼ cup (60ml) [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|extra virgin olive oil]]

==Procedure==

Combine all the marinade ingredients in a nonreactive (glass or ceramic) mixing bowl. Add the seafood and mix to coat well. Refrigerate overnight.

Dry roast the cumin, caraway and cardomom seeds for two or three minutes in a cast iron skillet or wok over low heat. Cool, then add the peppercorns and pound in a mortar and pestle to a fine powder.

In a blender or food processor, blend the coriander, parsley, spices, garlic, chilli peppers and olive oil together with half a cup of water until a thick, smooth paste is formed.

Transfer the paste into a sauce pan, heat until it starts bubbling, then reduce the heat and simmer, stirring constantly, until the water is evaporated. Cool, transfer to an airtight container and chill.

Remove the seafood from the marinade and drain in a colander. Save the marinade for basting the kebabs later. Thread the seafood onto skewers or satay sticks.

Char-grill the kebabs over hot coals, basting and turning every few minutes. It should take about ten minutes to cook.

When eating, use the zhoug sauce as a dipping sauce.

Serves 8

Moutabbal (Baba Ghanouzh)
Eggplant and Tahini Puree

== Ingredients ==
* 1 large ripe [[Cookbook:Eggplant|eggplant]] (aubergine)
* 2 - 3 tablespoons (30-45g) [[Cookbook:Tahini|tahini]]
* 1 - 2 [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemons]], juiced and strained
* 2 - 3 cloves fresh [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* Salt
* [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|Olive oil]]

== Procedure ==
Roast the eggplant on open gas flame - range top or barbecue. If your stove is electric, split the eggplant lengthwise, place face down on cookie sheet and bake in hot oven on top rack 30-45 minutes. For open flame roasting, use a fork to turn often. Skin will wrinkle and char, and flesh will shrivel and become soft. When eggplant is completely soft all over, remove to a bowl, slash once or twice to drain out bitter juice, and let rest until cool enough to handle. Some authors suggest cooling the eggplant inside a brown paper bag.

Cut off stem and peel away skin. Scrape flesh into bowl of food processor or blender. Add garlic, tahini, lemon juice and process. Amounts depend upon size of eggplant and your taste - please sample frequently. Salt to taste.

If you don't have a food processor or blender, the eggplant is quite easy to mash by hand. Mash the garlic with the flat of a broad knife, then mince it fine. If you have a mortar and pestle, mash the garlic with salt into a paste. A large mortar and pestle can be used to mash all ingredients.

Serve at room temperature, drizzled with olive oil, garnished with a black or green Mediterranean olive, or sprigs of cilantro or parsley.

This is my grandmother's recipe, she refuses to measure things, so these are all approximates.  It makes enough food for at least 4 people.

== Ingredients ==
* 1 whole [[Cookbook:chicken|chicken]], cut up (skin optional) 
* 2 standard size containers of [[Cookbook:sour cream|sour cream]]
* [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]]
* [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]] (not [[Cookbook:red onion|red]])
* 2-3 cups (480g - 700g) [[Cookbook:flour|flour]]
* 2-3 [[Cookbook:egg|egg]]s
* [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* [[cookboo:Bacon grease|bacon grease]] or [[Cookbook:oil|oil]]

== Equipment ==
* big pot
* pan with lid (or an old plate to cover)

== Procedure ==

Put on a (BIG) pot of water to [[Cookbook:boil|boil]] (for dumplings)

=== Chicken ===
# [[Cookbook:Chop|Chop]] up onions (we like them done very small to hide them from the kids) and [[Cookbook:brown|brown]] them in your pan (the heavier the better) with some bacon grease (traditional) or lard or your preferred kind of oil (healthier but, if you ''must'', then use olive oil for flavor). 
# When the onions have softened and well colored, add the chicken to the pan. Brown rapidly, then season with paprika (to taste), turn heat down, add enough water added to cover the bottom of the pan and cook on low. Keep covered but with the lid slightly cocked to prevent boiling.
 
=== Dumplings ===
Make these while the chicken is cooking.

# Take flour, eggs, salt (just a pinch) and water at room temperature (to be added as needed) and mix to a sticky consistency (for dumplings to be ‘sticky’ inside have wetter dough; for dry the same all through, make a dryer dough).
# Use a desert spoon (or a [[Cookbook:melon-baller|melon-baller]] for smaller dumplings) to drop dough into boiling water (to keep them from sticking to the spoon, let it heat up in the water).
# When the dumpling floats, its done. Remove, put in a bowl (a ''tiny'' slick of melted fat/oil on the bottom might help if they stick) and keep them to one side in a warm place.

=== Assembly ===
# Now your chicken is cooked (chicken should be cooked to 160&amp;nbsp;°F) and your dumplings are all done (make sure they are thoroughly drained).
# Add dumplings and sour cream to pan, stir thoroughly but carefully to coat.
# Add more paprika, until it is more pink (or orange) than white.
# Taste sauce: it may need more paprika or salt. Sometimes it is easier to remove the chicken, and then pour the dumplings and sour cream over the top to coat (when serving), depending on how big your pan is.

Use [[Cookbook:rye bread|rye bread]] (with seeds) to sop up the sauce when you're done eating.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Sandwiches|Sandwiches]]

The '''Reuben''' or '''Reuben sandwich''' is a grilled or toasted sandwich made with corned beef, sauerkraut, Swiss cheese, and Russian dressing. It is typically made with rye bread though originally it may have been served on pumpernickel bread.

The origins of the Reuben are contested. One account holds that Reuben Kulakofsky (sometimes spelled Reubin), a grocer from Omaha, Nebraska, was the inventor, perhaps as part of a group effort by members of Kulakofsky's weekly poker game held in the Blackstone Hotel from ca. 1920-1935. The participants, who nicknamed themselves &quot;the committee,&quot; included the hotel's owner, Charles Schimmel. The sandwich first gained local fame when Schimmel put it on the Blackstone's lunch menu.

==Authentic Recipe==

=== Ingredients ===
* ½ pound (225g) sliced [[Cookbook:Beef|corned beef]]
* ¼ cup (60ml) drained [[Cookbook:Sauerkraut|sauerkraut]]
* 2 tablespoons chopped [[Cookbook:Onion|sweet onion]]
* 2 tablespoons creamy [[Cookbook:Russian Dressing|Russian dressing]]
* 2 slices [[Cookbook:Rye|rye]] [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]
* 1-3 slices [[Cookbook:Swiss Cheese|Swiss cheese]]
* chopped [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]]
* 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]

=== Procedure ===

# Combine the sauerkraut, onion, and parsley
# Spread the dressing on two slices bread
# Pile layers of corned beef, cheese, and sauerkraut mixture on one slice
# Add second slice of bread
# Butter the outside of the bread
# Grill until lightly browned, roughly 5 minutes

==Modern Variation==

===Ingredients===

* 12 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounces]] thinly sliced cooked corned [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] or deli corned beef 
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], softened 
* 8 slices [[Cookbook:Rye|rye]] or pumpernickel bread
* 8 slices [[Cookbook:Swiss Cheese|Swiss cheese]]
* 1½ cups [[Cookbook:Sauerkraut|sauerkraut]], well drained
* ¼ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Thousand Island Dressing|Thousand Island dressing]]

===Procedure===

# Lightly spread butter on one side of each bread slice.
# Heat large non-stick [[Cookbook:Skillet|skillet]] over medium heat until hot.
# Place 2 bread slices, butter side down, in skillet.
# Top each bread slice with 2 slices cheese, 1 tablespoon dressing, 3 ounces corned beef and ¼ of the sauerkraut.
# Top sandwich with bread slice, butter side up.
# Cook sandwiches 4 to 6 minutes or until bread is golden brown and cheese is melted, turning once.
# Repeat with remaining sandwiches.
# Serve with additional Thousand Island dressing, if desired.

== Notes, tips, and variations ==

* A modern variation of the Reuben substitutes [[Cookbook:Thousand Island Dressing|Thousand Island Dressing]] for the traditional Russian dressing.
* The Reuben has a &quot;sister&quot; sandwich, the Rachel, which is made with [[Cookbook:Pastrami|pastrami]] or [[Cookbook:Turkey|turkey]] in place of corned beef (and sometimes coleslaw in place of sauerkraut).
* A Georgia Reuben is a Rachel made with corned beef and coleslaw instead of sauerkraut. 
* A Reuben served in a Jewish delicatessen would not contain cheese, as dietary laws forbid meat and dairy in the same dish.

Green Sauce is a dish that originates from the Frankfurt/Main (Hesse, Germany) region.

== Ingredients (four servings) ==
* 3 to 4 cups (200g/7oz each) of sour cream
* milk
* 1 tbsp. sunflower oil (or other oil of neutral taste)
* 2 tsp. lemon juice
* 4 hard-boiled eggs
* 10 to 15 large potatoes
* one to one and a half empty sour cream cups filled with dill
* one to one and a half empty sour cream cups filled with other mixed herbs: chives, parsley, onion leaves, lemon balm, burnet, a small amount of sorrel if available

''(the amounts of herbs could need more precise measurements; this is all I have)''

== Preparation ==
Mix sour cream, oil and lemon juice and add milk until the mixture takes the consistency of a thick sauce. Chop herbs to very fine bits and mix them into the sauce. Cut hard-boiled eggs to small pieces and add them to the sauce along with some salt and pepper. Leave the sauce in the fridge for about one to one and a half hours.

Boil potatoes and serve hot with the cold sauce. More hard-boiled eggs can also be served along with this.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|Cuisine of France]] | [[Cookbook:Soup|Soup]]

There are few things more versatile or more satisfying than '''Potage Parmentier''' (Leek and Potato Soup) or one of its myriad variations. It’s good freshly-made and better the next day. Hot or cold, it makes a lovely start to dinner; served with some left-over meat, a great lunch. It's a great mid-afternoon pick-me-up, either straight out of the 'fridge or zapped in the microwave. 

As delicious as is basic leek-and-potato soup, we often include other vegetables or herbs: broccoli stems, asparagus stalks, a large handful of parsley or cress (pretty much whatever’s in the crisper): the variations are endless. This is one of the classic ways the French utilize left-over or less-than-perfect vegetables bought cheap from the market - a principle of both taste and economy that all would do well to adopt. 

You shouldn't be a stickler about using leeks, either: while they have a more subtle flavor than onions, they can be expensive and/or difficult to source out of season. Feel free to use regular onions (the milder yellow/Spanish varieties are best) or use a couple of bunches of scallions (spring onions).
 
The only rub comes when it’s time to puree the soup. While it can be pureed in a blender, it’s much better to use a food mill. Blenders tend to make the potato starches glue-like and pulverize the woody parts of the other vegetables. The food mill doesn’t change the texture of the potato starch and strains out the vegetable pulp. It takes a little extra muscle, but it’s well worth the effort. Using the chopping blade in a food processor (Cuisinart) will also puree the soup without the potato separating provided the action is pulsed and not overdone, however the mixture should be sieved if woody-cored root vegetables such as turnips or parsnips are used

This recipe makes two quarts of soup, though it's worthwhile to double or triple it; left-overs easily last 7-10 days in the refrigerator, though you’ll probably eat them long before that time. 

== Ingredients ==
* 3 - 4 cups sliced leeks or onions (about 1 lb. or 450g)
* 3 - 4 cups (700-900g/2lb) floury potatoes (eg. Idaho, Maris Piper), peeled and thickly sliced
* 2 quarts water (a proportion of light chicken or vegetable stock made be used)
* 2 tbs. kosher or 1 tb. sea/rock salt
* White pepper (ground) to taste
* 4 - 6 Tbs. heavy (double) cream
* 1 - 2 cups (up to 450g/1lb) vegetables (optional)
* 1 - 2 handsful flat-leaf parsley or watercress (optional)

== Preparation ==
# Peel and thinly slice the ptatoes and onions. If using leeks, remove the roots and dark green leaves; wash twice as long as you think necessary to remove the grit. Thinly slice any optional vegetables or roughly chop any optional herbs.
# Place the vegetables, water and salt in a pot and bring to a boil; Lower the heat and gently simmer (partially covered) for 45—50 minutes. The soup is done when you can easily mash the vegetables against the side of the pot.
# Puree the soup using a food mill fitted with the fine disc. Optionally, “pulse” it in a blender until just smooth and pass through a fine sieve.
# Chill the soup if it is to be served cold  or gently reheat it to a simmer. Refrigerate any left-overs. It will keep for days if refrigerated in a covered container as soon as it cools.
# Add 1½—2 tsp. cream (or whole milk) per portion just before serving. You’ll need more cream if you’re serving the soup hot or if it’s a bit watery; the idea is to create a smooth, silky puree, but you don’t want the taste or mouth feel of the cream to predominate. Taste and adjust for salt and pepper.
# Snipped chives are the classic garniture for leek-and-potato soup. When we include asparagus, we use steamed asparagus tips as a garnish; with broccoli, use steamed broccoli flowerets—you get the idea. Of course, if you’re just pouring a mid-afternoon mug for yourself, who cares how it looks?

== Notes ==
* Raw vegetables should be added to the soup at the beginning of the cooking time; if using left-over vegetables or herbs, add them after the soup has been cooking for 30—40 minutes, so they cook just long enough to completely warm through.
* If using &quot;regular&quot; table salt instead of kosher salt, reduce the amount of salt to 1½ tbs. A chilled soup may require slightly more seasoning which can be added individually to taste.     
* A combination of young buttery parsnips and mustard-and-cress makes the classic French ''Puree Pasternak''. Potato starch or cornstarch can be used to stabilise the puree which should be milled or sieved.

It has been said that it's hard to mess up a good steak, but cooking a &quot;good&quot; steak entirely depends on preparation and choice of meat.  There are many good cuts of beef for steak, but the best of them will have been dry-aged for some amount of time, and will be well-marbled with fat.  Also, a good cut of meat will always taste its best when cooked such that the meat is still pink, even bordering on red (rare or medium-rare).  It has also been said that, if a person is prone to order his steak well-done, then he should simply stop ordering steak, as it is clear that he does not enjoy it.

Here are a few recipes for preparing a good ol' fashioned grilled steak.

==Grilled/oven-broiled Steak Recipe==

===Ingredients===

* a choice or prime cut of beef (rib-eye and New York strip are always good choices)
* rock salt or coarse sea salt
* peppercorns
* olive oil

===Method===

Rinse the meat with cold water and dry it with a paper towel.  Coat it very lightly with olive oil.  Grind the salt and peppercorns into a small bowl (use your judgement as to how much to use), mix them together, and rub this onto the meat, coating both sides.  The more salt and pepper you use, the more crust you'll get once it's done, but you may also cover up the natural flavor of the beef.

Heat a cast-iron skillet or grill pan (a non-stick one will work also, but a cast-iron one holds temperature better) on a stove for three to five minutes on high heat, until it is evenly heated.  You can add more oil to the pan if you like, but this isn't necessary.  While you're doing this, pre-heat your oven to as high a temperature as your pan will take.  (For example, the average plastic-handled aluminum non-stick grill pan will only survive up to around 300 degrees F [160c], but a cast iron pan can go higher.)

Put the steak onto the pan, and let it cook for about two to three minutes.  There will be a lot of smoke; if you have an over-the-range exhaust vent, turn it on max.  Maybe open a window or two as well.

After about two or three minutes, flip the meat over, and cook for another two to three minutes.

After that's done, put the entire works (pan plus meat) into the oven, and let it sit for another two to four minutes.  (Note that all these times are approximate, and will depend heavily on how well you want your steak cooked, as well as the temperature the pan can withstand, and the thickness and quality of the meat.  It'll take a little practice to get right, but you can cheat a little by using an instant-read thermometer.  130 degrees F [50c] is medium-rare.)

Remove the steak promptly from the oven, put it on a plate, and let it sit for one or two minutes so that the juices inside the steak can re-distribute through the meat.  Add red wine, some rice or potatoes, and enjoy.</text>

'''Dinuguan''' (Pork Blood Stew) or '''Dinardaraan''' in Ilocano is a [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the Philippines|Filipino]] dish usually made from the blood, entrails and meat of a pig. It is sometimes known as &quot;[[Cookbook:chocolate|chocolate]] meat&quot; as the stew has a thick chocolate-like color and consistency. The name &quot;dinuguan&quot; is derived from the Filipino word &quot;dugo&quot;, meaning blood. Likewise, in Ilocano, &quot;dinardaraan&quot; is derived from the from &quot;dara&quot;, meaning blood. Dinuguan has more liquid, while dinardaraan is drier.

==Ingredients==
*3 [[Cookbook:cup|cup]]s (700g) cubed boneless [[Cookbook:pork|pork]] butt with fat (&amp;frac12;-inch cubes) 
*3 [[Cookbook:tablespoon|tablespoon]]s [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]] or [[Cookbook:Peanut Oil|peanut oil]] 
*½ cup (120ml) [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]] mixed with 1 cup (240ml) [[Cookbook:Water|water]] and 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

*1½ cups (360ml) [[Cookbook:pork blood|pork blood]] (Ideally from [[Cookbook:cuisine of Vietnam|Vietnam]]ese, Filipino or Western European markets) 
*3 cloves [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic]], peeled and crushed 
*2 hot [[Cookbook:Jalapeño|jalapeño peppers]], seeded and chopped 

== Procedure ==
#Place the pork in a 4-quart (560ml) covered stove-top [[Cookbook:Casserole|casserole dish]] and add the vinegar mixture. Bring to a [[Cookbook:Boil|boil]] and reduce the heat. 
#Cook, covered, for about an hour, until the pork is tender. Make sure that the liquid doesn't dry out. Add more water if necessary. 
# Heat a [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]] and add the lard or oil. 
# When the oil is hot enough, [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sauté]] the onion and garlic until the onion appears translucent. Remove from heat. 
#Add the oil, garlic, and onion to the pork and continue cooking for 5 minutes.
#[[Cookbook:Purée|Purée]] the pork blood in a [[Cookbook:Food Processor|food processor]]. 
#Add the blood to the pork gradually while stirring the mixture. Bring to a boil. 
#Add the chopped pepper and [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]] uncovered to reduce the sauce until desired thickness is achieved. Keep covered and serve hot. 

This is most often served over [[Cookbook:rice|rice]] or [[Cookbook:puto|puto]] (sweet steamed rice [[Cookbook:muffin|muffin]]s).

__TOC__

Caramel is a form of sugar that is used in candies, baked goods, desserts, dips, sauces and other prepared food products.

=== The Science of Caramel ===
Essentially, caramel is melted sugar.  As sugar increases in temperature, it reacts in a process similar to burning that results in the creation of a wide variety of complex molecules.  These molecules provide the deep, rich flavors and colors that make caramel so special.

There are two basic ways to make caramel:  the dry method and the wet method.  The dry method, which involves slowly heating sugar until it melts, is more difficult.  The more commonly used wet method is easier and does not require any special tools.

In the wet method, granulated sugar is dissolved in water, then boiled until the water starts to evaporate.  As the water escapes, the solution passes through a series of stages that indicates the ratio of water and sugar.  This ratio is directly proportionate to the temperature so if you understand the stages, you do not need a candy thermometer.  Nevertheless, use of a thermometer minimizes the handling of the (very) hot mixture.

The stages of a sugar solution are generally described by the solution's behavior when dropped into cold water:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thread Stage (230°F) - the solution thickens into syrupy threads when you pull a spoon out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soft Ball Stage (234°F) - the solution can be pressed into a soft gooey ball.  Used to make soft chewy candies like taffy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hard Ball Stage (250°F) - the solution can be pressed into a dense, slightly malleable ball.  Used to make harder chewy candies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soft Crack Stage (270°F) - the solution solidifies into a glass-like solid that slowly bends  under light pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hard Crack Stage (300°F) - the solution solidifies into a hard glass-like solid that breaks or cracks under pressure.  Used to make hard candies and brittles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Caramel Stage''' (310°F) - An advanced crack stage, defined by the development of an amber color that becomes tan, brown and eventually dark brown as the temperature continues to rise.  Also defined by the development of caramel flavors which becomes deeper, less sweet and more bitter as it darkens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Burned Stage (350°F) - The sugar is completely oxidized (burned) and turns black.  It is inedible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

As the water evaporates, the solution becomes super-saturated (contains more dissolved solid than can normally be held by water).  As a result, the sugar will want to re-crystalize.  Once the sugar is dissolved, do not disturb or contaminate the pot or it may spontaneously crystallize into crunchy &quot;candy&quot; (yech) and you will have to start over.  Adding a little corn syrup can help prevent crystallization because it is a different type of sugar.

Caramelized sugar by itself solidifies to a glass-like consistency.  For a more usable consistency liquid and fat are added.  The ingredients listed in the recipes below result in thick but workable products that soften significantly when warmed.  By using less liquid and fat, you can increase the thickness so that the caramel can be used for dipping apples, making chewy candy, nut brittles, or even art.

== Caramel Sauce ==

The softer caramel products, such as this recipe for caramel sauce, contain fat and liquid in addition to the caramelized sugar.  To create the texture of caramel sauce, you need a 1:1 ratio of fat and liquid.  In this recipe, heavy cream (40% fat) is used along with butter to achieve the 1:1 fat:liquid ratio.  If you want to substitute milk you will need to use less milk and more butter to keep the ratio.  You can also substitute soy-milk and margarine to make a vegan caramel sauce, but make sure to keep the fat:liquid ratio.

This recipe makes approximately 6 cups of caramel sauce.  You can easily halve this recipe if you wish.  It takes 30-60 minutes depending how quickly you are evaporating the water.  If sealed in clean [[canning]] jars, the sauce can be stored for 3 months without refrigeration.  Or store refrigerated for up to 6 months.

&lt;b&gt;Ingredients&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 Cups Water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 Cups Sugar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 Tbsp Corn Syrup (optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pinch Salt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 Cups Heavy Whipping Cream&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/2 Cup (1 stick) Unsalted Butter, chopped into 1&quot; cubes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Safety&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding liquid to sugar that is over 300°F is dangerous!  Some of the liquid will immediately flash to super-hot steam.  To avoid steam burns, stay back from the pot and pour liquids at arms length.  Use an oven mitt for your hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you add your liquid to the hot sugar, it will boil violently.  To avoid messy and dangerous boil-overs, a 2.5 quart heavy bottomed sauce pan or pot is the minimum, but 3-4 quarts is recommended&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a heat proof spatula or spoon such as wood or silicone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Directions&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Dissolve the water, sugar and corn syrup over medium high heat until fully dissolved.
[[Image:Caramel_sugar_water_th.jpg|none]] 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Stop stirring&lt;/u&gt; and let the solution boil over medium heat.  Check on the solution every 5 minutes.  You will see the bubbles slow down and get larger.  When the bubbles begin to reach 1/2&quot; to 3/4&quot; start monitoring the solution frequently.

&lt;br&gt;When the solution begins to turn amber, get your cream and butter and watch it constantly.
[[Image:Caramel_crack_stage_th.jpg|none]] 
&lt;br&gt;When the solution has turned a shade of caramel that you like (darker is deeper and will start to take on a little bitterness), step back and add the cream at arms length, stirring constantly and scraping the sides of the pan.

&lt;br&gt;Add the butter and stir until incorporated.  Pour the sauce into a serving dish for immediate serving with bread, drizzled on ice cream, as a garnish or for use in other desserts.
[[Image:Caramel_Added_butter2_th.jpg|none]] 
&lt;br&gt;If you desire, follow standard canning procedures and distribute into canning jars.  Allow to cool until the buttons are depressed.  Any jars with buttons that are not depressed should be refrigerated and consumed first.  To reheat the caramel sauce, microwave the jars (without covers) for 10-30 seconds depending how soft and hot you want it.

=== Other Caramel Options ===
The following are all variations that can be made at different stages of the recipe above.

&lt;b&gt;Simple Syrup&lt;/b&gt;
The first step in the recipe was to dissolve two parts sugar in one part water.  This creates a simple syrup, perfect for sweetening cold drinks (e.g. Iced Tea) without having to wait for granulated sugar to dissolve.

&lt;b&gt;Caramel Chews&lt;/b&gt;
Replace the cream with 3/4 Cup Half &amp; Half.  Pour the hot mixture onto a silicone mat or parchment paper to cool.  When it is cool enough to handle, fold and knead the caramel a few times, then break into bite size pieces.  Allow to cool completely before wrapping individually.

&lt;b&gt;Turtles&lt;/b&gt;
Replace the cream with 3/4 Cup Half &amp; Half.  Pour the hot mixture over 4 cups of your favorite nut on a silicone mat or parchment paper to cool.  When it is cool enough to handle, fold and knead the caramel until the nuts are fully distributed, then break into bite size pieces.  Melt chocolate over a double boiler or in the microwave and dip the turtles or simply drizzle chocolate on top.

&lt;b&gt;Toffee&lt;/b&gt;
Instead of cream, use 7 sticks of butter (a total of 8 sticks or 4 cups, so you have equal parts butter and sugar).  Mix in chopped nuts if desired.  Pour onto a silicone mat or parchment paper or molds.  After cool drizzle or dip with chocolate and chopped nuts.

&lt;b&gt;Nut Brittle&lt;/b&gt;
Do not use any cream or butter.  Stir in 1/2 tsp. baking soda (optional), then pour the molten caramel over 4 cups of your favorite nuts on a silicone mat or parchment paper and let it cool.  When it has reached room temperature, break it up with a mallet or by dropping the sheet on the counter.  Wrap and store in an air-tight container.

&lt;b&gt;Sugar Art&lt;/b&gt;
You can do this at any point during the hard crack or caramel stages.  Remove the sugar from the heat and allow to cool for one minute.  Using a spoon, let the syrup drip off.  If it drips in globs, let it cool longer.  If it drips in a continuous stream, you can start making art.  Drizzle the syrup in patterns over a silicone mat or parchment paper and allow to cool, then carefully peel off.  Or, spray bowls and other (clean) objects with cooking spray and drizzle the syrup to create domes and other shapes.  Allow to cool to room temperature, then serve soon or store in an air tight container.  These will eventually soften and droop from humidity in the air.

== PURE fudge &amp;copy; Caramel ==

Here is the recipe we use at PURE fudge&amp;copy; for our caramel.  We have experimented for a while now, and this one seems to work best in even the most humid weather.  Caramel is hard to make, it takes patience and practice.

Caramel likes fat, so use real butter, and use cream if you can afford it.  Milk is a good substitute but you have to use WHOLE milk, not skim or 2%. 

The other thing to remember is that you are CARMELIZING the sugar, so you need a hot temperature once you get going.  Caramel will &quot;spit&quot; as it boils so wear long sleeves and use a long spoon to stir with. NEVER cook caramel naked... just a bad idea.

Temperature is a funny thing with caramel.  If you want a caramel sauce, cook it to about 230.  If you want a hard candy, cook it to about 255 - 260.  This recipe is for making our Artisan Caramel Apples, so it gets cooked to 248 exactly in the PURE fudge kitchens.  

When cool it is very firm but chewy, when it cools to about 180 degrees it is perfect for dipping.

=== Equipment ===
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Candy Thermometer
&lt;LI&gt;LARGE saucepan or pot
&lt;LI&gt;Long handled wooden spoon
&lt;LI&gt;High Temperature Spatula (to get all the caramel out of the pot)
&lt;/UL&gt;

=== Ingredients ===
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;1 stick of butter (1/4 pound - 110g)
&lt;LI&gt;2 cups (480g) of Pure Cane Sugar (always use Pure Cane Sugar)
&lt;LI&gt;1 1/2 cups (360ml) Heavy Cream OR Whole Milk (not skim or 2%)
&lt;LI&gt;1 Cup (240ml) Light Corn Syrup
&lt;LI&gt;1 - 2 teaspoons Vanilla
&lt;/UL&gt;


=== Directions ===
Use a large saucepan or pot,the liquid will boil up to about 3 times the amount of warm liquid, so use a large cooking vessel.

NEVER cover the pot with a lid. the moisture will turn it into taffy or destroy it.

All temperatures are Fahrenheit.

On a low heat

&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Melt the butter&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;pour in the cream or milk&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;/UL&gt;
If you are using milk, heat on '''LOW''' for about 20 minutes so all the fats mix together, stiring occasionally.  Remember, better too low heat at this stage than too high.  If you scorch the milk or cream, you have to start over.

If you are using cream, you can just go right to the next step.

Next add

&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Corn Syrup&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;/UL&gt;

Let this cook into the mix for about 5 minutes, stir about once a minute for 15 seconds.

Then add
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Sugar&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;/UL&gt;
Stir this in until completely dissolved.  Turn the heat up to medium at this point and continue to stir for about 5 minutes until you are certain the sugar is completely dissolved.  It should look milky but feel smooth when you are stirring it.


Turn the heat up to just below high on a gas range.  Stir for 30 seconds, every 2 minutes.  When the tempature reached 248 degrees take the pot and place the bottom of it in cold water to stop the mixture from continuing to cook.

Keep stirring the entire time it is cooling.  When it starts to thicken a little add
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Vanilla&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;/UL&gt;

One teaspoon is fine, if you really like vanilla, you can add up to 2 teaspoons.  Remember, vanilla has a high alcohol content so don't add it when the mixture is really hot, or it will just all burn up and you wont get any of the flavor.

=== Finishing up ===
If you are making apples, you can go ahead and start dipping once the tempature reaches around 180.  Use clean refrigerated apples for a nice glaze.

I hope this works for you, I know it works for us and don't be afraid to play around with it a little either.  Just remember to keep the amounts of sugars and liquids and drys at about the same percentages.

Regards,

[http://www.PureFudge.com Patti at PURE fudge]

* 2oz / 60g [[Cookbook:Whole Wheat|whole-wheat flour]]
* 2oz / 60g [[Cookbook:Flour#Wheat Flour|plain white flour]]
* 2 oz fine [[Cookbook:Semolina|semolina]]
* ¼ tsp. [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 tbs [[Cookbook:Vegetable Oil|vegetable oil]] for the dough

# Knead well for a few minutes. 
# Cover the dough and leave to rest for about half an hour.

===Frying Puri===
# Pour the oil for deep frying in a wok and heat the oil. 
# Meanwhile divide the dough into 8 small balls and roll into small circle. (about 3&quot; [7.5cm] in diameter) 
# You can use a bit of hot oil to roll the dough so it will not stick to the surface. 
# When the oil is hot (test - if you put a tiny dough in the oil it should come up straight away), lay the flatted dough over the oil, press the top slightly with the slotted spoon until it inflates itself, and turn to other side. Adjust the flame as necessary. 
# If it sinks quickly to the bottom of the wok, the oil is not hot enough (puri will absorb too much oil. ) It should balloon within a few seconds. 
# Remove from oil after the puri turn golden/light brown color and place on a wire rack or kitchen paper towel for excess oil to drain.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* For chapattis dough, don't use semolina and plain flour. Only use whole meal flour, salt and oil.

'''Papadum''' (also '''papadam''', '''poppadom''', '''papad''', and '''appalam''') is an [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan]] [[Cookbook:Flatbread|flatbread]].  Typically, it is prepared using [[Cookbook:Urad Bean|black gram]] bean flour, [[Cookbook:Rice Flour|rice flour]], or [[Cookbook:Lentil|lentil]] flour with [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Peanut Oil|peanut oil]] added. The ingredients are made into a [[Cookbook:Dough|dough]] and formed into a thin, round shape similar to a [[Cookbook:Tortilla|tortilla]].  As the dough is prepared, the papadum can be seasoned with a variety of different ingredients such as [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chilies]], [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]], [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]], or other [[Cookbook:Spices and herbs|spices]].

Papadums are cooked by deep-frying in oil, which causes them to expand and crispen. They may also be cooked by roasting them over an open flame, in a [[Cookbook:Toaster Oven|toaster oven]], or in a [[Cookbook:Microwave Oven|microwave oven]].   Depending on the cooking method they may be either soft and moist or crisp in texture.

Most often served as a complement to a main dish, they are also eaten as a [[Cookbook:Snacks|snack]] or as an [[Cookbook:Appetizers|appetizer]] to be topped with [[Cookbook:Chutney|chutney]], various dips or [[Cookbook:Salsa|salsas]]. Commonly made in different sizes, the smaller ones are for snacks and the larger variety may be used as a food wrap. 

== Ingredients==

*8 cups [[Cookbook:Urad Bean|black gram]] flour
*1 tsp cracked [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]
*1 tsp ground [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin seeds]]
*½ tsp [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*¼ cup [[Cookbook:Water|water]] (or more if needed)
*[[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] for frying

== Procedure ==

For 10 to 15 servings:

# Mix flour, pepper, cumin and salt.
# Add water and knead the dough until it is smooth. You may have to add some water, depending on the flour.
# Split the dough into 10 or 15 balls.
# Roll out one ball at a time to a very thin round layer on a slightly oiled surface.
# Dry the papadums in the oven for an hour (at about 100°C or 200°F).
# Right now you can keep them in an airtight container or something.
# Fry the papadums in oil until they are crispy (not too brown!).

[[Image:Tortilla_patatas.jpg|right|thumb|A portion of tortilla]]
'''Tortilla de patatas''' (potato [[Cookbook:Omelette|omelette]]) is also sometimes called ''tortilla española'' (Spanish omelette) to differentiate it from the dish commonly known as ''tortilla francesa'' (French omelette) or just ''[[Cookbook:Tortilla|tortilla]]'', which is made only with eggs (or actually maize/corn, in the case of the Mexican tortilla). It is a very popular dish at any kind of event in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Spain|Spain]] and can be served either cold or hot. It is also served as a ''[[Cookbook:Tapas|tapas]]'' dish. Although potatoes and eggs are the basic and in most cases the only ingredients of a ''tortilla de patatas'', other vegetables can also be found accompanying it such as onions and, more rarely, red peppers, chives, artichokes, ham or even chorizo, and then it is called ''tortilla paisana''.

==Ingredients==

*3 lb /1200 g [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]]es
*4 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
*2 cups [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]] 
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

== Procedure ==

[[Image:Frying_potatoes.jpg|right|thumb|Frying the potato slices.]] 

Peel the potatoes and cut them into small cubes or thin round slices. Sprinkle with salt and leave any excess water to drain from them while heating the oil to around 350°F (177°C) in a large frying pan. Fry the potato chips until they are very slightly golden, although this is a matter of taste: the more golden and crisp the potatoes are, the more juicy will be the omelette. For a dryer and thicker ''tortilla'', turn the heat down and let the potatoes cook gently until tender and soft. 

Remove the potatoes from the oil and drain. Beat the eggs, add salt to taste and mix with the potato chips. Leave them to soak for 10 minutes.

Next, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a frying pan and, when it's smoking hot, add the potato and egg mixture. Use a smaller frying pan so you will get a thicker and well rounded omelette. Shake the pan to avoid the omelette sticking or burning. After a few minutes, turn the omelette over with the help of a flat lid or a large dish, and leave until golden on the other side. 
Serve hot or cold accompanied by a salad.

'''Rugelach''' is a Jewish pastry dish with raisins, walnuts, and sometimes chocolate.

== Ingredients ==
*2 cups [[Cookbook:flour|all-purpose flour]]
*1/2 cup plus 4 teaspoons [[Cookbook:sugar|sugar]]
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*1/2 teaspoon [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
*1 cup loosely packed golden [[Cookbook:raisin|raisin]]s, chopped
*1 1/4 cups [[Cookbook:walnut|walnut]]s (1/4 lb), finely chopped
*16 tablespoons (2 sticks) unsalted [[Cookbook:butter|butter]], softened
*8 oz. [[Cookbook:cream cheese|cream cheese]], softened
*1 cup apricot [[Cookbook:jam|jam]] or raspberry jam
*[[Cookbook:Milk|Milk]] to brush Rugelach

== Instructions ==
#Whisk flour and salt in a medium bowl.
#Beat butter and cream cheese in a large bowl with a mixer until well combined.
#Stir in flour until the contents is the consistency of dough.
#Roll the dough into a ball and wrap in plastic; flatten into a 5x7 inch rectangle.
#Refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours.
#Line a large shallow baking pan with parchment paper. Preheat oven to 350F. 
#Cut the chilled dough into 4 even pieces, and return all but 1 to the fridge in plastic wrap. Roll the remaining piece into a 12x8 inch rectangle on a floured surface with a floured rolling pin (to prevent sticking).
#Put the flattened dough on parchment paper, and then return to the fridge to chill while you repeat the flattening process on all other dough quarters.
#After you are done flattening the dough, return the last piece to the fridge.
#Whisk the 1/2 cup sugar with cinnamon in a medium bowl.
#Take one dough quarter out of the fridge and spread 1/4 cup of the jam over the dough with a spatula. Over the dough, scatter 1/4 cup of raisins and then walnuts, finally 2 tablespoons of the whisked cinnamon sugar.
#Roll the dough quarter up into a tight cylinder. Place the dough cylinder seam-side down in the baking pan and close and tuck the ends.
#Repeat the same process with the other 3 dough rectangles.
#Finish the cylinders by brushing with milk, sprinkle each with a teaspoon of sugar. Using a large knife, score the dough cylinders with 3/4 inch deep cuts, at one inch intervals.
#Bake at 350F for 45-50 minutes.
#Take out of the oven, cool in the pan on a wire rack for 30 minutes. Transfer cylinders to a cutting board and cut slices from the cylinders to make rugelach.

==Notes, Tips, and Variations==
*Instead of using raisins, try substituting mini [[Cookbook:chocolate chips|chocolate chips]].

==Ingredients==

* Redgram ([[Cookbook:Toor Dal|Toor Dal]]) - ½ cup
* [[Cookbook:Water|Water]] - 2 cups
* 2 handfuls of [[Cookbook:Fenugreek|Methi leaves]] (Only the leaves without the tender stem)
* 3 [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
* 1 big [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* Pinch of [[Cookbook:Turmeric|Turmeric powder]]
* One/Two [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|green chilli]], sliced
* 10 whole [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]].
* One small dollop of [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* Small piece of [[Cookbook:Ginger|Ginger]] (if you like Ginger)

==Procedure==
Mix all above and put them in an Indian cooker ([[Cookbook:Pressure Cooking|pressure cooker]]).  Wait until the dal is cooked ( 4 whistles ).

Heat two spoons of [[Cookbook:Ghee|Ghee]], and fry

* half small spoon of [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard seeds]]
* half small spoon of [[Cookbook:Cumin|Zheera]] (cumin)
* two sliced [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic cloves]]
* two [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|red chillis]]
* 6 to 8 [[Cookbook:Curry Leaf|curry leaves]]

This takes less than 30 seconds to fry. Once garlic turns golden, add one small tomato finely chopped. Add salt, chilli powder to your taste.  Add  &quot;Coriander or Dhaniya powder&quot;. I would recommend this.  Add the above cooked Dal Mix to this fry, and  let it simmer. You can add water if you like it to be gravyish. Add two drops of [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]] for added taste.

Eat this with hot rice,  and an optional touch of Gongura pickle.

Serves 6-8.

==Ingredients==
*9[[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] (250g) gingernut (or [[Cookbook:Digestive Biscuit|digestive]]) biscuits
*10[[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] (275g) [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] 
*1 tin (400g) [[Cookbook:Sweetened Condensed Milk|sweetened condensed milk]]
*6[[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] (175g) [[Cookbook:Caster Sugar|caster sugar]]
*1/4 pint (150[[Cookbook:mL|ml]]) [[Cookbook:Double Cream|double cream]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Banana|bananas]]

==Procedure==
To make the base, crush the biscuits into crumbs with the end of a [[Cookbook:Rolling Pin|rolling pin]] -- this is best done inside a freezer bag to avoid spillage and loss. Melt two-fifths of the butter (about 4oz) in a large saucepan. Once melted, take off the heat add mix in the biscuit crumbs. Press into the bottom of an 8-inch (20cm) loose-bottomed tin, and transfer to a fridge to chill.

For the filling, place the remaining butter with the sugar into a medium-sized saucepan (ideally non-stick if you don't like dish washing) and melt over a medium heat, stirring until the butter has melted, and sugar is just starting to melt. Add the condensed milk and bring to the boil, stirring continuously for 5 minutes to make your caramel.

To assemble, chop the bananas into slices, arrange over the base, and pour the caramel over the top, before returning to chill for at least an hour for the caramel to firm.

Prior to serving, whip the cream, and spoon over the top, optionally with some grated chocolate, or garnish with [[Cookbook:Cape Gooseberry|Cape gooseberries]].

==Warnings==
*One pie may not be enough...
*If there are children present, it is practically impossible to keep them from licking the contents of the condensed milk tin! Be careful of the edges.

== Morel Mushroom Sauce ==

Sautee in a few tablespoons hot butter 'til done: 4 each of: Boneless chicken breasts, butterflied or Walleye filets, Pheasant breast or Veal cutlets, pounded thin.

Keep warm and ladle sauce over, using heated plates-BON APPETIT!!!

Preparation 
In a 12&quot; non-stick skillet, heat 3 Tbs. butter (no substitute) over med.-high heat until foaming. Add 3 Cups small gray morels, or larger morels cut into slices no more than 1&quot; long. Sautee, stirring occassionally, for 15-20 min. until slightly crispy. Add 1/4 C. thinly sliced green onion tops, 1/2 Tbs. dried parsley, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, 1/4 tsp. pepper, 1 tsp. Lawrey's salt, and cook for a few min. Turn heat to higher and add 1/2 C. dry white wine and reduce to almost a glaze. Turn heat to med. and add 2 C. whipping cream and 1/2 tsp. Dijon mustard. Reduce slightly over slow boil until thickened- about 10-12 min. Serve.

Recipe for 4 persons. To make these really grand dishes, add 20-24 nice-sized boiled shrimp to sauce before serving.

== A Grandmother's Morel Recipe ... ==

1 Batch of Morels, halved, cleaned &amp; soaked &quot;a while&quot; or overnight in salt water with a heavy plate weighing them down in the water, then rinsed well &amp; drained at cooking time.
In a wide shallow bowl: 1 Country Egg mixed with 1/4 c. milk
In a thick paper bag: 2 c. cornmeal with 1 t. black pepper mixed in.
In a deep well-seasoned cast-iron skillet, melt bacon grease 1&quot; deep. Get it good and hot but not smoking.
Now dip your mushrooms in the milk and let them soak a little while your grease is heating.
Pick a handful out of the bowl and shake them a little to get off some of the liquid excess then drop them in the bag of cornmeal.
Hold your hand on the bottom of the bag so  it doesn't break, and gently shake.
Add more mushrooms, shaking gently after each addition. When they are all coated very well, start laying them in a single layer in the hot skillet.
Try to only turn them once, that way your coating stays on better.
Don't salt, bacon grease is salty. When golden, drain on paper. 

Being lazy, I gently dump the coated morels in a colander set in a larger bowl. This lets the loose stuff fall off and if you need to touch up any bare spots your coating is right there.

My husband's family uses cracker crumbs and they made a production line out of it for extra family fun. It truly doesn't get any better than this, and if there aren't Morels in Heaven, I'm not sure I want to go there!

==Ingredients==

* 1 lb (500g) [[Cookbook:Lima Bean|pallares]] (large lima beans)
* [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* 2-3 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Vinegar|white vinegar]]
* 1 spoonful [[Cookbook:Dijon Mustard|Dijon mustard]]
* [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Onion|red onion]], finely diced
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
* a few sprigs of [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]]

==Procedure==

# Soak one pound of pallares (large lima beans) overnight or at least 6 hours. Change water two or three times.
# Boil the beans (without salt) with enough water to cover them. Use high heat until water reaches boiling point. Skim and reduce your fire. Simmer for about 1 hour. No exact timing is possible, since cooking time depends on the dryness of the beans. 
# When the beans are plump and tender, take them off the heat and drain. You might reserve the boiling liquid to process leftovers into a soup.
# Season the beans lightly with salt (kosher works great) and, while the beans cool down, prepare your vinaigrette.
# Mix one cup of olive oil, two or three spoonfuls of white vinegar, one spoonful of Dijon mustard, salt and pepper to taste, one finely diced small red onion, and two diced seeded tomatoes. 
# About half to one hour later, once the beans are at room temperature, check the seasoning of the vinaigrette. It should taste a bit stronger than expected. 
# Carefully mix the vinaigrette with the beans. Finely cut a few sprigs of parsley and mix again. 
# Reserve some more parsley for decoration, and voila!

'''Pikelets''' are small, thick [[Cookbook:Pancake|pancakes]], and are standards of the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of New Zealand|New Zealand]] kitchen. They are also made in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Australia|Australia]].

==Ingredients==

* 125g [[Cookbook:Flour|strong bread flour]]
* 125g [[Cookbook:Flour|plain flour]]
* 1½ teaspoons [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|bicarbonate of soda]]
* 8g [[Cookbook:Yeast|fresh yeast]]
* 75ml [[Cookbook:Lukewarm|lukewarm]] [[Cookbook:Milk|whole milk]]
* ½ teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 250ml lukewarm [[Cookbook:Water|water]]

==Procedure==

# Sift the flours into a large mixing bowl adding half a teaspoon of the bicarbonate of soda and the salt.
# Crumble the yeast into a small bowl and slowly add the water until you have a brown paste.
# Pour the liquid yeast into the mixing bowl.
# Mix it about a bit until you have a very thick batter. You can use a wooden spoon, but you get much better results if you get stuck in and use your hands.
#Cover the bowl with a warm and damp cloth and leave in a warm place for two hours. I like to bake this after I have had my dinner so I usually put it into the oven. If you do the same make sure the oven is not too hot before you do this as not only will the mixture start cooking, but you could melt a plastic mixing bowl.
# Return to the now frothy batter (if it is not then you have done something wrong). Dissolve the rest of the Bicarbonate of soda in the lukewarm milk and slowly add it to the batter.
# Heat either a lightly greased griddle or an ordinary frying pan and oil until it is very hot. Now with a spoonful at time cook the mixture for about two minuets on each side. The indication to turn should be when the bubbles that will form dry out.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Desserts|Desserts]]

A very simple recipe for plain churros. Makes one plateful, suitable for about 4 people. It can easily be doubled or halved, but be warned that attempting to mix more than double this recipe at once is very hard work.

==Ingredients==
* 400g [[Cookbook:Flour|plain flour]]
* 400ml boiling water
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Baking soda|bicarbonate of soda]] (baking soda)
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]

If you like, you can also add

* 1/4 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]

==Procedure==

#Sift the flour, bicarb (baking soda)and salt into a large mixing bowl.
#Add the boiling water gradually to the flour, mixing constantly until you get a very thick, smooth paste.
#Allow to stand for about an hour.
#Heat up a deep frying pan of oil until it shimmers.
#Using an icing bag, or a freezer bag with the corner cut out to give a hole about the size of your little finger, squeeze the paste into the pan. Use a pair of scissors to cut the sausage shaped pieces off after about 10cm.
#Fry these until golden brown and crunchy. If the pieces are too thick and are still raw in the middle, cut them in half lengthways and fry again.
#Serve dusted liberally with sugar or hot chocolate sauce (or both!).

Yorkshire pudding is a serving popular across the UK but originating in the county of Yorkshire in England.  It's traditionally eaten with beef or lamb with vegetables.

== Ingredients ==
* 1 cup (240g) unbleached white flour
* 1 cup (240g) whole wheat pastry flour
* 1 tsp. salt
* Ener-G egg replacer equivalent of 2 eggs
* 1 cup (240ml) soy milk
* 1 cup (240ml) very cold water
* 2 Tbsp. margarine, melted (note, use a margarine like Vitalite that contains no extracts of cow's milk)

== Procedure ==
# Preheat the oven to 425°F/210°C. 
# In a mixing bowl, combine the flours and salt. Make a well in the center and add the egg replacer mixture. Stir together until just combined, then add the soy milk and water, a bit at a time. Stir until smooth, but don’t overbeat. 
# Swirl the melted margarine around a shallow, 9x13-inch (22-32cm) baking pan. Pour out any excess and reserve. Pour the batter into the pan and pour any remaining margarine over the top. Bake for 20 minutes, or until golden on top and a knife inserted into the center comes out clean. Let cool, then cut into squares to serve. 

Makes 4 servings

==Ingredients==
;For the beef and broth
*3-4 lb. [[Cookbook:beef|beef]] roast
*2 cans beef [[Cookbook:Stock|stock]]
*2 cups [[Cookbook:water|water]]
*4 small beef [[Cookbook:Bouillon Cubes|bouillon cubes]]
*4 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaves]]
*some dried minced [[Cookbook:onion|onion]]
*some [[Cookbook:Worcestershire Sauce|Worcestershire sauce]]
*[[Cookbook:pepper|pepper]] and [[Cookbook:salt|salt]] to taste

;For the roux
*1 stick of [[Cookbook:butter|butter]]
*½ cup [[Cookbook:All-purpose flour|all purpose flour]]

;For the final assembly
*additional [[Cookbook:flour|flour]], for dredging
*2 [[Cookbook:egg|egg]]s
*[[Cookbook:Bread Crumb|Bread crumbs]], for dredging
*[[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|Vegetable oil]] or [[Cookbook:shortening|shortening]], for [[Cookbook:Deep Fat Frying|deep frying]]

==Procedure==
# Add the first set of ingredients to a [[Cookbook:slow cooker|slow cooker]]. Cook overnight on low, or until the meat starts to fall apart.
#This should yield about 1 quart (1 liter) of broth. Chill it in the fridge until the fat solidifies on the surface. Scoop off the fat.
#Use 2 forks to tear apart the meat. You can use a [[Cookbook:Food Processor|food processor]] if you don't want big chunks of meat in the final product.
#In a deep [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]], prepare a light brown [[Cookbook:roux|roux]] the butter and flour.
#While stirring the roux, slowly start adding the broth. It should accept all the broth to make a real thick sauce. 
#Season with salt &amp; pepper to taste. Pour it into a bowl or container and chill it for a couple of hours, or better, overnight.
#Prepare 3 stations, one deep plate with flour, one with 2 beaten eggs, one with plain bread crumbs. Start rolling the meat into small balls, about 1 1/2 in diameter. Roll each ball into flour, then egg, then plain breadcrumbs.
#[[Cookbook:Deep Fat Frying|Deep fry]] in 350 °F vegetable oil or shortening until golden brown.
#Serve hot with the sauce.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Instead of balls, you can roll &quot;cigars&quot;, about 4 inches long and about 1-1/4&quot; in diameter.
*Croquettes can be prepared ahead of time and frozen in a freezer zipper bag. When ready to continue, they may be added to the heated oil without being defrosted.

Melanzane alla Parmigiana is a typical southern Italian dish. There are some variations (including a dessert version with chocolate) but mostly the ingredients are: eggplants, tomato sauce, basil leaves, mozzarella, and, obviously, Parmesan cheese.

== Ingredients ==

* [[Cookbook:eggplant|eggplant]]
* [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Tomato Sauce|tomato sauce]]
* [[Cookbook:Basil|basil leaves]]
* [[Cookbook:Mozzarella Cheese|mozzarella cheese]]
* [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan]] (Parmigiano) cheese or alternatively Grana Padano cheese

== Procedure ==

Parmigiana is a dish that takes time and patience. You should start with good eggplants, possibly not too large, about 4 pounds (1900g) of them. Cut them lengthwise in slices ¼ of an inch (0.75cm) thick and put them in a plate covered by plenty of salt for about 1 hour. Wash the excess salt, and dry in paper towel. Fill a frying pan (cast iron if you have it) with ½ inch (1 cm) of olive oil and heat. When the oil is hot, start frying the eggplants slices a few at a time so they do not overlap in the pan. Cook until golden flipping once. Remove the eggplants and put them in a drainer so the excess oil can drain. Repeat until all the slices are cooked.  

Next prepare a tomato sauce.  Start cooking ½ medium onion in oil, when the onion is soft add 1 big can (24 oz [700g]) of drained whole tomatoes and mash them with a fork. If the tomatoes are watery you should add a small can of tomato paste to obtain sauce that is somewhat thick. Add a couple of leaves of basil and let cook for about 20 minutes. It is now time to assemble the Parmigiana, start with a bit of sauce in the bottom of a oven proof baking pan or a casserole. Then proceed with a layer of eggplants with their edges slightly overlapped and no voids, add basil leaves and sliced mozzarella. 

In Italy you would use ''fior di latte'' mozzarella which is a kind of fresh cheese made with cow milk. Add Parmesan and tomato sauce. Repeat until the eggplant is over and finish topping with tomato sauce and Parmesan. Bake in the oven for about 40 minutes at 350°F (180°C). Server really hot. If you are lucky enough to have leftovers, they taste even better the day after.

A '''blondie''' is essentially a brownie variant - a dense cake with butterscotch being the predominant flavor instead of chocolate. Characteristics to strive for include a rich, buttery flavor with good balance between sweetness and saltiness, moist texture, and a golden blonde appearance. This recipe should provide good foundation for further experimentation if you are so inclined.

== Ingredients ==
* 1 c. (140g) [[Cookbook:flour|flour]]
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* ¾ tsp [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
* ½ c. (120g) unsalted [[Cookbook:butter|butter]], melted 
* 1 c. (240g) dark [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]], firmly packed
* 1 tbsp [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla extract]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:egg|egg]]
* ¾ c. (180g) chopped [[Cookbook:pecan|pecan]]s

== Procedure ==
# Preheat oven to 325°F (170°C). 
# Dry toast the chopped pecans until fragrant and slightly colored. This can either be done in a dry skillet on the stove top over medium high heat while stirring frequently or else by roasting the nuts in the oven on a cookie sheet while you prepare the batter. The stove top method is faster but requires more attention. It is also possible to buy dry toasted nuts instead of raw to avoid this step. The pecans should be crunchy and nutty, not rubbery or mealy. 
# In a small bowl stir together the flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside.
# In a large bowl, stir the melted butter, brown sugar, and vanilla until uniform, breaking any large lumps of sugar. 
# Beat in egg until creamy. 
# Gently fold in flour mixture. When flour is nearly incorporated, gently fold in toasted pecans. Do not overmix.
# Spread mixture into buttered 8&quot;x8&quot; (20cm x 20cm)baking dish. 
# Bake @ 325°[[Cookbook:F|F]] (170°C) for 30 minutes or until desired doneness. 
# Let cool and cut into bars.

'''Fred Steak''' is a [[Cookbook:marinade|marinated]] [[Cookbook:beef|beef]] steak sold by Schaub's Meat, Fish and Poultry Market in the Stanford Shopping Center in Palo Alto, [[Cookbook:California cuisine|California]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|United States]]. Its primary characteristic is its very black color - it looks burnt, even when raw. The dark covering forms a crust during a cooking.

[[Image:Fred Steak.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Fred Steak]]

Fred is a staple of SF Bay Area BBQs, especially summer weekends.

== Marinade Recipe ==

The marinade is a secret, though some imitations have been listed on the Internet, including the [http://www.cyclingforums.com/showthread.php?t=66075 Following Knock-Off]:

===Ingredients===
*1-1/2 cup brewed [[Cookbook:coffee|coffee]] 
*1 cup [[Cookbook:red wine|red wine]]
*1/2 cup [[Cookbook:olive oil|olive oil]]
*1/2 cup [[Cookbook:molasses|molasses]]
*1/3 cup [[Cookbook:Balsamic vinegar|Balsamic vinegar]]
*1/3 cup [[Cookbook:Tamari sauce|Tamari sauce]]
*1/3 cup [[Cookbook:Worcestershire sauce|Worcestershire sauce]]
*2 Tbsp [[Cookbook:chili powder|chili powder]]
*6 cloves [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic]]

== History ==

It was originally called &quot;Marinated Sirloin&quot; in the 1950s or 1960s by Fred Schaub at his Los Gatos, CA meat market. That market closed in 1979, though the 2006 Schaub's brochure claims Fred's son David would be stopped on the street by ex-customers and asked where they could purchase &quot;Fred's Steaks.&quot; When David Schaub opened the current market in the Stanford Shopping Center in 1988, he again offered the product. Fred Schaub died in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Schaub's Meat Market Brochure&lt;/ref&gt;

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Pasta Recipes|Pasta Recipes]]

==Ingredients==
*2 whole [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
*1/8 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1/2 cup (120ml) [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]]
*1 Tablespoon of [[Cookbook:Olive oil|olive oil]]
*3 cups (700g) [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]

==Procedure==

#In a bowl beat together eggs, salt, olive oil, and wine.
#Stir in 1 cup flour with fork.
#Gently add 2nd cup of flour after 1st is mixed thoroughly.
#Remove mixture from bowl and place on a lightly floured work surface.
#Knead in the last cup of flour a bit at a time.  If the dough becomes too dry, add a bit of cold [[Cookbook:Water|water]].
#Continue kneading until the dough is uniform and satinny in appearance.
#Roll into a large ball and cut into quarters.  Overturn the mixing bowl over the cut pieces to protect from dust.
#Let dough relax for approx. 30 minutes.

==Notes, tips, and variations==

This dough can be rolled and used for Lasagne, cut and used for Fettucinni, or rolled out for Ravioli.  One quarter cut into fettucinni will feed four.  Store any remaining dough lightly floured in a bag in the refrigerator for up to two weeks, or dried and stored in a cool dry place for up to a month.

'''When Kneading:''' It may get tough to knead the flour into the dough when you are down to the last 1/4 cup (60g).  Be careful not to add too much water to the dough after you have begun kneading.  lightly dipping your fingers into the water and coating the outside of the dough should be enough.  Kneading is hard work and it takes the better part of 20 minutes for proper consistancy.

'''To Cook:''' Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil.  Add rolled and cut noodles to the water and cook to al dente.

*Non-Alcoholic Variation - 1/2 cup (120ml) of [[Cookbook:Water|water]] can be used in place of the [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]]
*Egg Noodles - 3 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]] can be substituted for 1/2 cup (120ml) of white wine to make egg noodles.

#Put oil into a wide [[Cookbook:Pot|pot]] and heat it..
#In several batches, brown the beef in the pot with the oil.
#Into the pot: all beef, all spices, tomato juice, and the double-strength beef broth (w/o water).
#Cover the pot, then [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]] for at least an hour to soften the beef. Stir the stew every few minutes to prevent the beef from burning on the bottom of the pot.
#Peel the carrots, cut them into pieces about the same size as the beef, add them to the stew, and simmer a bit more. (stirring every few minutes) 
#Cut the other vegetables likewise, and simmer a bit more. (stirring every few minutes)
#When all the vegetables are soft but not yet falling apart, remove the bay leaf and serve the stew.

==Variation==
Add other vegetables such as [[Cookbook:Turnip|turnips]], [[Cookbook:Parsnip|parsnips]], and frozen [[Cookbook:Corn|corn]]. Note that turnips mush quickly.

This is Thai-style fried fried rice with chicken, as street vendors in the central region of Thailand fix it. Note that this is a very imprecise recipe, and so &quot;cups&quot; means &quot;handfuls&quot;. Any measuring tool that holds about the capacity of a large handful will do.
==Ingredients==
*Peanut oil (for frying)
*1 large chicken breast, sliced in thin strips
*2 eggs (do not beat!)
*4 cups [900g] ( cooked, cold (meaning refrigerated for a while) Thai jasmine rice
*1/2 yellow onion, chopped into strips
*3/4 roma tomato, also in strips
*2 green onions, thinly sliced
*3/4 cup (180g) cilantro (coriander), finely chopped
*Nam pla (Thai fish sauce, can be found in the ethinic section of the grocery store)
*Soy sauce
*Sugar (if you live in a part of the world where palm sugar is easily available, use that)
*Salt
*2 Cloves Fried garlic (made by mincing the cloves and frying them until brown in 2 Tablespoon oil. Save the oil with the garlic as well!)
==Optional==
*MSG
*Thai chili sauce(for a different kind of sweet flavor)
==For garnish==
*3 slices cucumber, peeled (note: can run fork down all sides lightly if desired)
*3 slices roma tomato
*3 sprigs green onion
*lettuce leaf
==Procedure==
#Make sure that all of the ingredients in small bowls right by the wok/large frying pan.
#Add about 4 Tablespoon peanut oil to the wok and turn the flame on high heat.
#When the oil is almost smoking, add the chicken strips and push around vigorously with a wok spoon or spatula.
#When the chicken seems like it is starting to brown, push it up the side of the wok and crack the eggs in it.
#Stir the eggs around a bit. When almost fully scrambled, mix in the chicken and stir around for 30 seconds more.
#Push the eggs/chicken to the side, add some more oil, and throw in the tomato and onion. Stir-fry for about 5 minutes. They will not look done, but in the end, they will be fine.
#Add the cold cooked rice and mix it all in.
#Turn the heat to low and then throw a few splashes of nam pla and soy sauce on to taste.
#Put about a tablespoon of sugar (or more if wanted), a teaspoon of salt (the same applies), a teaspoon of MSG if wanted, a splash of vinegar, and two tablespoons of chili sauce if wanted. Lastly, put the garlic on top as well.
# Stir it all in and turn off the heat.
# On a large platter, arrange the garnishes on a lettuce leaf, and plate the fried rice next to it.
# Invite whoever is dining to eat the garnishes with the fried rice.
# Enjoy!

The '''Falafel Seitan Bratwurst''' tastes better than falafel and better than [[Cookbook:Seitan_Bratwurst|seitan bratwurst]] and way better than traditional bratwurst made of meat. Your mileage may vary, of course.

==Ingredients==
* [[Cookbook:Gluten|gluten flour]], spiced [[Cookbook:Falafel|falafel mix]] (the chickpea variant, not the fava bean variant)
* water, [[Cookbook:Soy_sauce|soy sauce]], [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]]
* optional: [[Cookbook:Chili powder|chili powder]]

==Procedure==
* Mix gluten flour and falafel mix in equal shares.
* Take 25% (volume) more water than falafel-gluten mixture.
* Mix water with vegetable oil and soy sauce.
* Form a dough from the dry mixture and the liquid mixture.
* Roll the dough into sausages and fry them in a pan, preferably an oiled non-stick pan.
* If the dough is too runny you can form round sausages by squeezing from both sides with two [[w:Spatula|spatulas]] and frying the sausages on four sides. When you turn the sausages on the side you may also have to squeeze from above to give them an approximately round profile.

[[Image:Gulab Jamun.jpg|thumb|240px|Gulab Jamun, a popular Indian dessert.]]
'''Gulab Jamun''' is a popular [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Pakistan|Pakistani]] sweet dish comprised of fried milk balls in a sweet syrup flavoured with [[Cookbook:Cardamom|cardamom]] seeds and [[Cookbook:Rosewater|rosewater]] or [[Cookbook:Saffron|saffron]]. It originates from Bengal and is pronounced &quot;Gulab Jambuh&quot; in regional languages such as Gujarati.  Mixes and finished products are often available in supermarkets, though it is still popular to make it from scratch.

===Ingredients===
====Dough====
*3 cups (720ml) dry milk powder
*1 cup (240ml) [[Cookbook:Biscuit mix|Bisquick]]
*A bit more than 3/4 cup (200ml) warm milk
*2T butter, melted

====Syrup====
*2 cups (480ml) water
*2 1/2 (600ml) cups sugar
*4 cardamom pods

===Cooking===
#Preheat canola oil, 1.5-2 (4-5cm) inches deep in a small sauce pan.  Oil should be at medium heat.
#Add together the milk powder, Bisquick, and melted butter in a metal bowl.
#Slowly add the warmed milk, 2T at a time.  Use a wooden spoon to collect the dry ingredients into a dough ball.  Continue adding milk until all dry ingredients have been collected.  The dough should be firm and moist, but not sticky.  If you put too much milk, add a bit more dry ingredients (maintaining the ratio of 3 parts milk powder to 1 part bisquick).
#Roll into evenly sized balls (if they are not even, they will not cook at the same rate). As the balls dry out quickly, do not wait more than a few minutes before frying.
#Drop a few balls into the oil (don't overfill - they will get larger as they heat).  They will sink to the bottom, then float to the top of the oil.  They must be stirred regularly to keep them browning evenly.
#When dark brown, remove from the oil and place on paper to absorb the oil.
#Repeat until all are made.

===Syrup===
#Break cardamom seeds from their pods.
#Separate seeds and bash to release flavor.
#Mix water, syrup, and cardamom and heat for 10 minutes (do not overheat as syrup will caramelize).
#Transfer to dishes and combine to soak finished Gulam Jamuns overnight.
#Serve hot or cold.

'''Duck Frame Stock'''

== Ingredients ==
* Leftover bones from [[Cookbook:Roast Duck|roast duck]]
* Pan drippings
* [[Cookbook:Giblets|Giblets]] (gizzard, heart, neck, skinned/peeled duck feet)
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:salt|salt]] (or to taste)
* 6 cups (1200ml) [[Cookbook:water|water]]
* 1/2 tsp [[Cookbook:vinegar|vinegar]]

== Procedure ==
# Cook everything in a tightly covered heavy [[Cookbook:stock pot|stock pot]] over medium heat until it reaches a full rolling [[Cookbook:boil|boil]], then reduce heat and allow to [[Cookbook:simmer|simmer]] for 1 1/2 hours.  
# Drain liquid, discarding bones and reserving any meat.  

== Notes ==
* Don't worry about the vinegar spoiling the flavor of the stock; it cooks out and helps leach nutrients such as [[Cookbook:calcium|calcium]] from the bones, leaving no vinegary odor/flavor behind.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Desserts|Desserts]]

'''Gluten-Free Chocolate Chip Cookies''' - These cookies use [[Cookbook:Rice Flour|sweet rice flour]], also known as glutinous rice flour. Don't be fooled by the name; there's no gluten in glutinous rice flour (or any rice flour, for that matter). This flour, like most [[Cookbook:Gluten-Free|gluten-free]] flours, is easy to find if an Asian grocery can be located. It can also be found in many boutique grocery stores, such as Trader Joe's or Whole Foods. Other gluten-free flours may be substituted, but be prepared to adjust the amount of flour needed to compensate for variations in starchiness.

It should go without saying, for any household coping with celiac disease, that it is imperative to make sure all your ingredients, work surfaces, and utensils are free of gluten contamination. Special care should be taken with compound ingredients such as baking powder; make sure its ingredients list does not include gluten-containing items such as modified food starch.

The cookies are pictured to the right with various additions to the dough. Experimenting is encouraged, but please be careful choosing additions. Some of the cookies pictured have oats added, which introduce trace amounts of gluten and are '''not''' safe for celiacs.

==Equipment==
*Large [[Cookbook:Mixing Bowl|mixing bowl]]
*[[Cookbook:Mixer|Stand mixer]] and bowl (or a [[Cookbook:Mixer|hand-held mixer]] and a medium mixing bowl)
*Wooden spoon
*[[Cookbook:Cookie Sheet|Cookie sheet]]
*Non-stick [[Cookbook:silicone baking sheet liner|silicone baking sheet liner]] (Silpat, etc.)

==Ingredients==
*½ cup (1 stick) (120ml) [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*½ cup (120ml) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*½ cup (120ml) [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Eggs|eggs]]
*½ tsp [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla extract]]
*1¼ cup (300ml) (1 cup + 2 tablespoons) [[Cookbook:Rice Flour|sweet rice flour]]
*1 tsp [[Cookbook:Xanthan gum|xanthan gum]]
*¾ tsp [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
*½ tsp [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]]
*[[Cookbook:Chocolate chip|Chocolate chips]] (as many as you like)

==Procedure==
[[Image:Gluten-free chocolate chip cookie dough.jpg|thumb|The finished dough (with various additions), ready for baking]]
#Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).
#Mix the sweet rice flour, xanthan gum, baking powder and baking soda in a large mixing bowl.
#In a smaller mixing bowl or stand mixer, [[Cookbook:Creaming|cream]] the butter, sugar, and brown sugar. Add the eggs and vanilla and continue mixing.
#Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix thoroughly with a wooden spoon. Don't worry about over-mixing; since there is no gluten in the flour, there is no danger of overworking it.
#Fold in the chocolate chips.
#Line cookie sheet with silicone mat and spoon on balls of dough, about 1½&quot; (4cm) in diameter.
#Bake until golden brown.

==Notes==
This will likely take longer to bake than a gluten-containing cookie recipe—perhaps about 25 minutes. Baking time will depend on the flour you use, since the protein content of the flour will determine the rate of browning from the Maillard reaction.

The silicone baking sheet liner is important, as these cookies tend to stick to the pan more than most. If you don't have one, parchment paper might also work.

'''Mititei''' (grilled meatballs) is a typical Romanian dish. Usually in Romania you could find the prepared meat in most of the food shops, and you only have to cook them.

==Ingredients==
*minced [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] meat ([[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] or beef-pork combination would do too)
*minced [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
*[[Cookbook:White Pepper|white pepper]]
*[[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]]

==Procedure==
#All the ingredients are mixed together, forming a paste; the ingredients are not optional, and the quantities of condiments varies, according to the individual tastes.
#The meat paste is then shaped by hand, into [[Cookbook:cm|7-8 cm]] (3 [[Cookbook:Inch|inch]]) by 2-2.5 cm (1 inch) cylinders (about 50 [[Cookbook:g|grams]] each).
#It is best to [[Cookbook:Fry|fry]] them on a [[Cookbook:Barbecuing|barbecue]] grill, because they get additional flavour if a little smoked, but a [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]] is ok. DO NOT use [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]. It will only ruin the flavour. Try a spoon of [[Cookbook:Lard|pork fat]], or fry them in their own juice. It is best to not let them dry to much, they are better if they are juicy.
#You can eat them with [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]], and of course, [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] is necessary.

Makes 6 to 8 servings.

==Ingredients==

* 4 medium [[Cookbook:Tomatillo|tomatillos]], husked and rinsed (or used canned if unavailable)
* 2 [[Cookbook:Jalapeño|jalapeños]], stemmed 
* 1/2 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], peeled and quartered 
* 2 [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] clove, peeled 
* 1 handful fresh [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]] leaves, coarsely chopped 
* 1 [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]], juiced 
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Toasting|toasted]] [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]] seeds 
* Kosher (coarse or margarita) [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] 
* 1/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [60ml] (1/2 stick) unsalted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] 
* 1/4 cup all-purpose [60ml] [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] 
* 2 cups [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] (480ml) [[Cookbook:Stock|stock]], at room temperature 
* 4 cups shredded (950ml) [[Cookbook:Jack Cheese|Jack cheese]] 
* 1 (1-[[Cookbook:Pound|pound]]) (450g) bag salted corn tortilla chips 
* 1 (3-pound) whole (1350g) [[Cookbook:Roasting|roasted]] chicken, [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]] finely shredded, skin and bones discarded

'''Quick [[Cookbook:Salsa|Salsa]]:'''

* 1 [[Cookbook:Pint|pint]] (570ml) cherry [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], halved 
* 2 green [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], white and green parts, chopped 
* 1 jalapeno, chopped 
* 2 handfuls fresh [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]] leaves, hand shredded 
* 2 [[Cookbook:Lime Juice|limes, juiced]] 
* Kosher (coarse or margarita) [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and freshly ground [[Cookbook:Black Pepper|black pepper]] 

* [[Cookbook:Sour Cream|Sour cream]] and [[Cookbook:Guacamole|guacamole]], for serving

==Preparation==

Bring a pot of water to a [[Cookbook:Boiling|boil]]; add the tomatillos, jalapenos, onion, and garlic. [[Cookbook:Simmer|Simmer]] for 10 to 15 minutes, until the tomatillos are soft. Drain and cool slightly, then put them in a [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]]. Add the cilantro, lime juice, and cumin. [[Cookbook:Pureeing|Puree]] for a few seconds to blend, and then pour in about a 1/4 cup of water and process to a coarse puree; taste and season with a generous pinch of salt. You should have about 2 cups of this green salsa (''salsa verde''). 
Make a [[Cookbook:Roux|roux]] by melting the butter over medium-low heat in a thick-bottomed [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]]. Just as the foam subsides, sprinkle in the flour, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or [[Cookbook:Whisk|whisk]] to prevent lumps. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes to remove the starchy taste from the flour; don't allow it to [[Cookbook:Browning|brown]]. Gradually whisk in the chicken stock and simmer for 8 minutes to thicken. Once you have a good base, fold in 2 cups of the shredded Jack cheese; mix until completely melted into a [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce]]. Stir in the prepared salsa verde until incorporated; remove the green chili cheese sauce from the heat. 

Make a quick salsa by combining the cherry tomatoes, onions, jalapeno, cilantro, and lime juice in a bowl; season with salt and pepper, tossing to combine. 

To build these awesome nachos: Preheat the oven to [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|350 degrees F]] (180c). Get a very large [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]]-proof platter and cover it with a few handfuls of tortilla chips, follow with a portion of the shredded chicken, a coating of the cheese sauce, and a nice sprinkle of the remaining shredded jack. Make 3 or 4 layers of the nachos, depending on the size of the platter. Bake the nachos until they are all hot and gooey, about 5 to 10 minutes. 

Spoon the tomato salsa over the top of the nachos and serve with the sour cream on the side.

'''Roasted Vegetable Pasta''' This is a tried and true favorite.  You can add whatever vegetables you prefer.  

==Ingredients==
*3 large leeks, white parts only, split in half lengthwise and cut to bites sized pieces 
*1 medium red onion, whacked into eighths 
*1 red bell pepper (sometimes use 2) cut into wide strips 
*olive oil
*2 fresh sprigs of thyme 
*vegetable stock or water 
*4 large garlic cloves, chopped 
*1 1/2 cups (360ml) tomato sauce 
*1/2 cup (120ml) chopped fresh basil 
*1/4 cup (60ml) white wine 
*1 tablespoon (or less) of salt 
*3/4 pound (330g)dried penne pasta (doesn't have to be penne) 
*1/3 cup (80ml) grated Parmesan cheese 
*optional:  3 ounces (85g) mozzarella or goat cheese 

==Procedure==
#Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. (220c) 
#Put leeks, onion, and red bell pepper in a shallow roasting pan, tossing them with a tablespoon of olive oil to coat them. Add thyme and roast until they are cooked and start to brown (about 30-45 minutes).  Hint: check early to make sure they're not burning, and add a little water or vegetable stock if the juices are evaporating. 
#While vegetables are roasting, saute the garlic in a tablespoon of olive oil until it begins to colour.  Add the tomato sauce and simmer 1 minute.  Then turn off heat and add the basil.  Stir the roasted vegetables into the sauce.  Gorgeous! 
#Turn oven down to 375 F (190c).  Add wine to roasting pan and stir, scraping up bits of vegetables that are stuck to pan, and add these deglazed juices to the sauce. 
#Boil large pot of water and add the salt and pasta - undercook the pasta - should take only 6-8 minutes. 
#Drain pasta, add it to the sauce and vegetables.  Add the cheese and mix it all.  Grease a 2 to 2 1/2 quart casserole dish and pour it all in.  Top with the optional mozzarella or goat cheese if you like, then bake it all for another 15 minutes in the 375 F (190c) oven.

'''Salted mustard greens and shredded meat noodle soup''' (&amp;#38634;&amp;#33756;&amp;#32905;&amp;#32114;&amp;#40629;) is a Chinese dish composed of salted mustard greens (&amp;#38634;&amp;#35041;&amp;#32005;), shredded pork (&amp;#32905;&amp;#32114;), soup stock, and noodles.  Many Chinese restaurants in the US serve this dish.  All quantities are approximate.

* [[Cookbook:Pork|pork tenderloin]]
* [[Cookbook:Corn Starch|corn starch]]
* [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]
* [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* [[Cookbook:Stock|soup stock]]
* cooked [[Cookbook:Pasta|noodles]]

'''Seitan''' is a food made from [[Cookbook:Gluten|gluten]] protein that has been extracted from wheat flour. It has a springy and somewhat rubbery texture that makes it a reasonable replacement for meat in vegan or vegetarian dishes.

== Ingredients ==
* 10 oz (280g) High-gluten wheat flour (such as bread flour)
* Water

== Procedure ==

# Add 2 cups water to 10 oz (280g) high-gluten wheat flour (such as bread flour).
# Knead together until '''well-combined''' and elastic. It is advisable to keep hands wet so that the gluten doesn't stick to the hands.
# Cover with water and place in refrigerator for 1 hour. 
# Knead under water until water is cloudy; dump cloudy water and replace with clear, cold water. In the beginning the dough can still easily dissolve underwater so it is advisable to only cautiously squeeze it against the bowl. Later you might find it easier to knead over the water, squeezing out the water, and only to dip the mass into the water to wash off the [[w:starch|starch]], if the mass contains too much water you easily wash out gluten as well. The enriched water can be used to gain the insoluble starch, which settles on the bottom of the container, and what remains can serve as a base for [[w:grain_milk|grain milk]].
# Continue kneading and replacing water until water remains clear after kneading.
# Divide gluten mass into loaf- or roll-shaped halves. You can also add spices to the dough itself. Adding [[Cookbook:soy_sauce|soy sauce]] is recommended.
# Place halves in pot, cover with vegetable broth or ''[[Cookbook:dashi|dashi]]''.
# Bring to a boil.
# Reduce heat to simmer; simmer for 1 - 1 1/2 hours.
# Remove from heat and serve as desired or use in place of meat.

Unused portions of Seitan can be kept in broth under refrigeration for up to a week, or can be frozen (drained from broth) for up to a month.

This will make approximately 28 oz (790g). of gluten. Because of their high protein content, gluten &quot;steaks&quot; can be grilled and fried to good effect.

== Notes, tips and variations ==
* To avoid the washing process you can also buy 100% gluten flour in some stores. This flour would require only enough water to form it into a solid mass.
* Gluten created using just gluten flour can be rubbery and has a very &quot;gluteny&quot; taste. Adding 1 part garbanzo bean flour to 4 parts gluten flour makes for a less chewey texture and a better flavor.

'''Soup alla Maria Pia'''

Ingredients:  White stock (chicken or veal), eggs, butter, peas, white beans (haricot or flagelot - not lima or butter beans), carrot, onion, leeks, celery, cream, croutons.

Soak one pound of white beans for twelve hours, then put them into a stock pot with a little salt, butter, and water, add a carrot, an onion, two leeks, and a stick of celery, and simmer until the
vegetables are well cooked; then take out all the fresh vegetables, drain the beans and pass them through a sieve, but first dilute them with good stock.  Put this puree into a stock pot with good
white stock, and when it has boiled keep it hot in a [[bain-marie]] until you are about to serve; then mix the yolk of three eggs in a cup of cream, and add this to the soup.  Pour the soup into a warm
tureen, add some boiled green peas, and serve with fried croutons handed separately.

'''Soup alla Modenese''' is a type of soup made with chicken or veal stock, spinach, butter, salt, eggs, Parmesan cheese, nutmeg and croutons.

One pound of spinach is washed in five or six waters, then chopped very fine and mixed with three ounces of butter and some salt. The mixture is then heat and cooled, passed through a hair sieve (or pureed in a blender or processor) and combined with a tablespoon of grated Parmesan cheese, two eggs and a small amount of nutmeg, then combined with boiling stock. Sometimes, hot coals are placed on top of the lid to the saucepan so that the eggs will curdle and thicken the soup, which is served with fried croutons.

[[Image:Masa madre.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Sourdough starter]]

Sourdough is generally considered wild yeast, though it is actually a mixture of yeast and lacto-bacteria that together form the flavor of sourdough.  The yeast however is the leavening, and thus more important for cooking.

The flavor and nature of a given sourdough depends strongly on the location.  The famous San Francisco sourdough grows only in (and near) the city of San Francisco; if taken elsewhere the local yeasts and bacteria will soon grow, and in a few months it will no longer be San Francisco sourdough, but sourdough of the new location.  For this reason, sourdough fans often trade batches with locals every few months, to get a flavor or yeast action that cannot be had locally.

Because each local variation is different, rising times and flavors are different. Thus some, though not all, batches can take up to a full day to rise. This will also affect the flavor. 

Cooking with sourdough must be planned days or even weeks in advance to ensure sufficient starter is on hand.   Bread can take 3 days between starting and baking, not counting time to prepare the starter. 

==Obtaining starter==
Sourdough starter is alive. Thus the easiest way to get starter is find someone with it, and borrow a small amount and increase it. If you wish to have a starter other than whatever is local, this is the only way to get it.

==Making your own starter==
If you cannot find a source of starter it is easy to make your own. Here is how it is done:

===Ingredients===
*unbleached [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] (wholegrain flour works best)
*chlorine free [[Cookbook:Water|water]]

Bleached flour or tap water can be used, but these may give undesirable results. Chlorine in tap water can kill the wild yeast that you wish to grow. Bleached flour has most of the yeasts killed.

===Method===
Combine 1 tablespoon of flour with 1 tablespoon of water and let sit overnight at room temperature. 
Each day add 1 tablespoon of water and one tablespoon flour and mix until the total volume is about 1 cup (240ml).  The symbiotic combination of yeasts and lactobacilli can be encouraged to reproduce more easily by controlling the pH (acidity) of the mixture using pineapple juice instead of water for the first three days and maintaining a temperature of 75 degrees F.  Make sure that you have a working starter by observing whether the dough bubbles and rises.  If not, then leave exposed to the air and test again.   Thereafter, dump out ½ cup (120ml), and mix in ½ cup (120ml) water and ½ cup (120ml) flour.   Starter will be ready in 1 or 2 weeks, though the longer the better.   There is a noticeable difference between a 1-week and a 1-month starter, and some can tell a difference between 1 month and 1 year.   Some will claim it takes 40 years to get a good starter, though nobody waits that long to use it.
The exact volumes used above are not critical.  Use whatever measure you consider useful.

The above open-air method takes patience.  You may have to repeat this procedure several times as there is no guarantee that you will pick up good yeasts floating in the air (there are many yeasts, but most will not make for good bread). The only way to tell is to wait until you get a critical mass of yeasts and see if it makes good bread.  Generally, bad yeasts will smell strange.  Your starter should always smell clean, perhaps with a sharp touch of alcohol/acid if it is getting old.

There is a second method that is more likely to proceed, but you lose the locality effect.  Take some organic grapes.  Wash them to knock off any dust or dirt, and immerse them in a bowl of clean water (as above) for 15 minutes.  Remove the grapes from the water, which now contains the yeast that was growing on the outside of the grapes.  If the grapes are local, then you have a local starter.  Use ½ cup of the water and ½ cup flour to make a paste/dough, place in a small cup, cover and wait.  If the dough rises, then you have a working starter.  Build by doubling until you reach your desired volume.

A third method is to use a little [[Cookbook:Kefir|kefir]] to initiate the sourdough starter. As with grapes, you will not get the effect of using a localised starter, but it is a reliable and effective method. Mix ½ cup of water and ½ cup of flour to make a paste/dough, add ½ teaspoon of kefir, mix well, and set aside to ferment. Give it a stir every eight hours or so. It should be very active within 24 hours, possibly as few as 12.

==Keeping starter==
Sourdough starter is alive, and thus it must be fed regularly.   When not using your starter, it is important to dump out half the batch from time to time, and mix in fresh flour and water to equal the lost volume.  Exactly how often this should be done depends on storage temperatures and the local strain. An active starter should be fed daily (if not multiple times per day depending on temperature and other conditions).  See the note below about dormant starters.

Sourdough is best stored at room temperature or slightly warmer.  Anything outside of this range will change the proportions of the bacteria and yeast, which affects the flavor of the result. It can be safely stored in the fridge, but temperatures over 80F are too hot. If you store your starter in the fridge, then let it sit out several hours after feeding before returning it to the refrigerator.  This allows the yeasts to get active and feed.  The temperature in the fridge is enough to slow down the yeast, but not the lacto-bacteria.  So after a while your starter will begin to smell boozy and have a sharper tang to it than you might want.  To fix this, just dump out 90% and start the feeding cycle again.

Long-term storage can be done by drying some starter, causing the yeast to go dormant.  Exactly how long yeast can be stored this way varies, but it is enough for trading starters.

If you do not bake daily, then your starter will go dormant as the yeasts shut down from hunger.  You may see a separation occur in the starter vessel, where a yellowish clear liquid rises to the top and the white doughy starter falls to the bottom.  The liquid is rich in yeast metabolic by-products.  You can mix it back in when you feed, but it sharpens the finished bread flavor to a degree that you may find distasteful.  Simply throw out the liquid before feeding.  But you should note that once your starter has gone dormant, you must re-invigorate by multiple feedings to get it back to a healthful vigor (see below). 

==Using starter==
Using starter is easy, just take out the amount you need, and then mix equal parts flour and water to get back the original amount.  Avoid using all the starter on hand, though if you must, enough will cling to the sides of the pot to get the starter going again.

If using starter often you should keep your batches large enough so that enough is on hand.  If you rarely use your starter you should keep just a small amount on hand, and increase it before needed.

You need to make sure that your starter is full strength before committing it to a dough.  That means that it should quadruple if fed and left for an hour.  Feed starter and put ¼ cup in a measuring cup.  If it hits the one cup marker in an hour or so then it is ready to go.  If not, then it needs to be fed.  Accelerate your feeding schedule until it passes the above test.

==Increasing==
Many recipes call for more starter than is kept on hand.   Starter is easily increased, just dump in more flour and water.  It is generally best to do no more than double at a time. Depending on how vigorous your starter is it may take 2 days to get 4 cups from one cup (see above). (Remember to leave enough leftover for the next batch of starter though.)

I was given this recipe in college, roughly in late 1998.  My friend who was teaching me to make sushi, and taught me this.  I liked it as an appetizer to help introduce Japanese flavors to those who were not used to them. I've found success with it also as a type of sushi that those who are vegan, anti-seafood, or just squeamish will eat.  It's non traditional - but very good.  Please enjoy.

==Ingredients==
* 1/4 cup (60ml) Fine Shredded Carrot
* 1/4 cup (60ml) Thin Julienned Onion
* 1/4 cup (60ml) Fine Diced Celery
* 1/4 cup (60ml) Thin Julienned Daikon
* 2 tablespoons Miso
* 2 oz (55g) Sake
* 1/2 cup (120ml) water
* 1/2 teaspoon Rice Vinegar
* 1/2 teaspoon Wasabi
* 1 1/2 cups (360ml) Sushi Rice
* 2 Nori

==Instructions==
In a wok or saucepan (I suggest a saucepan, personally) combine vegetables and sake.  Bring to a simmer and let cook until most of the sake is gone, stirring often.  Now add the water and miso, bring this to a simmer, and let it cook until the vegetables are soft (but not mushy) stirring often.  Next remove the vegetables from the pan and reduce the remaining liquid to a thick sauce consistency.  Pour the 'sauce' over the vegetables and mix thoroughly.  Let cool.  Mix in vinegar.  Evenly spread rice over nori, dab half the wasabi across each, then place the vegetable mix across this.  Roll tightly.  Should serve 3-4.

A '''sticky date pudding''' is a favorite Australian pudding, especially in Southern climates in the winter months.

Your family and friends will love you forever if you make them the following recipe, but warning, exceedingly diet unfriendly.

==Ingredients==
*4 eggs (at room temperature for best results)
*1½ cups (360ml) of castor sugar
*1 cup (240ml) of light oil
*2 tsp of vanilla essence
*2 cups (480ml) of plain four
*1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
*2 tsp salt
*2 tsp mixed spice
*1 cup (240ml) pitted dates
*2 cups (480ml) brown sugar
*1 cup (240ml) water
*Further tsp bicarbonate of soda
*500ml cream
 
==Utensils==
*double saucepan
*mixer for cake (a free standing one is better, as you need to beat the eggs for some time for best results)
*sieve or four sifter
*large cake tin, MUST be lined with paper &amp; well greased.  I prefer a log tin rather than a round one
*wax proof baking paper
*Preheated oven to 180°C

==Method==
*Place 2 cup brown sugar and 1 cup of water in top of double saucepan, 
*Over simmering heat stir until caramel formed (i.e. all brown sugar dissolved)
*Remove top saucepan, set aside to cool.
*Chop dates roughly, place in saucepan, cover with only enough water to cover and add 1 tsp bicarb.
*Bring to boil, and simmer for 1 minute (it will froth up from the bicarb, if so remove from heat once foam reaches the top of the saucepan)
*Set aside to cool
*Preheat oven to 180°C
*Grease and line cake tin.  (Cannot emphasise enough that the tin MUST be papered - I learnt the hard way.)
*Sift dry ingredients (I like to do this twice)
*Beat eggs lightly
*Add castor sugar and beat as for making a sponge; really light and fluffy
*Fold in oil and vanilla essence, but don’t over-mix this otherwise you’ll lose all the air in the egg mixture
*Fold in the sifted flour, bicarb, and salt.
*Fold in the cooled date mixture
*Pour into prepared tin
*Bake in oven @180°C for about 80-90 minutes, not too high in the oven otherwise the top will burn.  Cooking time and temperature can be reduced slightly if a fan forced oven is used
*Test cake with skewer, skewer should come out dry 
*Remove from oven leave pudding in the papered tin
*Use a skewer to create lots of holes throughout the hot pudding
*Pour approximately 1 cup of caramel mixture onto the hot pudding; this will soak into the holes of the pudding

==Butterscotch Sauce==

1 cup of brown sugar
100g butter
1 cup of cream

place all ingredients in saucepan stirring ocassionaly for 3 minutes. pour over warm sticky date pudding and serve with cream and strawberries (optional)

==When ready to serve==

*tip cake out of pan
*slice into desired portions
*place slice in bowl, drizzle with Butterscotch sauce
*serve immediately with cream or ice cream

'''Serves &gt; 1'''

== Ingredients ==
* 1 large, ripe tomato
* 1 large, or 2 small culinary mushrooms
* 1 sliced onion slab, or coin, approx 1/4th inch (0.5cm) thick.
* 4 fresh basil leaves, or 2 tsp dried basil
* 2 tbls fresh parsley, or 2 tsp dried parsley flakes
* 1 tsp dill weed
* 2 dashes black pepper
* 1 dash of garlic powder
* 1 dash salt
* 5 drops cooking oil

== Procedure ==
# On the head of a fresh tomato, cut two concentric rings, one near the stem, the other near the slope of the tomato's shoulder. 
# Remove this ring to expose the juicy seed compartments. 
# Slice the mushrooms into small, flat slabs, and cut the onion coin in quarters, like a pie or quiche. Separate the layers.
# In the open ring sprinkle the dried spices. 
# Force the mushrooms and small arcs of onion through the spices and into the seed compartments, pushing the basil/dill/parsley/etc in with them. Stuff in as many as possible without forcing out tomato pulp. If using fresh basil leaves, fold them over the slices of mushrooms and push them in together.
# Drizzle five or so drops of cooking oil in a spot on a baking sheet or small roasting flat. Rub in a small circle with a diameter equal to the foot, or butt of the tomato. 
# Place the tomato on the oil and the pan into an oven preheated to 350° (180c). 
# Roast for 15 to 20 minutes.

'''Note:''' the onion slice will produce enough pieces for at least four stuffed tomatoes. If making several, one should be all you need.

==Ingredients==
* 1.5 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] (200 mL) of dry, short-grain Japanese [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]]
* 3 cups (400 mL) of water
* 1 sheet, ''[[Cookbook:Kombu|kombu]]'' Note: you don't have to use kombu; it's used to give the rice its texture.
* 4 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] (50 mL) of rice vinegar
* 2 tablespoons  (25 mL) of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] (2 mL) of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 

The proportions of ingredients in this recipe produce a typical dressing, but regional variations exist, traditionally based on latitude and the season. In Tokyo, chefs often use a bit more salt; in Osaka, the dressing typically has more sugar. And, of course, recipes vary with the style of the individual chef.

To be precise on the variations:
* amount of water can fluctuate between 1,5 cups and 4,5 cups
* amount of rice vinegar can fluctuate between 4 and 5 tablespoons
* amount of sugar can fluctuate between 2 and 2,5 tablespoons
* amount of salt can fluctuate between 0,5 and 2 teaspoons

Also, sometimes mirin may be used in the seasoned rice vinegar recipe;
A recipe for seasoned rice vinegar is for example:
* 4 tablespoons of rice vinegar
* 2 tablespoons of table sugar
* 2 teaspoons of mirin

==Utensils==
* Rice cooker
* [[w:Hangiri|Hangari]] (rice barrel), ''optional''
* [[w:Shamoji|Shamoji]] (rice paddle), ''optional''
* [[w:Fukin|Fukin]] (cloth), ''optional''

===Instructions===
About 30 minutes before starting, fill the ''hangiri'' with water and let it stand. The water saturates the wood, which prevents the rice from sticking to it.

# Make the seasoned rice vinegar dressing
## Mix the vinegar, sugar, and salt.
## Heat the mixture in a sauce pan until everything is dissolved, but do not [[Cookbook:Boiling|boil]].
## Set aside to cool.
# Cook the rice
## Rinse the rice. Put the rice in the cooking pot, half filled with cold water, and swirl it around with your hand. The water will turn chalky white. Carefully drain off the water, and repeat the process several times, until the water remains clear.
## Allow the rice to stand for 30 minutes. Some recipes say the rice should remain in the cooking pot submerged in its cooking water; others say to transfer it temporarily to a colander to drain.
## Add a postcard-sized sheet of ''kombu'' to the cooking pot, and the ''sake'' if you are using it.
## Boil the water in the cooking pot.
## Remove the ''kombu'' from the cooking pot just as the water boils, and reduce the heat.
## Simmer the water and rice in the cooking pot for 20 minutes.
## Turn off the heat but do '''not''' remove cover from the cooking pot for 10 minutes (no peeking).
# Add the dressing to the rice. The rice and dressing should be mixed immediately after the rice is finished cooking with dressing at room temperature.
## Transfer the rice from the cooking pot to the hangiri; if you do not have one, use a large bowl or [[Cookbook:Cookie Sheet|cookie sheet]].
## Cut the vinegar dressing gently into rice with the paddle, trying not to break the kernels. When finished, the rice is evenly coated with the dressing, giving it a shiny appearance.
## Cover the rice with a cloth for a couple of minutes so the dressing is absorbed.
## Cool the rice to body temperature by fanning it, while continuing to stir it with the spatula.

The faster the rice cools, the better. It is best if used quickly: you can use it to make sushi for a few hours; it certainly cannot be prepared a day early.

* '''Alternately rather than mix the vinegar and sugar and salt, packaged powdered sushi vinegar can be used.  It is added to the rice and mixed in while it is still warm.'''

'''''Tapenade''''' is a traditional provencale paste of olives, anchovies and capers. Although some versions exclude the capers, the word ''tapenade'' has its origins in the provencale ''tapena'' (caper).

== Ingredients ==
*6 [[Cookbook:Anchovy|anchovies]]
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Caper|capers]], rinsed and drained
*1 cup (240ml) pitted black [[Cookbook:Olive|olives]]
*Extra virgin [[Cookbook:Olive oil|olive oil]]

== Procedure ==

# Blend the anchovies, capers and olives.  
# For this a [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]] is better than the traditional [[Cookbook:Mortar and Pestle|mortar and pestle]].
# Add a few tablespoons olive oil until smooth.

Serve on [[Cookbook:Toast|toast]] as an [[Cookbook:Amuse-Bouche|amuse-bouche]], or with boiled [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]], or with [[Cookbook:Feta Cheese|goats cheese]] and roasted [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|peppers]], or on [[Cookbook:Pasta|potato gnocchi]].

TEQUEÑOS. Yields 12 tequeños

This highly addictive appetizer originated in Los Teques, Venezuela (hence the name). Pronounced &quot;teh-kehn-yos&quot;

== Ingredients ==
* 2 lb (900g) all-purpose flour 
* 4 x egg yolks 
* 1/2 lb (225g) butter room temperature 
* 1 cup (240ml) water 
* 1/2 tsp salt 
* 1 tbl sugar 
* 2 lb (900g) farmer's cheese 

== Procedure ==
# Dissolve the salt and sugar in the water.
# Mix all ingredients except the cheese together. Knead to form a dough. Let rest.
# Meanwhile, cut cheese into sticks about 2&quot; x 1/2&quot; x 1/2&quot; (5cm x 1.25cm x 1.25cm).
# Stretch the dough with a rolling pin, as thin as possible. 
# Cut in strips about 1&quot; x 6&quot; (2.5cm x 15cm). 
# Wrap each strip around a cheese stick, going around the stick in a spiral, overlapping each turn so that the cheese is completely covered. 
# Pinch the ends so that the cheese is fully covered and can't run out when fried.
# Roll each tequeno in flour, to keep them from sticking. 
# Deep fry the tequenos in very hot oil, until golden in color. 
# Place on paper towels to absorb any excess oil.

Serve right away. Should be eaten piping hot, so that the cheese runs out when bitten.

== Ingredients ==
* 500 g yogurt 
* 1 cup (240ml) water 
* 1 or 2 diced cucumbers (diced is far better than grated, although at many restaurants they grate them) 
* a couple of spoonfuls chopped dill 
* salt, vinegar and oil to taste 
* optional: a couple of spoonfuls chopped walnuts 

== Procedure ==
Mix all the ingredients and serve cold in a soup dish. Use enough water so the soup is about the consistency of milk. Add a couple ice cubes if it's not cold.

If you use all of the above ingredients without the water and strain the yogurt until it becomes half in volume, you can make a salad. It is referred to as  [[&quot;Snezhanka&quot;]] (Snow White) or mlechna salata (yogurt salad). The main difference is that use pickels/gherkins for Snezhanka and fresh cucumbers for Mlechna Salata.

== Welcome ==

Cooked according to classic preparation rules, Tafelspitz (literally translated: the point of the table) is known to have been Austrian Hungarian Emperor Francis Joseph's favourite meal. Viennese “Tafelspitz” for Austrians is not only a way to boil beef, but is a whole special culinary science prepared with a special cut of beef. It is not a pot roast. The authentic Tafelspitz requires a custom-cut fresh piece of the hind part of beef (comparable to the American tri tip, also called silver tip); on the North American market, a substitute can be fresh beef chuck brisket (not corned brisket).

The secrets of a juicy Tafelspitz are: heating the water to a rolling boil before the piece of meat is put in the water; the sudden sealing of the meat’s juices as soon as the meat’s pores close when the Tafelspitz touches the boiling water; not too much salt, but enough to enhance the meat’s flavour; a few pieces of vegetables (sometimes also sections of bones with marrow), the right cooking time, and the gentle rolling of the boiling water which will cook but not break the meat’s fibre. This recipe is a simplified version of this very Austrian dish.

== Ingredients ==

* 2 ½ pounds (1200g) of either fresh beef brisket, silverside or sirloin-enough water for your suitable Dutch oven pot (about 5 Qt. (700ml) Pot capacity with about 4 Qts. (560ml) Of water) + salt (about ½ tablespoon for every Qt. Of water).
* 3 whole cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], slightly crushed, peeled.
* 3 whole green (freeze dried) or white [[Cookbook:Pepper|peppercorns]].
* 2 [[Cookbook:Juniper Berry|juniper berries]] (you may substitute with 1 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaf]]).
* 3 whole medium size [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]], peeled, trimmed (about 4 oz. [110g)]).
* 1 small-medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], trimmed, unpeeled, halved (about 2 oz [55g]).
* 3 sprigs fresh [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]].

== Procedure ==

In a suitable covered Dutch oven, bring water to a rolling boil over medium heat. When the water boils, add meat, garlic, peppercorns, juniper berries, and cover. Bring the water to a boil again and add carrots, onion, and parsley. Cover and let everything simmer for 60 minutes. Turn the meat over, add salt, and let everything cook, covered, for 90 additional minutes. Switch off the heat and let the meat steep for 20 minutes. Remove the meat from the broth and cut meat across the grain when you serve it. Serve Tafelspitz with “Apfelkren” and your choice of raw and cooked vegetables.

Note :Keep the broth for soups. Cut cold meat leftovers in thin strips and use like a meat salad mixed with raw sliced onions dressed with a simple oil, vinegar, salt and pepper vinaigrette.

How to make “Apfelkren” (apple horseradish sauce) for Tafelspitz: Combine and blend 1 pound Golden Delicious apples, cored, peeled, grated and cooked until very mushy with 1 Tablespoon wine vinegar, 1 Tablespoon lemon juice and 3 Tablespoons prepared horseradish.

'''Fruity Cheese Dogs''' are a quick fix for a kid who definitely needs more sugar in their system. The healthiness of this concoction is questionable, so it is advised that you limit servings to once every so often. 

==Ingredients==
* 2 jumbo [[Cookbook:Hot_Dog|Hot Dogs]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|Cup]] (240ml) of melted [[Cookbook:Cheese|Cheese]] ([[Cookbook:Mozzarella|Mozzarella]], [[Cookbook:Cheddar|Cheddar]], [[Cookbook:Swiss_Cheese|Swiss]], or any cheese that melts easily and is not very creamy)
* 1/8 [[Cookbook:Cup|Cup]] (30ml) of crushed froot loops (or any equivalent fruity breakfast cereal)

==Procedure==
# Cook the [[Cookbook:Hot_Dog|Hot Dogs]] in any manner; the original recipe used a pan on a stove, but a toaster oven would suffice. Once the [[Cookbook:Hot_Dog|Hot Dogs]] have cooked (you can tell that they are ready once they split), remove them from the heat source.
# Melt the cheese either in the oven or the microwave (microwave works best), and pour the melted [[Cookbook:Cheese|Cheese]] on the [[Cookbook:Hot_Dog|Hot Dogs]]
# Sprinkle the Froot Loop chunks over the cheese and let cool

==Notes==
* It works best when the [[Cookbook:Hot_Dog|Hot Dogs]] are closer together on the serving plate so that any stray Froot Loops are caught in between.
* Also, this is quite [[Cookbook:Sugar|Sugary]], so it is not recommended for those who don't enjoy large amounts of [[Cookbook:Sugar|Sugar]]

This recipe for '''beanburgers''' has been adapted from a Somerfield recipe as part of a [[w:Food Technology|Food Technology]] GCSE course in the UK. By &quot;adapted&quot;, I mean &quot;changed almost unrecognisably&quot;. The original is [http://www.somerfield.co.uk/foodanddrink/recipes/recipesearch/recipe.asp?recipe=Beany+Burgers+%26+Tomato+Salsa here]: you can see for yourself.

These beanburgers work best in [[Cookbook:Pita|pita breads]] (crisped up in the oven), with tomato and lettuce. Alternatively, they taste nice with a spicy tomato sauce.

== Ingredients ==
* 1 medium [[Cookbook:onion|onion]], chopped
* 1 red or yellow [[Cookbook:bell pepper|bell pepper]], chopped
* A generous pinch of each of: [[Cookbook:cumin|cumin]], [[Cookbook:Coriander|ground coriander]], [[Cookbook:chilli powder|mild chilli powder]], [[Cookbook:paprika|paprika]] and [[Cookbook:turmeric|turmeric]]
* 2 tins of mixed [[Cookbook:beans|beans]] or mixed [[Cookbook:pulses|pulses]], drained
* 2-3 medium [[Cookbook:carrot|carrot]]s, grated
* 40g [[Cookbook:rolled oats|rolled oats]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:egg|egg]] (leave out to make it Vegan. Without it, the burger breaks and frays much more in the pan)

== Procedure ==
# [[Cookbook:Fry|Fry]] the onions and pepper (in a little bit of oil) with the spices for a couple of minutes. Leave to cool.
# Mash the beans in a large bowl.
# Add the carrot, onion, pepper and oats to the mashed beans and mix until well combined.
# Add the egg slowly (you probably won't need all of it). You don't want a mixture that's too sticky.
# Shape the dough into 6 to 8 burgers and lightly flour each side.
# Fry the burgers (in a little bit of oil) for a few minutes on each side, until golden.
# Serve hot.

This '''[[Cookbook:Fermentation|fermented]] salsa''' recipe produces a tangy tomato sauce with strong flavour and [[w:probiotic|probiotic]] goodness. No cooking is required.

==Ingredients==
[[Image:Salsa ferment ingredients.jpg|right|thumb|The ingredients. We'd run out of fresh chilis that day, so we used chili powder instead.]]
* 1 kg (2 lb) fresh [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
* 1 large [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|capsicum]] (bell pepper)
* 3-6 fresh [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chilis]]
* 1 fresh [[Cookbook:Onion|red onion]]
* 3-4 cloves of [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic]]
* 1 bunch of fresh [[Cookbook:cilantro|cilantro]] (coriander leaf, Chinese parsley)
* 1-2 teaspoons non-iodised [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
* [[Cookbook:Spices and herbs|spices]] to taste (optional)

==Preparation==
[[Image:Salsa ferment.jpg|right|thumb|Salsa packed lightly into a jar.]]
# Clean and dry a large (1 litre) preserves jar and a large bowl
# [[Cookbook:Dice|Dice]] the tomatoes
# [[Cookbook:Quarter|Quarter]] and [[Cookbook:Slice|slice]] the capsicum
# Finely slice the chilis, removing the seeds if you prefer; take care not to touch your eyes!
# Peel and chop the onion and garlic finely
# Roughly chop the cilantro
# Mix all ingredients together in the bowl with salt and (optional) spices; mix well!
# Pack tightly into the jar, leaving 1cm space at the top; don't seal the jar yet

==Fermentation==

With the above fresh ingredients, there should be enough microbial load for the salsa to start fermenting by itself. Bubbles will begin rising to the top of the jar, showing that fermentation is under way - you should be able to see this through the side of the jar. Don't seal the jar while it is fermenting, as it will build up gas pressure and might break the jar. Just cover with a cloth, or cling-wrap. Sit the jar in a bowl or on a plate, so that any juice that might overflow will be collected and won't make a mess.

If you are concerned that fermentation will not start by itself, you can add a starter culture. A good starter culture is a little juice from a recently fermented [[Cookbook:sauerkraut|sauerkraut]] or [[Cookbook:kimchi|kimchi]], as this will bring across the necessary [[w:lactic acid bacteria|lactic acid bacteria]] and [[w:yeast|yeasts]].

The salsa will be fermented in two to three days. Wipe any excess liquid from around the jar, and put the lid on tightly before moving it to the refrigerator. It will last well in the fridge, but will continue to slowly ferment, getting more sour as time passes. Best within a few days, unless you like it quite sour!

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*The salt used should be non-iodised salt if possible - e.g. pickling salt, kosher salt. This is because the iodine in iodised table salt will inhibit the fermentation a little. Use what you've got, but best results will be obtained without the iodine.
*Use fresh ingredients where possible; if you do use canned or dried ingredients, you may need to use a starter (see Fermentation, above)
*There is a suggestion on the [[{{TALKPAGENAME}}|talk page]] that more salt is required; read the discussion and decide for yourself, but traditional French recipes add no salt during the fermentation of crushed tomatoes

==Warnings==
*When handling hot chilis, use gloves or take extra care to keep your hands away from eyes and other sensitive areas ''even after washing them''.

Many commercial vegetarian ground beef replacements are sold. They all probably taste better than this recipe, but this one has the advantage of customization, and is also (nearly?) gluten-free. You always know exactly what goes into what you cook yourself.

==Ingredients==
*2 [[Cookbook:tablespoon|tablespoon]]s wheat-free low-sodium [[Cookbook:tamari|tamari]]&lt;ref name=&quot;tamari&quot;&gt;I find regular soy sauce or even tamari to be too salty in the end. Wheat-free is only needed if a gluten-free result is desired.&lt;/ref&gt;
*¼ [[Cookbook:teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:yeast extract|yeast extract]]&lt;ref name=&quot;yeast_extract&quot;&gt;Some vendors sell products containing a significant amount of yeast extract (such as rice cakes with yeast extract) as gluten-free; [http://www.gicare.com/pated/edtgs06.htm this source] recommends avoiding yeast extract as containing barley. If you want to avoid the yeast extract, you might try increasing the amount of mushroom powder and beet juice.&lt;/ref&gt;
*½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:beet|beet]] juice (for example, from canned beets)
*¼ powdered [[Cookbook:Mushroom#Shiitake|shiitake mushroom]] (see [[#Procedure|procedure]])
*¼ [[Cookbook:onion powder|onion powder]]
*4 [[Cookbook:ounce|ounce]]s (110g) extra-firm [[Cookbook:tofu|tofu]]

==Procedure==
All ingredient amounts are approximate.

Make mushroom powder by grinding dried shitake mushroom with a mortar and pestle until no large pieces remain (this takes some time, as the dried mushroom is slightly &quot;leathery&quot;). ¼ teaspoon is around a fifth of a small cap.

Make the [[Cookbook:marinade|marinade]] by mixing together all the seasonings in a small mixing bowl, making sure the mushroom powder and yeast extract is evenly incorporated with no lumps. Drain the tofu, pressing it to get rid of as much moisture as possible. Combine with tofu, crushing the tofu into small pieces and allowing to absorb the liquid evenly. I find that placing the tofu in a zip-top bag, pouring the marinade over it, sealing it, and then crushing the tofu with the fingers works well. You want no pieces of tofu larger than a fingernail.

Allow sufficient time for the marinade to soak completely into the tofu, such as several hours or overnight.

Heat a medium non-stick skillet over medium heat. Using a small amount of [[Cookbook:Canola Oil|canola oil]]--just enough to coat the cooking surface--[[Cookbook:Sautéing|sautée]] the tofu, browning it to a golden color. Between the marinade and head, it will achieve a medium-brown, but won't achieve the deep brown of ground beef or commercial ground beef substitute.

Once the tofu is browned, it will still be quite soft. You can improve its texture by spreading it out in the hot pan and allowing it to cool for some time.

Store the ground tofu in the refrigerator. It can be reheated by heating it through in a skillet in whatever application you desire. It can be used as a filling for [[Cookbook:taco|taco]]s, [[Cookbook:Sloppy Joes|sloppy joes]], meat sauces for [[Cookbook:pasta|pasta]], and the like.

'''Tuna glop''' - A simple, quick-to-make meal

==Ingredients==
*2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (240 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:elbow macaroni|elbow macaroni]]
*1 can (10 oz, 300 g) cream of mushroom soup
*1 can (6 oz, 170 g) chunk [[Cookbook:tuna|tuna]] in water
*2 cups frozen vegetables, such as peas and carrots
*1 cup crushed potato chips

==Procedure==
# Prepare macaroni according to directions on the package, but without salt.  Drain and return to pot.
# Add cream of mushroom soup.
# Drain tuna and add.
# Add frozen vegetables and mix well.
# For crunchy vegetables, heat five minutes over low heat, stirring frequently.  Heat longer for softer vegetables.
# Serve topped with crushed potato chips.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
This is a recipe with a great deal of room for variation.  All the ingredients can be substituted: other small noodles for the macaroni, chopped turkey or chicken for tuna, cream of celery for cream of mushroom, or fresh chopped vegetables for frozen. I've even had it with corn flakes cereal substituted for the chips.

'''Kugel''' ([[:Category:Yiddish recipes|Yiddish]]: קוגל ''kugl'' or קוגעל, pronounced ''koo-gel'' or ''ki-gel'', also often referred to in the diminutive '''kugele''', '''kigele''') is any one of a wide variety of traditional baked [[Category:Jewish recipes|Jewish]] [[Cookbook:side dishes|side dishes]] or [[Cookbook:Dessert|desserts]]. It is sometimes translated as &quot;pudding&quot; or &quot;[[Cookbook:casserole|casserole]]&quot;.  

Kugels may be sweet or [[Wiktionary: savory#Adjective|savory]]. The most common types are made from [[Cookbook:egg|egg]] [[Cookbook:noodle|noodle]]s or [[Cookbook:potato|potatoes]] and often contain eggs, but there are recipes in everyday use in modern Jewish kitchens for a great diversity of kugels made with different vegetables, fruit, [[Cookbook:batter|batter]]s, cheese, and other flavorings and toppings. Kugel-making seems to be continually changing and evolving.

The following is a traditional potato kugel.

==Ingredients==
*8 large [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]
*2 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*½ cup (120ml) vegetable [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]
*5 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]], beaten
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]]
*1 teaspoon black pepper
*2½ tablespoons  [[Cookbook:sugar|sugar]]

==Procedure==
#Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).
#Peel potatoes, cut into chunks and place them in the food processor.  Process until smooth.
#Do the same for the onion.
#Mix potato and onion with egg, pepper, sugar, and salt.
#Heat oil in a 9 by 13 inch (23cm x 33cm) pan until it is quite hot.  Drop 1-2 tablespoons of the oil into the potato mixture, and mix.
#Pour the potato mixture into the pan.  Bake uncovered for 1 hour.

Makes 12-14 servings.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Replacing one or two of the the potatoes with a carrot gives the kugel a nice color and a distinct flavor.
*Some may prefer to decrease the amount of onion to one large onion.

'''Gravlax''' is [[Cookbook:Salmon|salmon]] that is cured in salt and sugar. It is a common dish throughout Scandinavia. Gravlax is easy to make and yet makes a festive dish that is an excellent to serve at parties with many people. The process of curing fish in salt and sugar (''grava'') is not limited to salmon, but works fine with any fat-fish. However, Salmon is definitely the most common choice. Gravlax has been particularly popular and common in the northern regions of Scandinavia who's cold and fresh waters produce salmon of excellent quality. The basic recipe here has been used for generations and has its origins in the northernmost part of Sweden. Gravlax can be used both as a main dish or as an appetizer.

== Ingredients ==
* 8 hg of fresh [[Cookbook:Salmon|salmon]] file
* 30 ml of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 30 ml of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 45 ml of [[Cookbook:Juniper Berry|juniper berries]]
* 30 cl of [[Cookbook:Gin|gin]] (optional)
* 5 ml of whole or crushed [[Cookbook:Pepper|white pepper]] seeds
* 20-40 g of [[Cookbook:Dill|dill]]

== Procedure ==
[[Image:Gravlax1.jpg|thumbnail|Thawed salmon with the required ingredients.]]
[[Image:Gravlax2.jpg|thumbnail|Apply salt and sugar.]]
[[Image:Gravlax3.jpg|thumbnail|Apply pepper and juniper berries.]]
[[Image:Gravlax4.jpg|thumbnail|Cover with dill.]]
[[Image:Gravlax5.jpg|thumbnail|Place one piece on top of the other.]]
[[Image:Gravlax6.jpg|thumbnail|Seal the salmon in a plastic bag and refrigerate.]]
[[Image:Gravlax7.jpg|thumbnail|Serve thin slices of the cured salmon.]]

Use the thick part (towards the head) of the Salmon file, it should be approximately 2-5 cm (about an inch) thick. Cut the file in two equally sized parts (if you are making gravlax for many people it is fine to use two files instead). Don't use the part closes to the tail, since it is not thick enough. Now freeze the salmon for at-least four days at -18C or colder to kill any parasites.

After deep freezing the salmon remove it from the fridge and let it thaw, preferably over night in the refrigerator. The salmon does not have to be completely thawed for the next step.

Place the salmon, skin down, on a table. Rub the salt and sugar mix onto the pieces, then apply the juniper berries and pepper. Finally cover with dill. 
Put one piece on top of another and place in a plastic bag. Toss any leftover &quot;ingredients&quot; into the bag along with the gin. Seal the bag and place it in the refrigerator. Now let the salmon cure in the mixture, turning the bag over once, preferably twice, a day; for four days.

After four days the salmon is ready to serve. If you are not going to eat it directly (it lasts a couple of days) move it to a fresh plastic bag or jar, removing the salty liquid that have formed in the original bag. If you keep it in the original bag the risk is that it may be too salty once you are about to serve it.

Use a sharp knife to slice thin slices from the salmon at an angle. During slicing also remove any leftover bones. The larger the piece of salmon the larger the angle and the larger surface area for the produced slices. Large slices looks better when served.

As a main dish, serve with [[Cookbook:Potato Stew|potato stew]], boiled potatoes and [[Cookbook:gravlax sause|gravlax sause]] or in a [[Cookbook:Salad|salad]]. As an appetizer serve on [[Cookbook:Crispbread|crispbread]] or [[Cookbook:Toast|toast]].

Potato stew with some additional [[Cookbook:Dijon Mustard|Dijon mustard]] is excellent addition to gravlax.

== Variations ==
The gin can be substituted for the acids in lemons or limes (like a ceviche).

A '''cruller''' is a type of doughnut. It is often covered in or topped with icing, which may be chocolate. It is often twisted (rather than round) in shape and unraised. The word comes from early 19th century Dutch ''kruller'', from ''krullen'' &quot;to curl.&quot;
It is most commonly found in New England and the Mid-Atlantic and North Central states of the USA, but it is also common in California. It is also common in France.

'''Gluten-Free Breakfast Waffles''' - These waffles are surprisingly good for a gluten-free recipe.  They are similar to the [[Cookbook:Breakfast Waffles|breakfast waffles made with wheat flour]] except the [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] is replaced with [[Cookbook:Wheat-Free Baking Mix|Wheat-Free Baking Mix]].  They are simple and predictable to make.  The batter can be made in about 15 minutes, so they are suitable as a last-minute addition to a breakfast.  They are made fluffy by beating the egg whites separately and folding them in as the last step.

The amount of milk is taylored to  [http://www.bobsredmill.com/catalog/index.php?action=showdetails&amp;product_ID=405|&quot;Bob's Red Mill Wheat Free Biscuit &amp; Baking Mix&quot;] which is a blend of non-wheat flours and some gluten-free binders.  You could use any [[Cookbook:Wheat-Free Baking Mix|Wheat-Free Baking Mix]] provided it is actually gluten-free (and not just wheat-free), but you might have to adjust the amount of milk to get the right consistency.

==Ingredients==
*3 [[Cookbook:Eggs|eggs]], separated
*1 3/4 cups (420ml) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*1/2 lb (225g) [[Cookbook:Wheat-Free Baking Mix|Wheat-Free Baking Mix]]
*2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
*3 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1/2 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*4 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Vegetable Oil|vegetable oil]]

==Procedure==
#[[Cookbook:Mix|Mix]] egg yolks and milk. 
#Add the wheat-free baking mix, baking powder, sugar, salt and [[Cookbook:Mix Well|mix well]]. 
#Add the oil. 
#[[Cookbook:Beat|Beat]] the egg whites until stiff and then [[Cookbook:Fold|fold]] into the batter.

{{recipe}} | [[Category:Cookie recipes|Cookies]]
A '''snickerdoodle''' is a soft [[Cookbook:sugar cookie|sugar cookie]] lightly dusted with [[Cookbook:cinnamon|cinnamon]]. It has a characteristically crackly surface, and can be crisp or soft, depending on preference.  
Some variants include nutmeg, raisins, or nuts.  Snickerdoodles are a traditional Christmas cookie in North America.

==Origins==
''The Joy of Cooking'' claims that snickerdoodles are probably German in origin, and that the name is a corruption of the German word for &quot;slug noodles&quot; (''schneckennudeln'').

==Historical Recipes==
  
From the Boston Globe, June 14, 1898, pg. 8:
:''Snickerdoodles''

:Three quarters of a cup of butter, 2 cups of sugar, 1 cup of milk, 3 cups of flour, 2 eggs, 2 teaspoons of cream of tartar, 1 teaspoon of soda. Mix; drop on a tin in spoonfuls, sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon, and bake in quick oven.

From the Idaho Daily Statesman (Boise, Idaho), October 20, 1901, pg. 11:
:&quot;Snickerdoodles&quot; is the somewhat fantastic name of quickly made little cakes especially dear to the children's heart. A recipe for them copied from an old scrapbook says: &quot;Stir together two cups of sugar and half a cup of butter. When creamy, add two well-beaten eggs, then one cup of milk, with a teaspoonful of soda, dissolved in it; and, lastly, add two and a half cups of flour, with two teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar and half a spoonful of salt. Beat the batter thoroughly, and bake in shallow pans, dusting the top of the cake before baking with cinnamon and sugar. Bake fifteen minutes, and when cool cut in squares. This receipt will make two panfuls, which will cut into twenty-four squares.&quot;

== Ingredients ==

One recipe for the production of snickerdoodle cookies is as follows:

* 2 3/4 cups (650ml) all-purpose flour
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 2 teaspoons cream of tartar
* 1 1/2 cups (360ml) white sugar
* 1 cup (240ml) soft shortening
* 2 eggs, beaten

== Procedure ==

Heat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (205 degrees Celsius), mix ingredients, and bake for 10 minutes or until crisp and light brown.  Sprinkle generously with cinnamon while hot.

An alternative recipe uses only 1 cup (240ml) sugar and replaces 1/2 cup (120ml) of the shortening with butter. 
After those ingredients are mixed, the dough is rolled into 1 tablespoon balls and then rolled in a mixture of 2 tablespoons sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. They are baked as noted above.  Other recipes add honey to the dough, which helps to keep the cookies from becoming too crisp.

==Popular Culture==

Snickerdoodles have become something of a catchphrase among Veronica Mars fans, since one episode features Veronica secretly baking the cookies for her best friend Wallace.

'''Ginger beer''' is a traditional fermented drink that can be made as either a soft drink or an alcoholic drink. Make it with more sugar or [[Cookbook:Malt extract|malt extract]], and with longer fermentation time, for alcoholic ginger beer.

==Ingredients==

* 100-300 [[Cookbook:Gram|grams]] ginger root, peeled and grated
* 1 whole [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]], [[Cookbook:Zest|zested]] and [[Cookbook:Juice|juiced]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tsp|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Cream of Tartar|cream of tartar]]
* 500 grams [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* [[Cookbook:Water|water]] to 10 [[Cookbook:L|litres]]
* fermentation starter (see note)

==Preparation==

# Simmer the ginger, lemon zest and sugar in about 1.5L water for about 10 minutes
# If using yeast as the fermentation starter, rehydrate the yeast in a glass of warm water for 5 minutes
# Add the lemon juice, cream of tartar and water to the fermenter (see note)
# Let the mixture sit in a closed container until it has started bubbling well, which should take for 8-12 hours with yeast, or longer with kefir grains
# Bottle into PET bottles or other soft plastic food-safe bottles
# When the bottles are hard (not just firm), whack them into the fridge and drink when cool.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
* Fermentation starter: use [[Cookbook:Kefir|kefir grains]] or [[w:Tibicos|tibicos]] or [[w:Ginger beer|ginger beer plant]] or ale yeast or [[Cookbook:Yeast|bread yeast]]
* Fermenter: I use an old PET water bottle, but a food-grade bucket will do, or a large stainless-steel pot; don't use copper or aluminium
* The water used should be free of chlorine if possible - e.g. boiled and cooled, or filtered, or bottled spring water. This is because chlorine (or chloramine) will inhibit the fermentation a little. Use what you've got, but best results will be obtained without the chlorine.
* Once the ginger beer is fermenting, as evidenced by lots of tiny bubbles rising to the surface, it can be used as a [[Cookbook:Leavening agent|leavening agent]]. Simply replace the water and yeast in a [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] recipe with ginger beer, and leave to rise as normal.

This is a variety of dal, the common staple food of South Asia made with [[Cookbook:Dal|dal]] forming a stew or thick soup. Dal is the name for split [[Cookbook:Legume|legumes]] in many South Asian languages (see [[Cookbook:Dal|dal]] article). Khatti translates as sour from Hindi, and comes from the use of tamarind, a very sour fruit on its own. Serve with any variety of [[Cookbook:Roti|roti]] (a round flat bread) or over rice and with a vegetable preparation on the side and an achar (pickle) or chutney as condiments. The roti is used to scoop up the dal and grab pieces of the vegetable.

==Ingredients==

*[[Cookbook:Toor dal|Toor daal]] (split pigeon peas) -  1 cup (240ml)
*[[Cookbook:Oil|Oil]] -  2 tblsp
*[[Cookbook:Onion|Onion]]  -  1
*[[Cookbook:Ginger|Ginger paste]]  - 1/2 tsp
*[[Cookbook:Garlic|Garlic paste]] - 1 tsp
*[[Cookbook:Tomato|Tomato]] (diced or crushed) - 3 tblsp
*[[Cookbook:Tamarind|Tamarind]] -  6-8 pieces (not paste)
*[[Cookbook:Chili Powder|Red chilli powder]] -  1 tsp
*[[Cookbook:Turmeric|Turmeric]]  -  1/2 tsp
*[[Cookbook:Mustard|Mustard seeds]] - 1 tsp
*[[Cookbook:Cumin|Cumin seeds]] (jeera) -  1 tsp
*[[Cookbook:Curry Leaf|Curry leaves]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] to taste
*[[Cookbook:Cilantro|Coriander leaves]] (cilantro) for garnish

==Procedure==

# Wash toor daal and boil it about 20 minutes until soft then smash it.
# In a kadai (rounded all purpose cooking bowl/frying pan), heat the oil till hot.  Add curry leaves, mustard seeds and jeera seeds.  Fry for a minute. They will pop at first, so a cover will help to avoid a mess.
# Add onion and fry till slightly brown. 
# Add ginger and garlic paste.  Fry for a minute.  Then add the tomatoes (paste or diced). Cook it till the oil separates.
# Add tamarind pieces (not paste).  Add turmeric powder and red chilli powder. Cook it for 4 to 5 mins.
# Add the toor daal and enough water per the thickness desired.
# Add salt to taste and garnish with coriander leaves.
# Serve with a roti (flat bread) or poured over rice.

'''Pashofa''' - A Chickasaw main dish which is still eaten. Hogs are not native to the Americas, but escaped and became feral from De Soto's expedition.

==Ingredients==
*900g (2 pounds) of Pashofa (hominy) corn
*5kg (1lb) cubed [[Cookbook:Pork|Pork]] chops

==Procedure==
# Rinse the corn a number of times; pick out floating hulls. 
# Put rinsed corn into a nice, large pot and put water (7.5cm - 10cm) 3-4 inches over. 
# Bring corn to a boil and put the pork into the pot. 
# Turn stove down to medium-low and simmer for two to three hours. Stir occasionally to avoid scorching. You may have to add water as it boils away. 

==Notes, tips, and variations==
Some people like it thick like stew; some people like it thin like soup with lots of juice. Bacon with grease are sometimes used instead of pork chops. This is an unsalty, bland dish if you just use pork chops. If you like salt and pepper, you will want to put it on after cooking.

'''Teurgoule''' is a cinnamon-flavoured rice pudding that is a speciality of Normandy. The name comes from the Norman language and means ''twist mouth'', a reference to the faces supposedly pulled by someone tasting it due to the spiciness of the dish.

Teurgoule even has a brotherhood, ''La Confrérie Gastronomique de la Teurgoule'' which is based in Houlgate and presides over the annual Teurgoule cooking competition. The presiding members wear the brotherhood's ceremonial robe which is green and orange with a cape. The brotherhood keeps the official recipe.

==Ingredients==
*200 g of semolina sugar 
*175 g of round grain rice 
*1 pinch of salt 
*1/4 spoonful of powdered cinnamon 
*2 L of whole milk (blue label) 

== Procedure ==
# Preheat your oven at 150°C (thermostat 2). 
# Mix the sugar, rice, salt and cinnamon in a terrine bowl. 
# Put the mix in the oven for 5 hours while making sure no one opens the oven door. 
# The rice must absorb approximately three-quarters of the milk and must be covered by a brown skin. 
# Let the pudding cool down and serve at room temperature.

==Tofu Scramble==

===Ingredients===
*1/3 block tofu, soft, drained 15 minutes
*1/2 small onion, diced 
*1 clove garlic, minced 
*1 sun dried tomato slice, diced, (usually come in packages sliced) 
*spinach, flat leaf, a small handful 
*red pepper 
*turmeric or curry (for a spicier dish)
*Mrs. Dash or some other flavored salt (optional) 
*olive or vegetable oil (or veggie butter) 
*salt and pepper
*flour tortillas, or vegan bread (1-3, optional)
 
===Directions===
Add about 1-2 tablespoon (15-30g) oil to sauce pan. Add onion, garlic and sun dried tomato to pan, cook until soft and golden. 

While that is cooking, mash tofu (I use my fingers) until they get an even scrambled texture and add spices. I never measure, so use your own judgment on the spices. 

I usually add 2 dashes red pepper, two dashes turmeric, salt the top of my mound twice and pepper it once, and add a pinch of flavored salt. Then mix it all in until evenly distributed. 

When onion mix is cooked, add tofu and spinach. Heat through (until spinach is soft and wilted looking) 

This makes 1-2 servings. I like it in a flour tortilla, like a breakfast burrito, or in vegan bread, like a breakfast sandwich, but eat as you like. I think it really tastes a lot like eggs. 

Enjoy! 

Serves: 1-2 

Preparation time: 15 mins.

==Alternate Version==

===Ingredients===
*1 green onion
*2 small cloves garlic
*2 strips Smart bacon or other breakfast meat substitute 
*1/2 large block of firm tofu
*couple dashes of turmeric 
*splash of liquid aminos 
*pinch of nutritional yeast flakes 
*oil (for the pan)

===Directions===
First, you've got to heat up the pan on medium- high heat with the oil to cook the bacon-but don't cook it too long or it will be overcooked once you're done. While you're cooking the bacon, start chopping up the garlic and green onion. press as much water from the tofu as possible, then use a cheese grater to grate the tofu into semi-small chunks. you could probably mash it a bit with a fork instead, but I find grating to be a lot quicker. After you have the tofu grated into a bowl, add the onion, garlic, bacon (cooked and cut into small pieces by this time), the turmeric and liquid aminos. You'll want to stir this up gently until you are satisfied that everything is well mixed. Put it in the pan (it should sizzle a bit) and sprinkle the nutritional yeast flakes over the top. Keep stirring occasionally for about 10 minutes or until you've got the desired look of scrambled &quot;eggs.&quot; 

I like to eat this with some hash browns, of course. This is very very tasty, if i do say so myself. Oh, and be careful with the turmeric. it stains everything yellow... 


Serves: 2 

Preparation time: about 20 min

'''Tomato Concassé''' (French ''tomates concassées'') is skinned, de-seeded, and diced tomato.

== Ingredients ==
*1 [[Cookbook:Pound|lb.]] (450g) [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]

== Procedure ==
# Boil a large pot of water and prepare a large bowl with ice water for refreshing the tomatoes. 
# Remove the stem and core of the tomatoes by cutting a cone shaped piece out of the stem-end of each tomato. Then score a large X (arms about 1 inch (2.5cm) long) centered on the other end of the tomato. 
# Place the tomatoes in the boiling water for about 30-45 seconds then immediately refresh in the ice water bath. 
# Once cool, peel the skin off the tomatoes. Then slice the tomatoes in half around the circumference, not through the stem.&lt;ref&gt;[[w:en:Mastering the Art of French Cooking|''Mastering the Art of French Cooking.'' by Julia Child ''et al''.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Squeeze  out the juice and seeds, scraping with a spoon. 
# Lay the tomato carcasses flat on a cutting board and dice into ⅜ inch (0.75cm) pieces.&lt;ref&gt; ''If you don't care that much, you can skip the skinning and seeding part and just chop the tomatoes into ⅜-inch pieces, but that's not really tomato concassé, just diced tomatoes.''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ingredients: ==

* Onions
* Garlic
* Sugar
* Tomatoes, chopped

== Procedure: ==

#Fry onions in olive oil to transparent.  Ensure that the onions don't burn.
#Add lots of chopped garlic.  Again, ensure they don't burn.
#Add a large amount of sugar. Don't caramelise.
#Chop tomatoes and remove any hard parts.
#Add tomatoes to onions and garlic, excess olive oil. 
#Simmer for approximately 4 hours. Lose as much water as possible. (This order isn't logical as the oil prevents evaporation. It would be interesting to simmer and then add the oil at the end, but I've never tried that. )
#Add Salt, pepper, herbes de Provence. Also add Vinegar if you feel like it, but not much.
#Should keep even without refrigeration if you've lost enough water. Traditionally you keep it in unsealed jars and just scoop and throw away any mould on the surface.

A food that is popular in Italy and the Northeast USA, '''Tomato Pie''' is a type of [[Cookbook:Pizza|Pizza]]. Sometimes mistakingly considered an American dish, it is commonly found in bakeries throughout Italy and other countries, where it is simply called [[Cookbook:Pizza|Pizza]] and is often bought and consumed on the spot.

'''Tomato Pie''' is generally made with canned tomatoes. In the USA, it is usually served at room temperature, however many bakeries, where it is often bought as fast food, will reheat slices upon request.

Many bakeries and pizzerias have their own variation on the basic recipe.

The basic recipe features thick pizza dough covered with a thick tomato sauce. After cooking the pizza is sprinkled with grated romano cheese.

==Ingredients==
* 3 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Olive oil|extra-virgin olive oil]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Clove|cloves]] [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* 1 large can [[Cookbook:Tomato|crushed tomatoes]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] dried [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] 
* 1 [[Cookbook:Pound|pound]] (450g)[[Cookbook:Pizza dough|pizza dough]]
* 3 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] grated Pecorino Romano cheese

== Procedure ==
#Preheat oven to [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|250C]] (450°F). 
#Stretch the pizza dough to cover a greased baking sheet. Dough should be about 3cm (3/4&quot;) thick. 
#Allow the dough to rise while the sauce is prepared.
#Heat a saucepan on medium heat, add the olive oil and garlic. 
#[[Cookbook:Saute|Saute]] until garlic is just golden. 
#Add crushed tomatoes and oregano.
#Cook until the sauce is thickened, about 15-20 minutes. 
#Cool the sauce until it is room temperature. 
#Top the pizza dough with the sauce, bake in the oven for about 15-20 minutes.
#After removing the tomato-pie from the oven, sprinkle the cheese on top and then let the pizza cool to room temperature.

Serve at room temperature or reheat under the broiler or in a toaster-oven.

A '''tortilla española''', or Spanish omelette, is a mixture of fried potatoes and onions set in eggs, fried to make a dish somewhat akin to a [[Cookbook:Quiche|quiche]] which may be eaten like a [[Cookbook:Pizza|pizza]].

The following recipe makes a ten inch (25cm) omelette that will feed from one to four persons.

==Ingredients==

* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbsp]] minced garlic
* Vegetable or olive oil
* 6 medium potatoes
* 1 white onion
* 6 large eggs

==Procedure==

# Heat the garlic and a small amount of oil in a ten inch frying pan until garlic is browned.
# Add the rest of the oil and heat to about 375 degrees Fahrenheit (200c).
# Cube or slice the potatoes and coarsely chop the onion; add to hot oil and fry until brown.
# Strain the potatoes, onions, and garlic and reserve about two tablespoons of oil.
# Beat eggs in a separate bowl.
# Add potatoes, onions, and garlic to beaten eggs and allow to sit for about 15 minutes.
# Put reserved tablespoons of oil in original ten inch frying pan and place over low-medium heat.
# Add egg/potato/onion/garlic mixture to frying pan; fry, lifting up edges of tortilla española to allow uncooked egg to run underneath and cook.
# Serve after cooked as a pizza with your choice of toppings: salsa, sour cream, shredded cheese, chives, etc., are all very good choices.

'''Toum''' - a garlic sauce as prepared in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Lebanon|Lebanon]].

== Ingredients ==
* [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* [[Cookbook:Olive oil|Olive Oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

Quantities as much as needed.

== Procedure ==
The garlic cloves are smashed using a wooden pestle, mixed with salt. Salt could be added just at the beginning or after the garlic cloves are well smashed. When the garlic becomes very smooth, olive oil is added gradually and mixed. The mixing is done by stirring the whole in the pestle. One should keep stirring until the whole is very viscous. The olive oil will be sucked by the garlic. Oil is added again, and again stirring until oil disappears. Little by little oil is added and stirred and this way the volume of the sauce grows and its taste gets sweeter. At a certain point lemon juice is added and mixed again until you get the sauce you see in the picture.

[[Image:Jern Toum.jpg|right|thumb|wooden mortar used to prepare Toum]]
One thing to pay attention to, is not to add too much oil on one single time. Oil should be added gradually. The sauce should stick together and stay as viscous as possible. At a certain point one may notice that it's impossible to add more oil without the sauce falling apart. At that moment one can add a little lemon juice, stir for a while, and then continue adding oil and stirring. This makes the sauce stick together.

Do not stop for a long period time between mixing the Oil and the Lemon. While adding the oil it is necessary to keep stirring, stopping only for very brief periods.

The pestle used to prepare the Toum is usually wooden, some new one are made out of synthetic materials, like plastic; occasionally it is carved in stone. Stone carved pestles are usually used for [[w:Kibbeh nayyeh|Kebbeh Nayyeh]].

The method described above is the most genuine way, this is how it's done in most parts of Lebanon.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}}

== Ingredients ==
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 1 large onion, finely chopped
* 3lbs (1.5 kilo) Minced beef
* 4 cloves of garlic, finely chopped or crushed
* 1 can (400g) quality chopped plum tomatoes
* 10-15 basil leaves, chopped or torn (or 1 tsp dried basil)
* 1/2 tsp dried oregano
* 5 crushed black peppercorns (or to taste)
* 1 tsp sea salt (or to taste)
* 1/2 tsp sugar
* (Optionally) 150-200ml red wine
* One pack of lasagne sheets

* 1.5 pints [[Cookbook:Bechemel Sauce|Bechemel Sauce]]

* Finely grated parmesan

== Equipment ==
* One small pan for the bechemel sauce (preferably non-stick)
* One large, deep pan for the ragu
* A shallow oven-proof dish

== Procedure ==

# Heat the olive oil in a heavy base or non-stick pan over a medium-high heat. If the oil browns, turn the heat down.
# Add the onion and fry until golden brown
# Increase heat to high and add the meat and garlic. Fry until brown. Minced/ground beef takes some time to cook well. Fry until there is little moisture left in the pan. If necessary, spoon out any excess fat.
# Add the tomatoes and sugar, cover the pan and lower the heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the bechemel sauce.
# Pre-heat the oven to 375f/190c
# Mix the basil, oregano, salt &amp; pepper in to the ragu
# Place a thin layer of ragu in the base of the ovenproof dish and cover with a single layer of pasta sheets. Spread a layer of bechemel sauce over the pasta. Repeat this until you run out of meat, making sure that you have enough bechemel sauce left to cover the top layer of pasta.
# Sprinkle the grated parmesan over the top.
# Place the dish in the oven on the top shelf and cook for about 45 minutes, or until the top is lightly browned and the sauce is bubbling.

== Hints &amp; tips ==
* Get good beef. This is the most important part of the dish. The best beef will produce little fat and a great flavour.
* Try using goats cheese and milk for the bechemel sauce. Sainsbury's and Safeways both sell a goat's cheese that's almost like cheddar in consistency. Perfect for bechemel sauce.
* Look for canned tomatoes in 'rich tomato juice'. They're a bit more expensive, but definitely worthwhile
* Fresh basil and pepper are a must.
* Try it with minced lamb

This is the '''traditional pie crust'''. To ensure a flakey crust (considered desirable), you need to use [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]] and you need to keep the lard from melting. It's best to use a cold stone [[Cookbook:Rolling Pin|rolling pin]] and surface, and to generally keep everything in the refrigerator until used.

==Ingredients==
*[[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*[[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*[[Cookbook:Lard|lard]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

==Procedure==
Sift a pound and a half (775g) of flour, and take out a quarter for rolling cut in it a quarter of a pound of lard (110g), mixed with water and roll it out; cut half a pound (110g) of butter, and put it in at two rollings with the flour that was left out.

For making the bottom crust of pies, put half a pound (110g) of lard into a pound of flour, with a little salt, mix it stiff, and grease the plates before you make pies; always make your paste in a cold place and bake it soon. Some persons prefer mixing crust with milk instead of water.

Trifle is also commonly known as sherry trifle.  This is a traditional dessert in many countries and can be prepared with or without alcohol.  The non-alcohol version is popular with children.

== Ingredients ==
* 1 [[wikipedia:Swiss roll|swiss roll]] or similar sponge cake
* 50 to 100ml dry Sherry
* 1 packet/sachet Fruit flavoured jelly (or &quot;Quick-Jel&quot;)
* A tin of peach segments
* Custard
* Whipped double cream
* ''Hundreds and thousands'' or other sweet topping (optional)

== Procedure == 
# Slice the swiss roll approximately 3/4&quot; (2cm) thick, and line the base of a Pyrex casserole dish with it.
# Pour a small glass of sherry (approx 50 to 100ml) over the swiss roll.
# Drain the peaches, keeping the juice/syrup aside and then arrange the peaches over the swiss roll.
# Prepare the jelly as per the instructions, you may wish to use the syrup from the peaches for this. Pour the jelly into the casserole dish and allow to set in the fridge. &quot;Quick-Jel&quot; may be preferable due to time taken to set.
# Make the custard, again as per the instructions (use fresh or powdered as opposed to canned). Allow this to cool to lukewarm, and pour into the casserole. Allow this to set in the fridge.
# Whip the cream for the top of the trifle and spread it over the custard. Garnish with ''hundreds and thousands''/vermicelli or other cake decorations.

Serve!

'''Turkish Delight''', or '''lokum''' (also loukoum), is a confection made from starch and sugar. It is often flavored with rosewater or lemon, the former giving it a characteristic pale pink color. It has a soft, sticky consistency, and is often packaged and eaten in small cubes that are dusted with sugar to prevent sticking. Some recipes include small nut pieces, usually pistachio, hazelnut or walnuts.
== Ingredients ==
* 2 [[Cookbook:cup|cups]]  [[Cookbook:sugar|sugar]]
* 0.5 [[Cookbook:cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:cornstarch|cornstarch]]
* 1.5 [[Cookbook:cup|cups]] water
* 0.5 [[Cookbook:teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Cream of Tartar|cream of tartar]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:tablespoon|tbls]] [[Cookbook:rosewater|rosewater]] or one of the following to taste:
** 0.5 [[Cookbook:teaspoon|tsp]] rose food flavoring
** 0.25 [[Cookbook:cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:fruit juice|fruit juice]]
** 1 [[Cookbook:tablespoon|tbl]] [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla extract]]
** 1 [[Cookbook:tablespoon|tbl]] orange extract
** 1 [[Cookbook:tablespoon|tbl]] [[Cookbook:Crème de menthe|Crème de menthe]] liqueur
* Food coloring
* 0.5 [[Cookbook:cup|cup]] chopped toasted [[Cookbook:pistachio|pistachios]] or [[Cookbook:almond|almonds]] 
* [[Cookbook:icing sugar|icing sugar]], granulated sugar, or [[Cookbook:coconut|desiccated coconut]] for dusting

==Procedure==
#Combine sugar, 1 cu water, cream of tartar, and flavoring(s) in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. 
#Boil over medium-low heat for 20-30 minutes, until the mixture reaches &quot;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candy#Sugar_stages firm-ball],&quot; or 250°F ''(120°C)'' on a candy thermometer.
#In a separate bowl, combine cornstarch with remaining water, mix completely, and slowly stir into sugar mixture. Stir constantly until mixture is evenly combined.
#Apply non-stick cooking spray to a form (ice cube trays will do nicely, though not plastic ones), shallow pie pan, or jelly-roll pan.
#Pour the hot mixture into the pan or form and allow to set. 
#When cool, release from form or cut into cubes as applicable and roll each piece in powdered sugar, granulated sugar, or coconut.
#Store at room temperature in airtight container.

==Notes, tips and variations==
Note: with the exception of the sugar, cornstarch, water, cream of tartar, and cooking technique, this recipe may be greatly altered according to taste and/or occasion. The nuts may be omitted, and various flavorings can be added.

==Ingredients==
*2 cups (480ml) long-grain rice, cooked 
*2-1/2 teaspoons salt 
*1 medium eggplant, peeled and chopped into 1/2-inch (1cm) cubes 
*vegetable oil 
*2 tablespoons whole coriander seeds 
*2 teaspoons yellow split peas 
*1/8 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Cayenne pepper|cayenne pepper]] 
*1 3/4-inch (4cm) stick of [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]] 
*3 tablespoons dried unsweetened [[Cookbook:Coconut|coconut]] 
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Lemon juice|lemon juice]] 
*1/4 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]]

==Preparation==

This great Indian dish should be served at room temperature. It's not hot, but it is spicy. 

# Place the eggplant into a large bowl and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt. Mix well and allow to sit for half an hour. 
# Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a skillet over a medium flame. Add the coriander, seeds, split peas, cumin, and cinnamon. Stir well. When the spices have darkened, remove them and place on a plate lined with a paper towel. 
# In the same pan, fry the coconut, stirring constantly. When it turns a golden-brown, remove and place on the paper towel. 
# In another skillet, saute the eggplant until it is cooked through. It should turn a bruised dark brown. Be careful not to add too much oil in the process. Remove, set aside, and keep warm. 
# Put the dried spices into a mortar and grind into a fine powder. You'll find that a well-cleaned coffee grinder works well as a substitute. 
# In a small pot, combine the lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon salt, turmeric, and 2 tablespoons water. Bring to a boil. Lower the heat and allow to simmer for 3 minutes. 
# In a skillet, add the cooked rice and the eggplant and saute with very little oil. Mix well. Allow the mixture to cool. Add 2 more tablespoons of vegetable oil; mix well. Add the coconut-spice mixture and the lemon mixture. Mix well and serve.

'''Vareniki''' (singular ''varenik''; in [[w:Russian language|Russian]], ''&amp;#1074;&amp;#1072;&amp;#1088;&amp;#1077;&amp;#769;&amp;#1085;&amp;#1080;&amp;#1082;[&amp;#1080;]'') are a national [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Russia|Russian]] dish, somewhat similar to [[Cookbook:Pierogi|pierogi]], [[Cookbook:Pelmeni|pelmeni]] and [[Cookbook:Ravioli|ravioli]].  Vareniki, however, are of larger size and frequently have [[Cookbook:Cottage cheese|cottage cheese]] filling. Other typical fillings include mashed [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]]es, [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]], or [[Cookbook:Berry|berries]].

During preparation, the filling is wrapped with dough, and then boiled for several minutes.  The name ''varenik,'' in fact, simply means &quot;boiled thing&quot;, from the adjective ''&amp;#1074;&amp;#1072;&amp;#1088;&amp;#1105;&amp;#1085;&amp;#1099;&amp;#1081;'' (romanized, ''varënyj'').

Vareniki are very popular in Russia as a quick-fix dish.

'''Tyropita''' (Pronounced:: tee-''ro''-pee-ta) is a [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Greece|Greek]] layered pastry appetizer, made with layers of buttered filo dough, stuffed with cheese and usually shaped like a triangle. It is sold in bakeries throughout Greece, where it is a very popular breakfast and snack.

An alternative to tyropita is [[Cookbook:Spanakopita|spanakopita]], a pie with spinach.

== Ingredients ==
*1 1/2 pounds (675g) Feta Cheese
*5 Tablespoons Butter
*8 Tablespoons flour
*2 cups (480ml) scalded milk
*7 Eggs lightly beaten
*3/4 pound (330g) phyllo pastry
*Butter for brushing pastry
*Salt and Pepper to taste
 
== Procedure ==
Crumble cheese into very small pcs. Melt butter in small pot. Add flour, blend well. Slowly add scalded milk, stirring constantly to make a smooth bechamel sauce. Add a little salt &amp; pepper. Remove from heat and stir until cool. Add crumbled cheese and mix well. Add eggs and mix again.

Butter a pan abt. 2 inches (5cm) smaller than the phyllo sheets. Use a little more than hale of the phyllo sheets to make the bottom layer of the pie. Brush each with melted butter and place it in the pan letting the edges hang over the pan. Pour in the cheese-egg mixture, spreading evenly. Cover mixture with the phyllo that extended beyond pan. This will prevent mixture from leaking out. Carefully cut remaining phyllo to fit pan. Brush each sheet with butter before placing on pita. Brush top with butter and sprinkle with a little water. Score into strips to make cutting the pie easier after it is baked. 

Bake in a preheated 300 F. (150c) oven for 45 min. Cut into pcs. and serve hot.

'''Upma''' or '''Uppittu''' as it is referred to in [[w:Karnataka|Karnataka]] is a wholesome [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] dish made of [[Cookbook:Rava|Rava]] (Cream of Wheat). There are many ways it is prepared but typically includes a healthy amount of vegetables added during preparation. The Rava used for this must be the large-grained, as Upma prepared with fine Rava tends to become soggy.

== Ingredients: ==

*One cup upma rava (common in India and also found in Indian stores in other countries)
*One medium sized onion, finely chopped (more onions may also be added to give extra flavour)
*One medium sized tomato, chopped
*4 to 5 finely chopped green chilli peppers
*1 tsp ginger, finely chopped
*1 tsp garlic, finely chopped
*1 tsp mustard seeds
*4 tbsp. oil
*Salt (to taste)
*1 tbsp. lemon juice
*Two cups water
*Note: You can add other vegetables like potato, Zucchini, Mushroom, peas, beans etc. to suit your taste

== Procedure: ==

#In a [[Cookbook:Wok|wok]] or other suitable utensil heat 1 TBS of oil. When the oil is hot add the Rava in and stir it with a spoon until the Rava starts browning. The main purpose of this is to coat the rava grains with the oil so that they don’t stick. Be sure not to burn the Rava or you will have to restart. Keep the Rava aside and let it cool.
#In the same Wok or another suitable utensil heat the remaining oil. When hot add the Mustard seeds and wait until the seeds start crackling. When the crackling starts tapering off add the onions and fry until golden brown. Then add the ginger and the garlic and stir for a few seconds. Add the remaining vegetables and the water. Add enough salt such that when tasted it is slightly saltier than required. Turn the heat to medium and let it simmer until the vegetables are cooked but still crispy. 
#At this time turn the heat to low and start adding the Rava to the water. This is the most important step that determines the correct consistency of the Upma. The Rava must be added as quickly as possible while continuously stirring the contents ensuring no lumps are formed. When the Rava is thoroughly mixed cover the vessel and let it cook for a few minutes, stirring the contends every 20 seconds or so. 
#Turn the heat off and add the lemon juice and mix it well.
#Upma is known to be eaten with a variety of sides like Chutney, Sugar, Pickles etc.

'''Turtle soup''' is a [[Cookbook:soup|soup]] made from the flesh of the [[Cookbook:turtle|turtle]], often the [[Cookbook:green turtle|green turtle]] or, especially in the [[Cookbook:cuisine of the United States|United States]], the [[Cookbook:snapping turtle|snapping turtle]], in which case it is commonly referred to as ''snapper soup'' (not to be confused with ''red snapper soup'', which is made from the fish called a [[Cookbook:red snapper|red snapper]]).

This recipe is from ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/13923 The White House Cook Book]'', by Mrs. F.L. Gillette and Hugo Ziemann, 1887: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''GREEN TURTLE SOUP.'''&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One turtle, two onions, a bunch of sweet herbs, juice of one lemon, five quarts of water, a glass of Madeira.

&lt;p&gt;After removing the entrails, cut up the coarser parts of the turtle meat and bones. Add four quarts of water, and stew four hours with the herbs, onions, pepper and salt. Stew very slowly, do not let it cease boiling during this time. At the end of four hours strain the soup, and add the finer parts of the turtle and the green fat, which has been simmered one hour in two quarts of water. Thicken with brown flour; return to the soup-pot, and simmer gently for an hour longer. If there are eggs in the turtle, boil them in a separate vessel for four hours, and throw into the soup before taking up. If not, put in force meat balls; then the juice of the lemon, and the wine; beat up at once and pour out.

&lt;p&gt;Some cooks add the finer meat before straining, boiling all together five hours; then strain, thicken and put in the green fat, cut into lumps an inch long. This makes a handsomer soup than if the meat is left in.

&lt;p&gt;Green turtle can now be purchased preserved in air-tight cans.

&lt;p&gt;Force Meat Balls for the Above.—Six tablespoonfuls of turtle meat chopped very fine. Rub to a paste, with the yolk of two hard-boiled eggs, a tablespoonful of butter, and, if convenient, a little oyster liquor. Season with cayenne, mace, half a teaspoonful of white sugar and a pinch of salt. Bind all with a well-beaten egg; shape into small balls; dip in egg, then powdered cracker; fry in butter, and drop into the soup when it is served.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Trivia==
Turtle Soup was President William Howard Taft's favorite food.  He brought a special chef into the White House for the specific purpose of preparing this dish.

'''Vorschmack''' has long traditions in Finnish cuisine. Vorschmack can be served as an everyday meal, as well as a festive speciality. To be served heated, with pickled beetroot in vinegar, pickled cucumber and sour cream.

The Savoy restaurant is located on the top floor of Södra Esplanaden 14 in Helsingfors. The restaurant has traditions that go back generations. One of the frequented guests in the 1920’s and 1930’s was [[w:Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim|Marshal Mannerheim]]. Mannerheim’s table at the Savoy was always reserved, and out of respect no one would ever consider demanding to be seated there. Vorschmack was one of Mannerheim’s favorite appetizers.

==Ingredients==

* 4 lbs. (1800g) boned leg of [[Cookbook:Lamb|lamb]]
* ½ lbs. (225g) of boned [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]
* six [[Cookbook:Herring|herring fillets]] in [[Cookbook:Brining|salt brine]]
* one can of [[Cookbook:Anchovy|anchovy]], about 2 ounces (60g)
* 5 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]]
* [[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomato paste]]
* five [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] cloves
* [[Cookbook:Water|water]]

==Procedure==

# Let the herring fillets soak in 1 G cold water over night. Dry the fillets on paper towels. Preheat the oven to 400°F (220°C). Cut the meat in 1&quot; (2.5cm) cubes. Slice the onions. Arrange the meat and onion in a greased baking dish and roast on the medium shelf until golden brown (about 15-20 minutes).
# Let the dish cool, and then grind the contents with the herring and anchovy using a meat grinder. In a large bowl, add some water to the mixture to give it the consistency of thick porridge. Season with white pepper and pressed garlic.
# Place the contents in a baking dish. Spread out some tomato paste over the surface of the mixture. Bake at 350°F (175°C) for two hours. Add water if the Vorschmack looks dry. If the consistency is too light, continue baking to evaporate excess water. The consistency should resemble thick hot porridge.
# Serve hot with baked potatoes, smetana and a shot of ice cold vodka, filled to the rim. The saltiness of the Vorschmack is regulated by the time used to soak the herring fillets. For high saltiness, let the herring soak two hours, for low saltiness let them soak eight hours.

A mixture of several other flours that, along with the addition of xanthan gum or guar gum, approximates [[Cookbook:Flour#Wheat Flour|wheat flour]].

==Ingredients==
* 1 part [[Cookbook:Rice Flour|white rice flour]]
* 1 part [[Cookbook:Rice Flour|brown rice flour]]
* 1 part [[Cookbook:Tapioca Starch|tapioca starch]]
* ½ part [[Cookbook:Amaranth Flour|amaranth flour]]

==Notes, tips and variations==
* Use the above mix to replace a given quantity of wheat flour. For example:
** for 350 grams wheat flour, &quot;1 part&quot; = 100 grams and &quot;½ part&quot; = 50 grams
** for 7 ounces wheat flour, &quot;1 part&quot; = 2 ounces and &quot;½ part&quot; = 1 ounce
* Add some vegetable gum (e.g. [[Cookbook:Xanthan gum|xanthan gum]], [[Cookbook:Guar gum|guar gum]]) to make the four mix stiff enough for bread dough, if you need to form it into a shape. [http://whatscookingamerica.net/Q-A/ZanthanGum.htm Bette Hagman] recommends the following quantities, per cup of wheat-free baking mix:
** 1 tsp for cakes (about 0.073 parts)
** 2 tsp for bread and pizza (about 0.146 parts)
** 1 tsp, or none, for biscuits and cookies

[[Image:Baati.jpg|200px|Baati with dal and shrikhand.]]

'''Baati''' is a hard, unleavened bread cooked in desert areas of Rajasthan, Malwa, and Gujarat in North [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]]. It is prized there for its exceptionally long life and high energy content, as well as the minimal quantity of water required in its preparation.

==Ingredients==
* 1 pound (450g) [[Cookbook:Wheat flour|wheat flour]]
* 1/2 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 3 tablespoons oil
* 1 1/2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Ghee|ghee]] (for serving)

==Procedure==
# Mix the flour and salt.
# Put about a cup of the mix in a small bowl and add a little oil, mixing it in well and breaking up any lumps.
# Pour in water about a tablespoon at a time and keep kneading with your hands. You only need three or four tablespoons, but you must knead the dough very hard to make it stick together in a ball. The more compact the dough, the better and denser the baati will be.
# Let the balls sit for 5 minutes.
# Flatten out each ball with first your hands and then a rolling pin until they are smooth discs 4 inches (10cm) across and 1/2 (1.25cm) inch thick.
# Cook in a dry metal pan on a low flame.
# Flip once when the bottom begins to harden, then pinch all over with two fingers so the dough is not too thick and has a bumpy texture on one side.
# Check the bottom until it browns in spots, then remove the baati and place it upside-down on a grate or pan with holes in it. This will blacken the top a little, especially on the tops of the pinched bumps.
# To serve, drizzle liberally with ghee and accompany with a dhal or vegetable.

Makes 4-6 Baati

==Notes, tips, and variations==
* Variation: Sprinkle [[Cookbook:Powdered sugar|powdered sugar]] on after the ghee for a sweet snack.

* Put halves of sandwich together.
* Cut in half and serve with milk
* Enjoy!

==Variations &amp; Tips==
* If the peanut butter is too sloppy, try spreading the honey thin on both slices of bread and omit the extra butter.
* Rasins may be added. They have a honey-like flavor, which will compliment the honey in the sandwich
* Bananas are traditional side items. They go well with peanut butter.
* These directions can be variated by preference.

==Warnings==
* Beware! The peanut butter mixture is sloppy.

'''Sauerkraut''' is a traditional [[Cookbook:Fermentation|fermented]] vegetable food made from cabbage. This is a basic recipe that produces a tangy sauerkraut with live bacteria that provide [[w:probiotic|probiotic]] goodness. No cooking is required.

==Ingredients==

* 1 large (2.5 [[Cookbook:Kg|kg]] - 5 lb) fresh [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]]
* 2-3 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Salt|non-iodised salt]]

==Preparation==

# Clean and dry a large (3 litre) preserves jar or crock, chopping board, and large bowls if needed
# [[Cookbook:Quarter|Quarter]] the cabbage and remove the core
# [[Cookbook:Slice|Slice]] the cabbage finely or thickly, as you prefer
# Optional: bruise the sliced cabbage by beating with a [[Cookbook:Rolling Pin|rolling pin]] or [[Cookbook:Mortar and Pestle|mortar and pestle]]
# Layer the cabbage in the jar or crock, sprinkling salt in between layers
# Pack tightly into the jar, leaving 1cm space at the top; don't seal the jar yet
# Juice should rise to top of jar as you tightly pack the cabbage in; if not, add a little [[Cookbook:Water|chlorine-free water]]

==Fermentation==

Don't seal the jar while it is fermenting, as it will build up gas pressure and might break the jar. Just cover with a cloth, or cling-wrap. Set the jar in a bowl or on a plate, so that any juice that might overflow will be collected and won't make a mess.

The sauerkraut will be fermented in about a week. Wipe any excess liquid from around the jar, and put the lid on tightly before moving it to a cool place (e.g. the refrigerator) to mature. It is ready to eat after the first week, but will improve with age and as the bacteria slowly consume the more complex sugars in the cabbage.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*The salt used should be non-iodised salt if possible - e.g. pickling salt, kosher salt. This is because the iodine in iodised table salt will inhibit the fermentation a little. Use what you've got, but best results will be obtained without the iodine.
*Add other vegetables, fruits, or spices for variations, e.g.
**[[Cookbook:Juniper Berry|juniper berries]]
**[[Cookbook:Pineapple|diced pineapple]]
**[[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
**[[Cookbook:Chili|chili]]
**[[Cookbook:Grater|grated]] [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]]
*The cabbage can be quickly sliced to a regular thickness by using a [[Cookbook:Mandoline|mandoline]]. Fingers can be sliced just as quickly...

'''Kefir''' is a fermented milk drink originating in the [[w:Caucasus|Caucasus]]. It is liquid, thicker than milk, sour, and a little yeasty. It can have small amounts of alcohol, but typically much less than &amp;frac12;% by volume. It is traditionally fermented using '''kefir grains''', a symbiotic culture of yeasts and bacteria passed down from generation to generation.

==Ingredients==

* 50 [[Cookbook:Gram|grams]] (1&amp;frac34; oz) of kefir grains (see note)
* 500 [[Cookbook:ML|ml]] (1 pint) fresh [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] (see note)

==Preparation==

# Remove kefir grains from previous batch of starter, using a [[Cookbook:Sieve|sieve]] or [[Cookbook:Colander|colander]].
# Shake kefir grains to remove excess kefir. Rinsing is not necessary (but optionally, rinse in fresh milk)
# Place kefir grains in glass jar or jug with fresh milk. Generally, keep a ratio of kefir grains to milk of about 1:10
# Set aside to ferment at room temperature for up to 24 hours (see note)

==Notes, tips, and variations==
[[Image:Kefirpilze.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Kefir grains]]
* Kefir grains are gelatinous lumps. You can often get them for free, or for the cost of postage - see link below. Once you've got some, they grow in the milk until you have enough to give to someone else.
* As an alternative to kefir grains, some health food shops carry a powdered kefir starter. This will never make kefir grains, but the powdered starter will make good kefir and is easier for some people to manage.
* Milk can be almost any milk from a mammal. Full cream cow's milk is best, but kefir can be made from low-fat milk, goat's milk, or sheep's milk.
* Non-milk kefir can be made from sugary water, fruit juice, coconut juice, rice milk, or soy milk. However, the kefir grains will stop growing in these liquids, so it is best to only use excess kefir grains or powdered kefir starter for this.
* In warm weather, kefir will ferment very quickly and can become separated into [[Cookbook:Curds|curds]] and [[Cookbook:Whey|whey]]. An easy way to prevent this is to start the new batch of kefir at night, when it's cooler, and put the fermenting kefir into the [[Cookbook:Refrigerator|refrigerator]] during the daytime when it gets hot.
* In cold weather, kefir will ferment very slowly. Put the jar or jug in a warm place, but not where it will get too warm (see above!)

==Kefir as leavening agent==

Kefir can be used as a [[Cookbook:Leavening agent|leavening agent]] when baking [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]], because it contains active yeasts and bacteria. It can be used directly in a recipe, by replacing the yeast and half the water with kefir. Recipes that specify [[Cookbook:Buttermilk|buttermilk]] or [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yoghurt]] can be made just as well (or better!) with kefir.

Alternatively, kefir can be used to create a [[Cookbook:Sourdough Starter|sourdough starter]]. Add ½ teaspoonful of kefir to ½ cup flour and ½ cup water, mix well, and set aside to ferment for 12 - 24 hours.

'''Grandma-Ag's Orange Bread''' - ''This bread is a fond memory of my childhood, visiting Agnes Frances Primm, my Grandma-Ag. As a young adult, I tried to duplicate the recipe, and unable, I went back and begged her for the secrets of it. When I asked her how long it had taken to develop the tricky recipe, she flattened my ego by telling me she'd gotten it out of a magazine years before!'' 
&lt;br&gt;I like to make it for Christmas.

==Ingredients==
'''List 1'''
*1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] grated orange peel 
*½ cup [[Cookbook:White sugar|white sugar]]

'''List 2'''
*1 beaten [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
*1 cup [[Cookbook:White sugar|white sugar]]
*3 tablespoons melted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
*3½ [[Cookbook:tsp|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
*2½ cups white all-purpose [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1¼ cups [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*½ tsp [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

==Procedure==
#Cover grated orange peel with water and [[Cookbook:boil|boil]] 5 minutes.
#Drain and rinse, discarding water.
#Barely cover with cold water, about ¼ cup.
#Add ½ cup sugar and cook until peel is tender and water is cooked away; cool.
#Preheat the oven to 350°F.
#Mix thoroughly all items under List 2.
#Add cooled peel to this mixture and 
#Pour into greased and floured 9 x 5 x 3 inch pan.
#[[Cookbook:Bake|Bake]] 55-65 minutes or until a toothpick comes out dry when inserted in the loaf.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Good warm and plain, or toasted and buttered.

Warning: The possession and use of cannabis is forbidden in many countries. '''Please read the wikibooks [[Wikibooks:Risk disclaimer|risk disclaimer]] before attempting to follow this recipe.'''


== Ingredients ==

* 300[[Cookbook:Gram|g]] [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]] chips 
* 180[[Cookbook:Liter|ml]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] 
* 250g self-raising [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] 
* 60g [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] 
* 2 large [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]] 
* a [[Cookbook:Pinch|pinch]] of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]  
* 5ml [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] 
* 4g [[Cookbook:Cannabis|cannabis]]
* grated [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]

== Procedure ==

In order to properly extract the THC from the cannabis, it is necessary to melt the butter and add finely chopped greens.  Cook slowly at a low temperature for a long time.  Depending on preference, one can strain the remaining organic matter out with cheese cloth or something similar.  Then simply mix your green butter in brownie batter with special batter and Voila! magic brownies.  Cook in an oven at 360 &amp;deg;F/180 &amp;deg;C for about 20-25 minutes.  This recipe should make about 9 medium-sized magic brownies.

== Different Methods ==

For a different style, why not try using brown cane sugar instead of normal sugar?  Also, melt some chocolate, mix with a little sugar, vanilla and lemon with a little more weed, drizzle on the freshly cooked brownies for a little added flavour and high.  This creates a nicer tasting brownie with more of a kick.

You can also try adding a few crushed up biscuits before cooking for a more varied taste.

# Cool on a wire rack.
# Wrap in tea-towel or foil several hours or overnight for best flavor.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* May serve [[Cookbook:toast|toast]]ed and buttered.
* Soda bread rises as a result of acid being mixed with baking soda.  The acid is commonly in the form of vinegar, lemon juice, or buttermilk.  A tablespoon of [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]] or [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]] in one cup of milk can be substituted for each cup of buttermilk.
* For best results, bake it at 375°F (190°C), for about 50 minutes, on a preheated baking stone.

===Overview===
Conventional bread, containing live yeast, leavens (rises) as the micro-organisms make carbon dioxide gas as a by-product of their metabolism. Similarly, soda bread utilizes the reaction between baking soda and vinegar, or some other acid, to make the bread rise through the production of carbon dioxide. This recipe uses buttermilk, or optionally a combination of milk and vinegar, but other recipes use sour cream.

There are two basic forms of clams with pasta. There are countless regional variations around Italy, but let's stick with the two basic forms for now.
* tomato-based sauce
* white wine sauce 

== Tomato-based sauce ==

===Ingredients===
* 1 pound dry [[Cookbook:Linguine|linguine]]
* [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|extra-virgin olive oil]]
* 2 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* 2 small [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chilis]]
* 2 pounds [[Cookbook:Clam|clams]]
* large glass of dry white [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]]
* 1 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* 1 can of [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]] (or, for a sharper flavour, replace half the can with chopped fresh tomatoes)
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* freshly ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]
* bunch of flat-leaf parsley or [[Cookbook:Cilantro|coriander]] (cilantro)

===Procedure===
#Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a large, wide pan with a lid. 
#Add the onion and fry until it starts to go soft. 
#Add garlic and the red chili (leave the seeds in if you like it spicy) and sauté for 2 minutes. 
#Add the tomatoes and simmer until it starts to congeal. 
#Start the pasta cooking in a large pot with plenty of vigorously boiling water. You're aiming to get this to be ''[[Cookbook:Al dente|al dente]]'' (soft, but with a bit of bite to it still) at the same time as the sauce is ready. This takes a different amount of time depending on which pasta you use. 
#Add the clams and wine to the other pan. Put the lid on and cook for about 8 minutes until all the clams have opened. Shake the pan to help them open. Throw any out that aren't fully open.
#Drain the linguine and add it to the tomato sauce. Add salt and pepper to taste. 
#Toss the pasta with the clams, put it onto plates, and add chopped parsley/coriander.

Serves 4.

== White wine sauce ==
===Ingredients===
* 1 pound dry linguine
* extra-virgin olive oil
* 4 cloves of garlic cloves
* ¼ teaspoon mild [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|red pepper flakes]]
* 2 pounds clams
* large glass of dry white wine
* 1 [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]
* 1 oz [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* salt 
* freshly ground black pepper
* bunch of flat-leaf parsley or coriander.

===Procedure===
#Start the pasta cooking in a large pot with plenty of vigorously boiling water. You're aiming to get this to be ''al dente'' (soft, but with a bit of bite to it still) at the same time as the sauce is ready. This takes a different amount of time depending on which pasta you use. 
#Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a large, wide pan with a lid. 
#Add the garlic and red pepper and sauté for 2 minutes. Add the clams, wine, and lemon juice. Put the lid on and cook for about 8 minutes until all the clams have opened. Shake the pan to help them open. Throw any out that aren't fully open.
#Drain the linguine and add it to the pan. Add the butter and salt and pepper to taste. 
#Toss the pasta with the clams, put it onto plates or dishes, and add chopped parsley and a thin sheen of olive oil.

Serves 4.

==Notes, Tips, and Variations==
* Of course you don't have to use linguine. You can also use other sorts of pasta. Penne work well with the spicy sauce. Spaghetti also works. But make sure the pasta is al dente!

[[Image:Oyster(L).jpg|thumb|300px|A shucked raw oyster on the half-shell]]
The name '''Oyster''' is used for a number of different groups of molluscs which grow for the most part in marine or brackish water.

The &quot;true oysters&quot; are the members of the family Ostreidae, and this includes the edible oysters, which mainly belong to the genera  ''Ostrea'', ''Crassostrea'', ''Ostreola'' or ''Saccostrea''.  Examples are the Edible Oyster, ''Ostrea edulis,'' the Olympia Oyster ''Ostreola conchaphila,'' and the Eastern Oyster ''Crassostrea virginica''.

Oysters can be canned, eaten raw or cooked. When caught, like all shellfish they have an extremely short shelf-life.  They should be fresh when consumed or serious illness can result.  Additionally, oysters can host various illness-causing pathogens.  Therefore, consumption of raw oysters should be done with caution. Researchers in Oregon have invented a self-shucking oyster.

Farm raised oysters are listed at a &quot;Best Choice&quot; by the Monterey Bay Aquarium's [http://www.mbayaq.org/cr/cr_seafoodwatch/sfw_factsheet.asp?gid=19 Seafood Watch Program].

'''Shrimp''' and '''prawns''' are crustaceans, related to [[Cookbook:Lobster|lobster]], [[Cookbook:Crab|crab]], [[Cookbook:Crayfish|crayfish]], and [[Cookbook:Krill|krill]]. Prawns are not shrimp, but are generally indistinguishable in culinary usage; see the wikipedia articles listed below for details.

To remove the shells, start by pinching away the leg-like gill structure. Then split the shell from there, pulling it off the rest of the way. You may wish to remove the &quot;vein&quot; on the back, which is actually the digestive tract. If the shrimp are already deveined, they will be split along the back, and a good way to peel them is to simply squeeze forefinger and thumb against the tail. This will push the &quot;meat&quot; out and allow you to easily pluck off the remnants of the shell. Of course, this results in tail-less shrimp.

The easiest way to cook shrimp is by [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiling]]. Simply place them into a pot of boiling water and cook them until they change color, generally becoming pink. You can serve the shrimp with [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]], [[Cookbook:Ketchup|ketchup]], a mixture of both, or a fancier [[Cookbook:Cocktail Sauce|cocktail sauce]].

Shrimp also go well in [[Cookbook:Stir-fry|stir-fry]], including [[Cookbook:Fried Rice|fried rice]].

A more difficult and dangerous [[Cookbook:Deep Fat Frying|deep fat frying]] procedure can be used to produce [[Cookbook:Fried Shrimp|fried shrimp]]. There are several types including [[Cookbook:Southern Fried Shrimp|Southern fried shrimp]] (non-puffy batter containing [[Cookbook:Cornmeal|cornmeal]]) or [[Cookbook:Chinese Fried Shrimp|Chinese fried shrimp]] (puffy cornmeal-free batter, as used in westernized [[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|Chinese]] cooking), and [[Cookbook:Tempura|tempura]] (thin and sometimes flakey [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japanese]] style).

'''Hyderabadi Biryani''' is a popular variety of [[Cookbook:Biryani|Biryani]]. The Hyderabadi Biryani is so named as it is seen mainly in the city of Hyderabad, [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]]. The blending of [[Cookbook:Mughlai cuisine|mughlai]] and [[Cookbook:Andhra cuisine|Andhra cuisine]]s in the kitchen of the Nizam (leader of the historical Hyberabad state), resulted in a dish called the Hyderabad Biryani. It, like other biryanis, is made using [[Cookbook:Basmati rice|Basmati rice]] which is only found on the [[Cookbook:South Asian cuisines|Indian subcontinent]]. The [[Cookbook:Spices and herbs|spices]] and other ingredients remain the same, however the method of preparation involves more time. 

It is usually accompanied with [[Cookbook:Dahi ki Chutney|Dahi ki Chutney]], [[Cookbook:Raita|Raita]] (a yogurt dish) or [[Cookbook:Mirchi ka Salan|Mirchi ka Salan]].

There are 2 styles of preparing this variety. The ''Katchi'' Biryani is prepared with the ''Katchi Yakhni'' method (with raw gravy).  The raw [[Cookbook:meat|meat]] is marinated in [[Cookbook:curd|curd]] and cooked only by the ''dum'', or the baking process, which is done with [[Cookbook:rice|rice]]. This is a challenging process as it requires meticulously measured time and heat to avoid overcooking or undercooking the meat. In ''Pakki'' Biryani, where the meat is cooked with all the accompanying spices and then the rice is simmered with the resultant gravy redolent of mace, ''ittar'' and ''kewra'' in a sealed vessel with [[Cookbook:saffron|saffron]] and [[Cookbook:cardamom|cardamom]]. It is accompanied by side dishes like ''Mirchi ka Salan'', ''Dhansak'' and ''Bagara Baingan''.

The meat used in the preparation is usually [[Cookbook:mutton|mutton]], [[Cookbook:beef|beef]] - popularly called Kalyani Biryani - or, less frequently, [[Cookbook:chicken|chicken]].

There is also a [[Cookbook:Vegetarian cuisine|vegetarian]] version of the Hyderabadi Biryani in which the place of the meat is taken by a mixture of vegetables such as [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]], [[Cookbook:Pea|peas]], [[Cookbook:Cauliflower|cauliflower]] and [[Cookbook:potato|potato]]. The vegetarian version is called 'tarkari' biryani. The Hyderabadi Biryani version of the mixed Vegetable Biryani is the &quot;''Tahiri''&quot;.

{{see also|Cookbook:Katchi Biryani}}

==Ingredients==
&lt;div style=&quot;column-count: 2; -moz-column-count: 2;&quot;&gt;
* 1 kg [[Cookbook:chicken|chicken]] preferably in 16 pieces and a couple of drumsticks 
* 1 kg [[Cookbook:Basmati rice|Basmati rice]] 
* 1 cup finely chopped [[Cookbook:onion|onion]]s 
* 2 tsp [[Cookbook:ginger|ginger]] and  [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic]] paste
* 3 tsp [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|chilli powder]]
* ½ tsp [[Cookbook:turmeric|turmeric]]
* 100 g [[Cookbook:cashew|cashew]] nuts
* 4 or 5 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaves]]
* 4 or 5 [[Cookbook:Clove|cloves]] 
* 2 cm long [[Cookbook:cinnamon|cinnamon]] sticks
* 6 to 10 green [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chile]]s ground to paste
* 3 or 4 [[Cookbook:cardamom|cardamom]] pods
* 1 or 2 tsp [[Cookbook:cumin|cumin]]
* 2 cups [[Cookbook:mint|mint]] leaves
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Cilantro|coriander leaves]] (cilantro)
* 2 tsp [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander powder]]
* ½ tsp [[Cookbook:Garam Masala|garam masala]] powder
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:coconut milk|coconut milk]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:lemon|lemon]]
* 1½ tsp [[Cookbook:salt|salt]] (according to taste)
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:ghee|ghee]] (clarified butter)
* ½ cup [[Cookbook:yogurt|yogurt]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]], 
* 2 tsp dried [[Cookbook:coconut|coconut]] powder, 
* few strands of [[Cookbook:saffron|saffron]], 
* 2 cups finely sliced [[Cookbook:onion|onion]]s, 
&lt;/div&gt;

==Procedure==

# Make deep incisions on the chicken flesh - deep enough for spices to get absorbed but making them too deep could render the pieces smaller. Mix turmeric, chilli powder, salt, garlic paste, yogurt, and half-lemon's juice. Thoroughly apply this paste onto the meat flesh and let marinate for an hour. 
# Heat about 100 ml of oil. Roast cumin, cloves, cinnamon, depodded cardamom, bay leaves, ½ spoon cumin, 1 spoon coriander powder, and finally add onions(2). Wait a couple of minutes to add mint leaves. When onions turn slight brown, add marinated chicken and cook for about 20-30 min. It should NOT be fully cooked at this stage; add garam masala and coconut powder and turn off flame when about ¾ cooked. Gravy should not be much, chicken pieces should look roasted.
# Meanwhile, while the chicken is still cooking, prepare the biryani rice. Slightly rinse 3 cups of basmati, and add water little less than the volume of the rice itself so that its only half cooked preferably in an electric cooker. Amount of water actually depends on kind of rice at hand and your experience helps to judge it. Also add 1-2 teaspoons of salt to it. Take a few semi-cooked grains of rice and colour them with diluted saffron for garnishing.
# You will need a utensil of about 12&quot; (300 mm) base. Place about half of semi-cooked rice in it. Next, layer half of chicken on it again topped by a layer of rice (half of the remaining). One more layer of remaining chicken, finally with layer of rest of the rice on top ends the rice-chicken layering stage.
# Heat oil and deep fry half the sliced onions to golden brown. Similarly fry cashew. Garnish the top layer with these two along with 100 ml ghee, coconut milk, saffron rice grains and coriander. Lid the vessel and try making it airtight (but no pressure should build up). Put on high flame for 5 min before reducing it to low flame. The flame should NOT be at the vessel's centre, but on one side of it. Wait for 2-3 min and turn the vessel to heat other next part on its circumference. This way, keep rotating the vessel every 2-3 min for about 20 min. Every time you turn it, carefully disturb the contents by a shake/jerk so as to avoid settling of ghee at the bottom.
# Put off the flame and wait for about 10 min before opening. Before serving, mix the medley from the bottom. Serve with boiled egg halves. Enjoy. Rightly and carefully made, its an epicure's paradise.

'''Mirliton casserole''' is a easy dish that works well as a side vegetable. It can be made with either [[Cookbook:Seafood|seafood]] or [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]], though it is most commonly made with [[Cookbook:Shrimp|shrimp]] or [[Cookbook:Beef|ground beef]]. 

==Ingredients==
* 6 medium mirliton (chayote squash), halved lengthwise
* 1 medium yellow onion, diced 
* 2-3 stalks celery, sliced or diced 
* 1 medium to large green bell pepper, diced 
* 2-3 cloves garlic, diced 
* 1 Lb (500g) shrimp (whole), peeled (or 1/2 Lb. [250g] ground beef) (can be left out)
* 1 bay leaf
* salt, pepper, and parsley to taste
* bread crumbs 
* butter (1 stick, 1/2 cup, 113 grams) (olive oil may be substituted -- enough to cover your pan)

==Procedure==
# Place mirliton halves seed-side up in a microwave or oven-safe dish with approximately 1 inch (2.5cm) of water in the dish. Cover with foil (for oven) or plastic wrap (for microwave) and cook in oven (350F/175C) or microwave (high at 10 minute intervals) until mirliton are soft enough to stick a fork or knife through easily. Allow mirliton to cool enough to be handled and dice into large pieces. 
# Saute onion, celery, and garlic in butter over medium heat, adding garlic to saute just before onion, celery, and garlic are fully softened. 
# Add shrimp or beef to pan until beef is lightly browned or until shrimp is just turning pink. (Skip this step if you aren't adding meat.) 
# Incorporate mirliton and bay leaf and allow to simmer for five to ten minutes. 
# Remove from heat and add salt, pepper, and parsley to taste. Pour mixture into a casserole dish and cover with bread crumbs. Bake in the oven at 350F (175C) until the merliton is bubbling and the bread crumbs are browned.

'''Palatschinken''' or '''Palačinky''' are flat round cakes, similar to pancakes, but with a different dough, and much thinner, also similar to the French crêpes, though again with a different dough and a little bit thicker.

They can be rolled with sweet and other fillings (jam, vegetables, stews, mushrooms, cheese), they can be cut into thin stripes and put into broth, which is then called Frittatensuppe (roughly translatable as: soup soup of fried things) - Palatschinken are a very versatile dish.

The recipe originated in Czechia, but has been integrated very thoroughly into Austrian cooking.

==Ingredients==
*3 eggs
*250 ml milk
*150 g flour (wheat or spelt)
*possibly some mineral water (which makes the dough more fluffy)
*possibly some salt (yes, it makes even sweet dishes better as well)
*to your own taste, some drops of rum

use a coated pan that is as flat as possible and has a diameter of about 25-30 cm

==Procedure==
#Mix the flour with the milk, stir thoroughly, then add the eggs one by one and stir them into the mixture separately.
#Heat the pan well, 
#add a drop of oil, distribute it with a kitchen towel, put one dipperful of the dough into the pan, dip the pan so that the dough spreads as evenly as possible over the whole floor of the pan (alternatively you can use a special wooden tool, used for crepes, for spreading). 
#Let bake until the top of the palatschinke is dry (should take about 45 seconds to a minute), then turn around carefully and 
#let get brown on the other side as well (about 30 seconds max). 
#restart at step 3 to produce the other palatschinken.

If you want to keep the palatschinken warm for use, put them into the oven at 50°C.

==Variations==
* Add spices and/or herbs to the dough, according to the intended filling
* replace part of the milk with beetroot juice to produce bright pink palatschinken
* add spinach to the dough to produce green ones
* add saffron to produce golden ones
* filled palatschinken can be covered with cheese and baked

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Greece|Cuisine of Greece]]

==Ingredients==

* 1 large egg plant (aubergine)
* Greek olive oil
* Salt

===Meat Sauce===

* One large onion, chopped
* Six cloves of garlic, chopped
* Three tablespoons of olive oil
* One kilogram of minced/ground beef or lamb
* One large tin of tomatoes
* One cup of red wine
* Two tablespoons of chopped, fresh parsley
* Two tablespoons of chopped, fresh Greek basil (optional)
* Two bay leaves
* One teaspoon of sugar
* One cinnamon stick
* Freshly ground black pepper
* Two tablespoons of tomato paste

===Cheese Sauce===

* Three tablespoons of butter
* Four tablespoons of plain flour
* Two cups of milk
* Sprinkle of nutmeg, cinnamon and black pepper
* Half a cup of freshly-grated parmesan cheese
* One cup of grated cheese (tasty, edam, whatever)
* One egg

==Method==

Cut egg plant into 5mm slices. Lay the slices out and sprinkle liberally with salt. This leaches out the bitterness. Leave these for at least an hour.

Heat olive oil in a saucepan and add onion and garlic. Sauté these until the onion starts to change colour. Add the meat and brown thoroughly. Add bay leaves and cinnamon stick, and continue to stir the meat until all the moisture from the meat is gone. Add tomatoes, herbs and sauces. Mix through and allow to cook for fifteen minutes, stirring occasionally. Add wine and continue to cook until the sauce is very thick. It should have very little moisture in it all. Remove the bay leaves and cinnamon stick! Allow to cool.

In another saucepan, melt butter over a low heat. Remove from heat and add the flour. Blend this through thoroughly, then return to the heat and cook gently for three minutes, stirring continuously so that it does not catch. Remove from heat and add the milk. Mix this through then return to the heat and allow mixture to boil. Allow sauce to cook gently for one minute, stirring continuously. Remove from heat, add cheeses, nutmeg, cinnamon and pepper and mix through.  Stand sauce aside and allow to cool.

Rinse the slices of egg plant under running water and dry on paper towels. Heat olive oil in a frying pan. Place slices of egg plant in the pan and quickly turn to coat both sides in the hot oil. Fry until the slices are cooked (when they change colour and become soft). Repeat with remaining slices.

In a large casserole dish, lay slices of egg plant to cover the bottom. Cover with a layer of the meat sauce. Repeat layering egg plant and meat sauce until within three centimetres of the top of the dish.

Add the egg to the cool, cheese sauce and mix through thoroughly. Spoon this on the top layer in the casserole dish and sprinkle with extra grated cheese. Bake at 200 degrees C for 45 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool and set for ten minutes.

Serve with a tossed Greek salad, red wine and crusty garlic bread.

*225 gram [[Cookbook:Glutinous Rice Flour|glutinous rice flour]] 
*120 gram [[Cookbook:Tapioca Starch|tapioca flour]] 
*175 ml [[Cookbook:water|water]]

==Procedure==
#Mix Glutinous Rice Flour and Tapioca Flour until well mixed. Make a well in the middle, pour in water and salt little by little. Mix well with hand until it formed a soft dough, so you can make a little balls shape with 1 cm diameter. Make sure that the dough is not to hard, if necessary add a bit more of water. 
#Boil a lot of water in a big stock pot. Put the little balls one by one in the boiling water. Cook for about 5 minutes until they emerge on the surface of the boiling water. Take them out and drain. 
#For the sauce, mix all the sauce ingredients and boil until bubbly. Place the rice balls in the sauce. Cook for further 20 minutes and set aside.

=Biscuit Mix=


===Ingredients===

* 2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] (280g) all-purpose [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 2½ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* ⅓ cup (80g) [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]]
* ¼ cup (60ml) powdered [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* (⅓-½ cup / 80ml-120ml [[Cookbook:Water|water]])

===Directions===

# Blend together dry ingredients, then cut in shortening with [[Cookbook:Pastry Blender|pastry blender]] to make mixture as granular as possible.
# Use as Bisquick© in recipes.

=Variations=

==Backpacking Mix==

===Ingredients===

* 12 cups flour
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] salt
* ¼ cup baking powder
* 1 [[Cookbook:Pound|pound]] shortening

===Mixing===

# Mix into a coarse texture.
# Keep in refrigerator until leaving for camping/backpacking trip.
# Divide into 2 or 4 cup portions in baggies or other container for convenient use.

==Directions for [[Cookbook:Dutch oven|Dutch oven]]==

# Mix 2 cups with ½ cup water, milk, or condensed milk to use.
# Knead no more than 5 times, or biscuits will be tough.
# Roll out about ¾ [[Cookbook:Inch|inches]] or 2 [[Cookbook:Centimetre (cm)|centimeters]] thick.
# Cut into biscuit size circles.
# Place in preheated Dutch oven, starting at the wall and working toward the center.
# Replace lid, turning about ⅛ turn for a good fit.
# If heat is right, biscuits will be done in about 15 minutes, if brown in 10 minutes or less, the centers may not be done.

===Tips and Notes===

* About 2 cups of mix will pretty well fill a 12 inch Dutch oven.
* Place a few more coals or charcoal briquettes on lid than beneath it.
* Preheat Dutch oven until '''lightly''' smoking; a moistened finger tapped lightly on the metal will sizzle.

'''Hummus''' is a tasty and nutritious dip.

==Ingredients==
* 3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] raw dried [[Cookbook:Chickpea|chickpeas]] (or skip the soaking and cooking steps, and use 7 cups of drained tinned chickpeas)
* 9 cups water (twice)
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|T]] [[Cookbook:Oil|cooking oil]]
* ¾ cup (175 [[Cookbook:g|g]]) [[Cookbook:Tahini|tahini]]
* ¾ cup freshly squeezed [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]
* 12 cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] (peeled and roughly chopped)
* ½ cup extra virgin [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* 1 T [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* ½ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|t]] freshly ground black [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* approximately ¾ cup chickpea cooking liquid

==Procedure==
# Soak the chickpeas in the water overnight, then drain.
# Gently simmer the chickpeas with the next lot of water (generously salted) and the tablespoon of oil until very soft, but still whole (about 3 hours, or 10 minutes + cooling time if using a pressure cooker).
# Drain the chickpeas, and reserve a few cups of the cooking liquid (you will need it later).
# Rinse the chickpeas with plenty of cold water, while doing so, gently rub them between your hands to release the skins, they should float away with the rinsing water. After a several changes of water, and removing a majority of the skins, drain the chickpeas again.
# Using a [[Cookbook:Food processor|food processor]] (or other means), mix the lemon juice with the tahini.
# [[Cookbook:Purée|Purée]] (or mash) the chickpeas in batches, using the lemon juice and tahini mixture, the olive oil, and the cooking liquid as required to maintain the desired consistency (add the garlic to the batch with the olive oil, and process until smooth).
# In a large bowl, using a spoon, mix the salt and pepper into the other blended ingredients (add additional cooking liquid, if still too thick).

==Notes, tips, and variations==
* Use a pot that will hold several times the volume of the chickpeas and the water for cooking the chickpeas, because they will foam (the tablespoon of oil minimises that, however).
* Use olive oil (or Canola oil, it's cheaper) instead of the reserved cooking liquid to thin the hummus, it's nicer, but not as good for you. Alternatively, mix in a tablespoon of olive oil into a serving before eating.
* It's particularly good when eaten with sliced French stick ([[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]), but is also a nutritionally sound alternative to most other dips.
* Hummus freezes really well, so consider making a double batch, and then freezing most of it in containers small enough to hold two servings (they can be defrosted overnight in the refrigerator, as needed).

==Ingredients==

* 1 3/4 [[Cookbook:cup|cup]]s (400g) risotto [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] (plump, medium grain rice that contains a lot of starch, the types Arborio or Carnaroli are traditionally best. Other rices that work well are Roma, Vialone, Nano and Maratelli.)
* 1 [[Cookbook:tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* 2 tablespoons extra-virgin [[Cookbook:olive oil|olive oil]]
* 1 small yellow [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]] diced
* ½ cup (60ml) of sweet [[Cookbook:white Wine|white wine]], such as Riesling
* 4½ cups (1kg) [[Cookbook:chicken|chicken]] [[Cookbook:Stock|stock]]/broth
* 1½ (360g) cups cooked [[Cookbook:pumpkin|pumpkin]], or 1 (15-[[Cookbook:ounce|ounce]]) can pumpkin puree

* 1 cup (240g) grated [[Cookbook:Parmesan cheese|Parmesan cheese]]
* [[Cookbook:salt|salt]] and freshly ground [[Cookbook:black pepper|black pepper]] taste


==Preparation==

''Make sure your stock is simmering before you begin. It's important that the temperature is as high as possible, without letting the stock boil. The surface of the stock should just be moving a little. ''
# In a large thick pot combine oil, butter, and onion, and [[Cookbook:sauté|sauté]] over medium heat until the onion is soft, about 6 minutes.
# Add rice and stir until well coated with oil and butter. Increase heat to medium high and add wine. Stir constantly until wine has been absorbed.
# Add broth, ½ (120ml) cup at a time, stirring constantly, and adding more liquid as it is absorbed.
# Once the rice has absorbed all the broth, reduce heat to medium-low. Taste to check the texture. The rice should be firm, but cooked through. If the rice is too hard or dry, add more broth, ½ cup (120ml) at a time.
# When the rice reaches the desired texture, stir in the pumpkin, ginger, and cayenne pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, 2-3 minutes. Stir in Parmesan cheese, then season to taste with salt and pepper.

# Remove seeds and fiber from inside the pumpkin and cut into chunks. Place skin side down on a baking pan brushed with a little olive oil. Season with salt and pepper, scatter the marjoram and garlic over the pieces, cover with foil and bake about 45 minutes, or until soft. Remove from oven and allow to cool. Cut the flesh from skin into smll cubes and reserve the baking juices.
# Heat the chicken stock and check for seasoning.
# Melt 6 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons olive oil in a wide, heavy-bottomed sauté pan or pot. Add onion and gently sauté until soft. Add rice and stir until completely covered in oil. Now, add vermouth and stir until it is absorbed by the rice.
# Turn heat to medium high and begin adding stock, ½ cup (120ml) at a time, and stir until stock is completely absorbed by the rice. Continue this process until all the stock is incorporated.
# Stir in remaining butter in small pieces, pumpkin with its juices, and cheese. Serve immediately with a sprinkle of cheese and fresh marjoram to garnish.

This quick pastry is a no-fail recipe made easily with ingredients usually found in most kitchens. Be sure to use cold water and keep well-wrapped until ready to use.

In contrast to [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]], pie crust and other pastries should be made in a way that minimizes the development of [[Cookbook:Gluten|gluten]]. Once the water has been added, the dough should be worked as little as possible, to minimize toughness in the finished crust.

== Ingredients ==

* 3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]]s (700g) [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1¼ cup  (300g) [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]], beaten
* ⅓ cup (80ml) cold water
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] white [[Cookbook:vinegar|vinegar]]

== Procedure ==

# Combine flour, shortening and salt. Cut in shortening with fork (or pastry blender) until it resembles corn meal.
# Combine water and vinegar with beaten egg. Add to flour mixture a little at a time until a soft dough forms.
# Divide dough into three discs, and use or freeze individually.
# When using, roll out onto a floured surface to desired measurements.&lt;br&gt;
* Makes three single crusts.

* Note: When baking two pies at once, rotate the pies 180 degrees at 15 minutes and 45 minutes to ensure the crust does not burn due to its proximity to the oven walls.

The ancient Romans, who sacrificed a pig to their god Saturn about the same time Christmas is celebrated nowadays, are probably the starters of a Christmas tradition still alive in some parts of the world.  This is a recipe for a boneless, lightly salted Finnish-style ham, popular since about the 1940s, before which Finns used to eat several kinds of meats during Christmas.

This is often eaten with traditional [[Cookbook:Christmas recipes|Christmas cuisine]], including [[Cookbook:baked potato|baked potato]]es, [[Cookbook:red wine|red wine]], and potato, carrot, and rutabaga casseroles, as well as during the night or in the morning and in-between 'proper' meals with bread, mustard and milk. Ham goes well with almost anything. If you have been eating ham for several days with mustard, try chili for a change.


==Ingredients==
* 1 7-10 kg [[Cookbook:ham|ham]], lightly salted, boneless
* [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]]
* [[Cookbook:Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]]

==Procedure==
# If ham is frozen, thaw it in its plastic package, for 3 days in the refrigerator for a 7kg ham, 5 days for a 10kg ham. A 10kg ham is considered better-tasting as the pig has gotten bigger. 
# Before putting the ham in the oven, take it out from the refrigerator and let come closer to room temperature. If you intend to put the ham in the oven in the evening, take it out during the early morning. The ham should be about 10 degrees C (50 F)  when you put it in the oven.
# Use a wet paper towel to clean the ham a bit; then dry it.
#Place ham on baking tray in oven, with some water on the tray. Or, if you have a large roasting bag, there is no need for water. 
# Note: do not use only the grill as it lets drop all the liquid from the ham, messing up your oven if the roasting bag fails. However, you can use the grill and put the ham on it and baking tray beneath that. An aluminum foil can also be used on the baking tray. 
# Preheat oven to 200&amp;nbsp;°C (you can skip this if you are not worried about the possible bacteria on the ham) and let ham roast in the warm oven for half an hour, then turn temperature down. 
# Cook at 100-125&amp;nbsp;°C, for about 1 hour/kilo, so a 7 kg ham will take 7 hours or more, until meat thermometer shows 75-80&amp;nbsp;°C. 'Traditional' ham is ready at 80&amp;nbsp;°C but most take the ham out of the oven at 77&amp;nbsp;°C or so, when the ham has more water left in it and is considered tastier.
# The use of a meat thermometer is recommended because the actual temperature of an oven commonly varies from its setting; thus the ham can be severely under- or overcooked if you do not use a thermometer. Thermometer should be placed in the middle of the ham. Be careful that it does not touch the oven walls. You can test if the thermometer works properly before using it by dipping it in boiling water - it should show about 100&amp;nbsp;°C.
# After you take the ham out of the oven, wait a little while before removing the thermometer. It is recommended you do not pour the liquid from the bag or baking tray down the drain.
# Wait until ham is cool enough to handle, then glaze it with mustard and breadcrumbs. First remove the rind from the ham, then cover the ham with mustard, then with breadcrumbs. Put in 250&amp;nbsp;°C oven for 10 minutes.
# Ham is ready to eat when it has cooled down a bit. This makes about enough for 3 or 4 people for a week, but if you think you will not eat it all within a week, freeze the rest.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*It is possible to salt a ham yourself, if you buy ham from a farm or butcher or buy a pig in time to fatten it for Christmas. There are several methods available; here is one that is called ''tönkkösuolaus'': Use a 10kg ham, put 1,8 kg of large crystal salt into 10 liters of water which is near or slightly below 0c, ham must be completely submerged, let be there for two months, changing the water from time to time, during the last week you can keep ham in water only, if you want it to be slightly less salty).
*Several people swear by sauna-cooked ham, in which case you will put the ham in a sauna instead of an oven (glazing still done in oven), it will take maybe 12-24 hours for a ham in a 100&amp;nbsp;°C sauna, several days in a 80&amp;nbsp;°C sauna. Use a meat thermometer if you use a sauna to cook a ham and remember to have something beneath the ham collecting all the liquid. Often people also use a wood-burning stove to cook a ham, this method is hardest as you can not use a meat thermometer easily with one, so unless you have good instructions to the very oven you have (or have a spare ham just in case), this would not be recommended for first-time Christmas ham lovers.

''Be sure to use '''cold''' water and keep well wrapped until use.''

In contrast to [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]], pie crust and other pastries should be made in a way that minimizes the development of [[Cookbook:Gluten|gluten]]. Once the water has been added, the dough should be worked as little as possible, to minimize toughness in the finished crust.

== Ingredients ==

* 1 [[Cookbook:cup|cups]] all-purpose [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* ½ [[Cookbook:teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 cup cold vegetable [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|Tablespoons]] cold water [add 1 additional tablespoon of water as needed]

== Procedure ==

# Combine flour and salt in medium bowl.
# Cut in vegetable shortening with a [[Cookbook:Pastry Blender|pastry blender]] or two knives, until mixture is crumbly.
# Sprinkle with cold water; blend until mixture holds together.
# Shape dough into a ball; place on lightly floured surface.
# Roll out dough to 1/8 inch thickness.
# Line pie plate with pastry.
# Trim around perimeter for 1-inch overhang to fold under and crimp as desired.

== Note ==

To make two crusts, double all ingredients, follow procedure above, and divide dough in half.

== Pie Crust Edges ==

==== Simple Fork Edge ====
# Fold overhang under and press down with your fingers.
# Using the tines of a lightly floured fork, press the edge of the pastry to the rim of the pie pan.

==== Fluted Edge ====
# Fold overhang under and pinch to make the edge stand up.
# With the thumb and forefinger of one hand, pinch the outside edge of the pastry, while pressing from the inside with the forefinger of your other hand.

==== Rope Edge ====
# Fold overhang under and pinch to make the edge stand up.
# Press the pastry along the edge of the pie plate between the side of your thumb at an angle, pinch and slightly twist.

Serve your pumpkin pie warm or cold, topped with whipped cream or not!

==Ingredients==

* ¾ [[Cookbook:cup|cup]] (180g) granulated [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* ½ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 teaspoon ground [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
* ½ teaspoon ground [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
* ¼ teaspoon ground [[Cookbook:Cloves|cloves]]
* 2 large [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* 1 can (15 ounces - 425g) [[Cookbook:Pumpkin|pumpkin]]
* 1 can (12 fluid ounces - 350ml) evaporated [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 1 unbaked nine inch [[Cookbook:Pie Crust|pie shell]]
* [[Cookbook:Whipped Cream|whipped cream]]
* '''NOTE:''' 1¾ teaspoons pumpkin pie spice may be substituted for the cinnamon, ginger, and cloves; however, the taste will be slightly different.

==Procedure==

# Preheat oven to 425°F (210c)
# Mix sugar, salt, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves in small bowl. Beat eggs in large bowl; stir in pumpkin and sugar spice mixture. Gradually stir in evaporated milk.  
# Pour into the unbaked pie shell.
# Bake at 425°F (210c) for 15 minutes. Reduce temperature to 350°F (180c) 40-50 minutes or until knife inserted near center come out clean. Cool on wire rack 2 hours.  
# Let cool and serve.
# Top with whipped cream before serving.

==Notes and tips==

'''Before you bake.''' Make the batter ahead, if you wish, but pour it into the pie shell just before baking to keep the crust crisp.

'''During baking.''' The baking instructions start with a high oven temperature, then direct you to reduce the heat partway through baking. This is an important step which allows the crust time to crisp.

'''Is it done?''' Insert a knife near the center of the pie to test for doneness, as the center will still cook after you take the pie out of the oven.

'''Tempeh''' is a traditional [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Indonesia|Indonesian]] food made from soybeans. It is a [[Cookbook:Fermentation|fermented]] food, utilising a special type of mould that forms a cake. When fresh, tempeh has a nice mushroom-like smell and flavour.

==Ingredients==

* 400 grams (14 ounces) [[Cookbook:Soy|dried soybeans]]
* water for soaking the soybeans
* water for cooking the soybeans
* 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Cider vinegar|cider vinegar]]
* 1 teaspoon tempeh starter (or ''ragi tempe'')

==Equipment==

* [[Cookbook:Pressure Cooker|Pressure cooker]] or [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]], at least 3 litres (3 quarts)
* Large tray (or trays) for spreading cooked beans on to dry
* Banana leaves, zip-lock bags or shallow dishes for incubating the fermenting tempeh
* Somewhere warm to incubate the tempeh at about 30-35°C / 86-95°F (e.g. your oven, with the light on!)
* Thermometer (optional) for keeping a watch on the temperature of the incubator

==Preparation==
[[Image:Tempeh fava ready.jpg|thumb|right|Cooked fava beans, inoculated with starter and ready to ferment.]]

# Cover soybeans with water, and soak overnight or at least 12 hours.
# Remove the hulls (i.e. skins) from the beans by rubbing between both hands (see notes).
# Skim off most of the hulls either by washing them away or by using a [[Cookbook:Skimmer|skimmer]] or strainer. Some hulls may be left behind without affecting tempeh quality.
# Cook beans until just tender, not mushy; undercooked is best for tempeh (see notes).
# Drain beans, and spread to dry somewhere with airflow (see notes).
# Collect beans into a bowl, and mix in the cider vinegar. This acidifies the beans slightly, inhibiting unwanted spoilage organisms during fermentation.
# Sprinkle the tempeh starter over the beans and mix in well (see notes).
# Pack the beans loosely into banana leaves, zip-lock bags, or shallow dishes for incubating. Zip-lock bags must be punctured at roughly 1cm / &amp;frac12; inch intervals to keep oxygen up to the fermenting beans.

==Fermentation==

# Load the soon-to-be tempeh into your incubator, preferably on racks that will allow air circulation. An electric oven with a light on makes a pretty good incubator, because the light provides just enough heat to keep the beans warm while the fermentation starts happening.
# Incubate for 12 hours or so at around 30-35°C / 86-95°F with a heat source (unless it's already that hot where you are)
# After 12 hours, remove or turn off the heat source - the fermenting beans will be making their own heat, and may overheat if you keep them too warm
# Monitor periodically from then on, and remove when the beans are totally consumed by fluffy white tempeh with no gaps.
# After fermentation is complete, serve straight away in your favourite tempeh recipe, refrigerate for two to three days, or freeze for up to two months.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
[[Image:Tempeh tempe.jpg|thumb|right|Fresh tempeh at market, Jakarta, Indonesia]]
* Tempeh can be made from almost any legume (beans, chickpeas, split peas), most grains, and some nuts. Soybeans are probably one of the cheapest beans to use, but more flavoursome beans make more flavoursome tempeh!
* Tempeh can also be made from [[Cookbook:Okara|okara]], the presscake left over from making [[Cookbook:Soy Milk|soy milk]] and [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]]. In Indonesia, this is called ''tempe gembus''.
* There are many ways to remove the hulls or skins from the beans, including:
** cracking dried beans in a grain mill and winnowing to remove hulls
** grinding soaked beans in hands
** rubbing soaked beans between both hands
** rubbing cooked beans between both hands (but don't get burnt!)
** buy them pre-hulled - e.g. [[Cookbook:Chickpea|chana dal]], [[Cookbook:Fava Bean|split fava beans]], [[Cookbook:Pea|split peas]]
* Soybeans can be cooked easily in a pressure cooker at 15psi for 10 minutes with slow-release method, or on a [[Cookbook:Rolling Boil|rolling boil]] for 30 minutes in a saucepan. Soft, ready-to-eat soybeans are not the target here, so don't cook too long.
* It can be difficult to distribute the teaspoonful of tempeh starter through the beans evenly. To make the job a little easier, mix the tempeh starter into a couple of tablespoons of [[Cookbook:Rice Flour|rice flour]] first, then sprinkle and stir this mixture into the beans a little at a time.

'''Borscht''', or '''borsch''' is a hearty Russian [[Cookbook:Vegetables|vegetable]] [[Cookbook:Soup|soup]]. Recipes of borscht vary, but beetroot is an essential ingredient.

==Ingredients==
===Soup===
*1½ cups thinly sliced [[Cookbook:Potato|Potato]]es (about 3 small potatoes)
*1 cup thinly sliced [[Cookbook:Beet|Beet]]s.
*4 cups water
*1-2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Butter|Butter]]
*1½ cups chopped [[Cookbook:Onion|Onion]] (about ⅓ of a large onion)
*1½ teaspoons [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]]
*1 stalk [[Cookbook:Celery|Celery]], chopped
*1 medium [[Cookbook:Carrot|Carrot]], chopped
*3 to 4 cups shredded [[Cookbook:Cabbage|Cabbage]] (about ⅓ of a large cabbage)
*a little fresh ground [[Cookbook:Black pepper|Black pepper]]
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Dill|Dill]] weed
*1 to 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Cider vinegar|Cider vinegar]]
*1 to 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Brown sugar|Brown sugar]] or [[Cookbook:Honey|Honey]]
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Tomato|Tomato]] purée or ¼ to ½ cup tomato paste

===Garnish===
*[[Cookbook:Sour cream|Sour cream]] or [[Cookbook:Yogurt|Yogurt]]
*Dill weed

==Procedure==
#Place the potatoes, beets, and water in a medium-sized [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]]. Cover and cook over medium heat until tender (20-30 minutes). While that is cooking, do steps 2-3.
#Melt the butter in a [[Cookbook:Dutch oven|Dutch oven]]/[[Cookbook:Stock pot|soup pot]]. Add the onion and salt. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent (8 to 10 minutes).
#Add the celery, carrots, cabbage, and two cups of the water in which the potatoes and beets are cooking. Cover and cook over medium heat until the vegetables are tender (8 to 10 minutes).
#Add the remaining soup ingredients (including the potatoes, beets, and the rest of the water in which they are cooking). Cover and simmer for at least 15 more minutes. Correct the seasonings. If it is too thin, let it simmer uncovered, and maybe add a ''little'' more tomato paste. 
#Serve hot, topped with sour cream or yoghurt and sprinkled with dill. (If desired the sour cream or yoghurt can be served with the soup and used as a condiment to taste.) 

Serves about 6.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Sour environment is essential for the authentic taste and preservation of the red color, but excessive amount of [[Wikipedia:acetic acid|acetic acid]] from the vinegar (esp. distilled) causes sharp restaurant smell and taste. The cider vinegar can be replaced with sauerkraut or extra tomatoes.

#Beat egg yolks in a small bowl. Add about ½ cup (120g) of hot lemon mixture into eggs and stir well. This tempers the egg yolks so they won't [[Cookbook:Scrambled Eggs|scramble]] when added to the simmering lemon mixture.
#Pour tempered egg mixture into pan of simmering lemon mixture. Stir until well mixed.
#Continue simmering lemon filling about 2 minutes until it thickens, stirring constantly.
#Pour into cooked pie shell and allow to cool.

===Meringue===
#Place 4 egg whites in [[Cookbook:Mixer|mixer]] and beat at high speed until they start to foam.
#While continuing to beat, add sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time. Beat about 30-seconds between spoonfuls of sugar.
#Continue to beat egg whites until they can form stiff peaks.
#Spread meringue over pie, starting on lemon pie filling, using rubber [[Cookbook:Spatula|spatula]]. Spread over edges of crust, completely sealing in the lemon pie filling.
#To form peaks in meringue, using a rubber spatula, touch flat side of spatula on meringue and pull away. Repeat over entire surface of meringue.
#Place pie in [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|350°F]] (180°C) oven for 15 minutes until high points of meringue are lightly browned.
#Serve at room temperature or chilled.

==Warnings==
* The pie filling is quite hot when pouring it into pie shell. 
* Keep this pie refrigerated.

{{recipesummary|Casserole recipes|4|45 minutes|2|Image=[[Image:Green bean casserole.jpg|300px]]}}

'''Green bean casserole''' was invented in 1955 by the Campbell Soup Company. It has since become a Thanksgiving favorite in the United States.

There are many basic recipes for green bean casserole.  Here is one example:

==Ingredients==
*1 can (approx. 14.5 ounces) French-style [[Cookbook:Green Bean|green beans]], drained
*1 can or jar (approx. 15 ounces) small whole [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], drained
*2 tablespoons diced drained [[Cookbook:Pimento|pimiento]]
*1 can (10¾ ounces) condensed cream of mushroom soup
    
===Topping===
*¼ cup fine [[Cookbook:Bread Crumb|bread crumbs]]
*¼ cup grated [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan cheese]]

==Procedure==
# In a lightly buttered 1½-quart casserole, combine green beans, onions, diced pimiento, and mushroom soup. 
# Combine topping ingredients; sprinkle over the top of the casserole. 
# Bake, uncovered, at 350°F (175°C) for 25 to 30 minutes. 

Serves 4.

==Alternative recipe==

===Ingredients===

* 8 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] cooked [[Cookbook:Green Bean|green beans]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 2⅔ cups (canned) French fried [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], divided into 2 equal portions
* ¼ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Pepper|ground black pepper]]
* 2 10¾-[[Cookbook:Ounce|ounce]] cans cream of [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushroom]] [[Cookbook:Soup|soup]]
* 2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]

===Procedure===

# Preheat [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]] to [[Cookbook:Oven temperatures|350°F]] (175°C).
# Stir beans, milk, ½ of onions, pepper, soup, and soy sauce in a 3-quart casserole.
# [[Cookbook:Baking|Bake]] until hot, about 25 minutes.
# Sprinkle top with rest of onions.
# Bake another 5 minutes.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* Cream of mushroom soup may be regular or reduced sodium.
* If you love [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]], substitute ½ cup shredded cheese for the soy sauce.
* ½ cup of chopped [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|red bell peppers]] will make it very colorful.

[[Image:CookbookPancake.jpg|right|thumb|200px|3 pancakes with real [[Cookbook:Maple_Syrup|maple syrup]]]]
These pancakes make a good [[Cookbook:Breakfast|breakfast]] for a family. They go well with real [[Cookbook:Maple Syrup|maple syrup]]. They are healthly too (as long as you don't over do the syrup) since whole wheat flour contributes to your fiber intake.

==Ingredients==

* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Whole Wheat|whole wheat]] [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] common granulated [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* 1/4 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]
* additional oil for [[Cookbook:Frying|frying]]

==Procedure==

#Oil a frying pan.
#Mix the dry ingredients in one bowl.
#In another bowl, scramble the egg, then add the other wet ingredients. This includes the 2 tablespoons of oil.
#Mix the dry and wet ingredients together, well enough to eliminate dry spots but no more.
#Heat the frying pan to medium temperature.  The pan is hot enough when a drop of water dances around rather than simply boiling away.
#Pour a pancake, about 4 inches in diameter using about a 1/4 cup of batter. (see below for making large and very large ones in a regular frying pan)
#The pancake will bubble. When the bubbling settles down and the edges are slightly dry, flip the pancake.
#When the pancake looks done, remove it and start another one.

==Toppings==
Traditionally, pancakes are topped with butter and maple syrup.  Other toppings can include strawberries, applesauce, cinnamon, or sugar.

==Variations==

The pancakes will come out thinner if you overmix them, let the batter sit for a long time, use white flour instead of wheat, or increase the liquid. Doing the opposite will result in thick pancakes. Pouring the batter with a spiral motion will be needed to prevent very large pancakes from being too thick in the middle. If using white flour, the milk should be reduced to 1/2 cup or 3/4 cup.

Large pancakes normally require a professional flat cooktop (no pan) and a very large turner. You can produce large pancakes one at a time in a normal small frying pan though, by air flipping. This is also known as the Boy Scout method, because it's a rather macho way to flip your pancakes. You should be using a non-stick pan. Loosen the pancake with a normal turner, so that the pancake slides freely. Put the turner down. Rapidly move the pan away from you, then up, then back just a bit toward you, and then very rapidly downward. Catch the pancake in the pan. You have to be brave in doing this; any hesitation will cause you to lose the pancake.

Filled pancakes can be made. Soon after pouring the pancake, take a spoonful of something (chocolate sauce, chocolate chips, wild (small) [[Cookbook:Blueberry|blueberries]], maple syrup, or [[Cookbook:Jam|jam]]) and put it in the middle. Cover the exposed filling with more batter. (direct contact between the filling and pan can overheat it and cause it to pop)

By increasing the sugar to 1/3 cup, you can make pancakes that don't require a sweetened topping.

You can also use cheese to cover one side of the pancake. You can do this right after pouring the batter, or use cheese as a topping when it's done. When adding them after pouring the batter you must be careful flipping the pancake, since the cheese will get stuck if you don't use a non-stick pan.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Flatbread|Flatbread]]

'''Pancakes''' are a type of [[Cookbook:Flatbread|flatbread]] prepared from a [[Cookbook:Batter|batter]] that is baked on a hot griddle or frying pan.  They exist in several variations in many different local [[Cookbook:Cuisine|cuisine]]s.  Most pancakes are [[Cookbook:Quick Bread|quick bread]]s, although some are also made using a [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]]-raised or fermented batter.  Here are some basic pancake recipes.


==Pancakes from Scratch==
===Ingredients===
*1 cup all-purpose [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] (white, whole grain or 1:1 mix of white and whole grain)
*1½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
*1 pinch [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] (substitute buttermilk or 1:1 mix of milk and buttermilk)
*3 [[Cookbook:Eggs|eggs]], [[Cookbook:Separate|separated]]

===Procedure===
#In large bowl, [[Cookbook:Mix|mix]] dry ingredients together until well-blended.
#Add milk and [[Cookbook:Mix Well|mix well]] until smooth.
#[[Cookbook:Separate|Separate]] eggs, placing the whites in a medium bowl and the yolks in the batter. [[Cookbook:Mix Well|Mix well]].
#[[Cookbook:Beat|Beat]] whites until stiff and then [[Cookbook:Fold|fold]] into batter gently (skip this step for heavier pancakes or if 1 cup buttermilk is substituted for milk).
#Pour ladlefulls of the mixture into a non-stick pan, one at a time.
#Cook until the edges are dry and bubbles appear on surface.  Turn; cook until golden.  Serves 12 to 14 pancakes.

===Notes, tips, and variations===
# Serve with butter, maple syrup, fruit, jam or cheese.
# Pancakes do not store well.
# Use [[Cookbook:Buttermilk|buttermilk]] instead of milk, or wholegrain flours instead of white.  This will change the consistency of the final product (i.e. whole grain flours generally lead to a denser heavier pancake, so try mixing white and wheat in various proportions as suggested above to get the feel you want).  
# Add sliced fruit such as [[Cookbook:Banana|banana]] and [[Cookbook:Apple|apple]], or broken crispy bacon to the batter after pouring into the skillet and before flipping.

==Banana-Spirulina Pancakes (Vegan)==
This is a recipe for '''Banana-Spirulina Pancakes''' that makes about 5-6 large pancakes (serves two people well).

===Materials===

*1¼ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Flour|Flour]] (check that label!)
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|Sugar]]
*2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Baking powder|Baking powder]]
*½ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]]
*About 1 teaspoon powdered [[Cookbook:Spirulina|Spirulina]] (optional, but recommended)
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|Vegetable oil]]
*1¼ cup [[Cookbook:Rice milk|Rice milk]] ([[Cookbook:Soy milk|soy]] might also work)
*1 thinly sliced [[Cookbook:Banana|Banana]] (if you freeze the banana first, you can get very thin slices)
*non-stick [[Cookbook:skillet|skillet]], [[Cookbook:sauté pan|sauté pan]], or [[Cookbook:griddle|griddle]]
*[[Cookbook:Spatula|Spatula]]
*[[Cookbook:Maple syrup|Maple syrup]]
*non-stick spray

===Steps===
Sift and mix flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and spirulina in a big bowl.
# In a separate bowl, mix oil and milk.
# Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients.
# Dump in the liquid ingredients and lightly mix the two together.
# Do not whisk, beat, or otherwise try to mash out all of the batter lumps. You will end up with tough, flat, and ugly pancakes. Keep a light hand, and your pancakes will remember by yielding fluffy results.
# Gently toss in the bananas and stir them just to coat in the batter.
# Heat up the non-stick pan and spray evenly with oil.
# Using a 1/3 cup measure as a scoop, dip into the batter and pour evenly into the [[Cookbook:Skillet|skillet]]. Watch your heat carefully, you want it on medium-hot (don't burn them).
# When bubbles begin to form in the middle of the pancake, and the edges look somewhat set, give it another spray of oil.
# Immediately, flip over.
# Cook for another minute or so, then remove the pancake, and put it in the toaster oven on warm (Or find some way of keeping it warm while you finish off the batter).
# Spray the pan again, and repeat until the batter is all gone.

===Serving Tips===

A light maple syrup is very good. Some prefer this without anything.

==Ingredients==

* 1¼ [[Cookbook:cup|cup]]s warm [[Cookbook:water|water]]
* 2 packages dry [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1 tablespoon melted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* 1½ [[Cookbook:teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 3½ cups [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* ½ [[Cookbook:Pound|pound]] slivered [[Cookbook:Pepperoni|pepperoni]]
* ½ cup shredded [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]]

==Procedure==

# Stir yeast and sugar into warm water. Let stand until bubbly.
# Add the salt and about half the flour so the dough can be handled.
# Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, adding flour only if necessary.
# Cover the ball of dough and let sit 10-15 minutes.
# Roll into 14x16-inch rectangle.
# Spread with slivered pepperoni, cheese, and herbs of your choice.
# Sprinkle liberally with fresh grated black pepper.
# Roll as you would a jellyroll, sealing edge by [[Cookbook:Pinch|pinching]]. Form the roll into a circle.

'''[[Cookbook:Dutch Oven|Dutch oven]]'''
# Put in 14-inch Dutch oven.
# Let rise.
# Place 11 charcoal briquettes on bottom and 17 on top.
# Time/temperature: see &quot;Notes&quot; below.
# Brush with melted butter.

'''Conventional oven'''
# Place in a well-greased round pan. A cast iron fry pan works well.
# Let rise for one hour.
# [[Cookbook:Bake|Bake]] at [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|375°F]] for one hour.
# Brush with melted butter.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* Rising bread requires warmth. Cool or dry weather inhibits the process. When outside temperatures are too cool for breads to rise, place 3-4 hot coals on top of the oven with bread inside. If it's windy, provide a windbreak.
* Start baking breads slightly before reaching the &quot;double&quot; stage. As the oven heats, the dough continues to rise. Have the bottom heat ready to go when the bread is. Add top heat immediately. When bread is ⅔ baked, take off bottom heat.

=Chocolate Glaze=

===Ingredients===

* 1 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounce]] unsweetened [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]] or [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Powdered Sugar|powdered sugar]]
* 5 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiling]] [[Cookbook:Water|water]] [[Cookbook:Boil|boil]]

===Procedure===

# Heat chocolate and margarine over low heat until melted.
# Blend in powdered sugar and water until smooth.
# Stir in additional boiling water, ½ teaspoon at at time, until of drizzling consistency.
''Makes about ½ cup glaze.''


=Caramel Sauce=

===Ingredients===

* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] packed [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]]
* ½ cup [[Cookbook:Cream|heavy whipping cream]]
* ¼ cup [[Cookbook:Corn Syrup|corn syrup]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]] or [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] ground [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]

=Easy Chocolate Curls=

===Procedure===

# Place a bar or block of [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]] on waxed paper. Make chocolate curls by pulling a [[Cookbook:Vegetable Peeler|vegetable peeler]] toward you across the flattest side of the chocolate, pressing firmly in long, thin strokes.
Small curls can be made by using the side of the chocolate bar.
# Transfer each curl carefully with a toothpick to wax-lined [[Cookbook:Cookie Sheet|cookie sheet]] or directly onto frosted cake, pie or other dessert.

The curls will be easier to make if the chocolate is slightly warm, so let the chocolate stand in a warm place for about 15 minutes before making curls.
Semi-sweet chocolate can be used, but the curls will be small.

Also, the thicker the bar of chocolate, the larger your curls will be.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Mexico|Cuisine of Mexico]]

'''Machacado con huevo''' is a dish which consists of shredded dry [[Cookbook:beef|beef]] that is [[Cookbook:Scrambled Eggs|scrambled]] with [[Cookbook:egg|eggs]]. Its name means &quot;shredded with eggs&quot; in Spanish. The shredded dry beef, ''carne seca'', is said to have originated in the town of Ciénega de Flores, about an hour north of Monterrey, [[Cookbook:cuisine of Mexico|Mexico]]. The early settlers in the area air-[[Cookbook:curing|cured]] beef so that it would be preserved. This particular dish was made famous by Tía Lencha, a local woman who prepared it and eventually sold it in a restaurant. Today there is a commercially available Tia Lencha dried beef in most supermarkets in Mexico.

The basic machacado con huevo is made with eggs and dried beef. Chopped [[Cookbook:tomato|tomato]]es, [[Cookbook:onion|onion]]s and [[Cookbook:jalapeño|jalapeño]]s or serrano [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chile pepper]]s can be added, or [[Cookbook:Salsa|salsa]] can be cooked into it, to create another version.

Machacado con huevo often comes as a &quot;[[Cookbook:taco|taco]]&quot; presentation.

==Ingredients==
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:margarine|margarine]]
*6 large [[Cookbook:egg|egg]]s, lightly beaten
*2 cups shredded [[Cookbook:beef|beef]] filling 
*10 (8-inch) soft taco-size [[Cookbook:Flour Tortilla|flour tortilla]]s, warmed 
*1 (16-ounce) can [[Cookbook:Refried Beans|refried beans]], warmed 
*2 cups (8-ounces) shredded [[Cookbook:Cheddar Cheese|cheddar]] or [[Cookbook:Monterey Jack Cheese|Monterey Jack Cheese]]
*[[Cookbook:Salsa|Salsa]] for accompaniment

==Procedure==
#Heat butter in large [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|skillet]] over medium-high heat. Add eggs; cook, stirring frequently, for 2 to 3 minutes or until eggs just begin to set. 
#Stir in shredded beef filling. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 to 3 minutes or until eggs are cooked and beef is heated through. Serve beef filling with tortillas, beans, cheese and salsa. 

==Notes, tips, and variations==
Machacado con huevo can be served in a big bowl, and with some soft tortillas at hand can be prepared in your plate, can be served in the table as tacos, or can be eaten without using tortillas at all.

Queso fundido con [[Cookbook:chorizo|chorizo]] (Melted cheese with chorizo) is also something that can be found at the table when eating machacado con huevo. It is usually served at the table in a pan, and added to the taco.

# As water is put on to boil, start heating olive oil in medium saucepan, and [[Cookbook:Sauté|sauté]] bacon until fat is just clear.
# Add onion and sauté until soft.
# Add crushed red pepper and cook 2-3 minutes more.
# Add tomato sauce and heat through.
# Remove from heat, add Parmesan cheese, and serve immediately over spaghetti.
# May [[Cookbook:Garnish|garnish]] with additional Parmesan cheese.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* As this is for cooking, virgin or extra virgin olive oil is not necessary, any grade, even &quot;pure&quot; olive oil is sufficient.
* &quot;Al dente&quot; means &quot;to the tooth.&quot; The pasta should be firm in the center when bitten.
* Amount of crushed red peppers is widely variable to suit your taste.
* As we sat down to eat, one of my fellow troops reached behind him and got some bread from the counter, Dottore Schirra frowned and said, &quot;You would eat bread with bread?&quot;

The '''Original Texas-Style Chili''' version of [[Cookbook:chili con carne|chili con carne]] contains no [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]] at all, except [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili peppers]]. If using fresh peppers, they should have been prepared by being [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiled]], peeled, and chopped. If using dried peppers, they need to be soaked in hot water for 1 hour before being chopped.

==Ingredients==
*3 [[Cookbook:Pound|lbs.]] (1.3 {{kg}}) [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] or other [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz.]] (55 {{g}}) [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] kidney [[Cookbook:Suet|suet]]
*4 [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili]] pods (previously skinned and blistered, or else buy sun-dried chili peppers)
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] dried [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]]
*1 tablespoon crushed [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]] seeds
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Cayenne Pepper|cayenne pepper]]
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Tabasco Sauce|Tabasco sauce]] (optional but frequently included)
*2 [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] cloves, chopped (or more, to taste)
*2 heaping tablespoons ''[[Cookbook:Corn Masa|masa harina]]''

Many of the above quantities may be somewhat adjusted up or down, depending on personal taste.

==Procedure==
#[[Cookbook:Sear|Sear]] beef in a little cooking [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] (not [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]]) until lightly browned. Drop the seared beef, [[Cookbook:Suet|suet]], and chile pods in a large iron [[Cookbook:Skillet|skillet]] or pot (at least four [[Cookbook:Quart|quarts]]), and enough water (the reserved &quot;pepper water&quot; if you prepared the pods yourself) to keep the meat from burning. Bring to a boil, then lower heat, cover, and [[Cookbook:Simmer|simmer]] about 30 minutes.
#Take pot off the stove and add spices and garlic. Put back on the stove, bring to a boil again, lower heat, and simmer another hour, keeping the lid on as much as possible. Stir when necessary, but remember that too much stirring will tear the meat. Add a little more water if anything seems seriously in danger of burning (but as little water as possible).
#Take pot off the stove and skim off all or most of the [[Cookbook:Grease|grease]]. (The old-timers left it all.) Mix in ''masa harina'', which &quot;tightens&quot; or thickens the chili con carne and adds a subtle [[Cookbook:Tamale|tamale]]-like flavor. Simmer about 30 minutes more, until meat is done. Do a lot of tasting during this time, (1) to adjust the seasoning, and (2) just because a chili cook should do a lot of tasting. Serves 6-8.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*The [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]] is simply bite-size - traditionally, it was the size of a [[Cookbook:Pecan|pecan]] nut - or coarsely ground, with 1/2-inch plate holes in a [[Cookbook:Meat Grinder|meat grinder]] as standard. It must always be [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]], [[Cookbook:Venison|venison]], or other mature meats. Stewing meat also works well. Prime beef or [[Cookbook:Veal|veal]], on the other hand, are not suitable for chili con carne, as they tend not to remain solid. 
*Many cooks omit the [[Cookbook:Suet|suet]] as being much too greasy, although it does add flavor.
*[[Cookbook:Ancho pepper|Ancho]] or [[Cookbook:Anaheim pepper|Anaheim]] peppers are recommended. For an &quot;elevated&quot; flavor, use four pepper pods per pound of meat; for a milder &quot;beginners&quot; version, use only 2-3 pods. 
*[[Cookbook:Chili Powder|Chili powder]] is a barely adequate substitute in the original recipe, but lacks the subtle sting of the pods. A heaping [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] of chili powder is the approximate equivalent of one average-size chili pod.
*Crushed tortilla chips can be substituted for masa harina (this is what Alton Brown did on the Food Network show Good Eats)

This is a modern version of '''Jailhouse Chili''', as served in the Texas prison system. In the early part of the 20th century, those likely to regularly spend time in local detention facilities in the [[Cookbook:Southwestern cuisine|American Southwest]] were said to rate the accommodations among themselves by the quality of the [[Cookbook:chili con carne|chili con carne]] they were served. This became a matter of local pride and competition with other communities.

==Ingredients==
*25 [[Cookbook:Pound|lbs.]] (11 {{kg}}) coarse-ground [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]
*1/2 lb. (225 {{g}}) [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]]
*1/4 lb. (110 {{g}}) [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|chili powder]]
*1/8 lb. (55 {{g}}) [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]]
*2 handfuls crushed dried red [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili peppers]]
*1/2 lb. (225 {{g}}) finely-chopped [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]

==Procedure==
#[[Cookbook:Sear|Sear]] beef in a little cooking [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] (not [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]]) until lightly browned. Drop the seared beef and chili peppers in a large [[Cookbook:stock pot|stock pot]], and add enough water to keep the meat from burning. Bring to a boil, then lower heat, cover, and [[Cookbook:Simmer|simmer]] about 30 minutes.
#Take pot off the stove and add spices and garlic. Put back on the stove, bring to a boil again, lower heat, and simmer another 90 minutes, keeping the lid on as much as possible. Stir when necessary, but remember that too much stirring will tear the meat. Add a little more water if anything seems seriously in danger of burning (but as little water as possible).
#Take pot off the stove and skim off all or most of the [[Cookbook:Grease|grease]]. Serve hot.

'''New Mexico Chile Verde''' is the most popular version of [[Cookbook:chili con carne|chili con carne]] in the U.S. state of New Mexico. While there apparently is no canonical recipe for Chile Verde (''green chile''), &lt;!--- that I have been able to find---&gt; all versions involve roasting fresh green chile peppers and cooking them slowly with meat (usually [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] but also [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]], [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]], or [[Cookbook:Turkey|turkey]]), [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]], and [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]]. The consistency is usually much thinner than Texas-style chili and is sometimes listed on restaurant menus as &quot;green chile stew&quot;. In additon to being eaten by the bowl (sometimes with [[Cookbook:Pinto Bean|pinto beans]] or diced [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] added), Chili Verde often is treated as a [[w:condiment|condiment]] and is ladled over [[Cookbook:Burrito|burrito]]s, [[Cookbook:Enchilad|enchilad]]s, [[Cookbook:Hamburger|hamburger]]s, and [[Cookbook:Fried Egg|fried egg]]s.

The following is a representive recipe for Chile Verde, but there are many variations:

==Ingredients==
*2 green [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell peppers]], chopped
*4 large, mild green [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chile peppers]]
*5 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] water
*1 large can (16-[[Cookbook:Ounce|oz.]]) stewed [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] [[Cookbook:Bouillon|bouillon]] granules
*1 tablespoon dried [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]]
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]] seeds (''not'' powdered)
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]]
*8 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz.]] ground [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]]
*1 large [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], chopped
*6 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
*1/3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (240ml) all-purpose [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]

==Procedure==
#Combine bell peppers, chili peppers, water, tomatoes, bouillon, oregano, cumin, and coriander in a large pot. Cook over medium heat until peppers are tender.
#Meanwhile, cook pork and onion in a [[Cookbook:Skillet|skillet]] over medium heat, stirring occasionally, about ten minutes, or until pork is browned and crumbly. Drain pork and add to chile mixture. [[Cookbook:Simmer|Simmer]] for 20 minutes.
#Heat butter in the skillet over medium-low heat. Add flour. Cook, stirring frequently, until flour browns, about 2 minutes. Add flour mixture to chile. Continue cooking and stirring until thickened to preference. Serves 5-6, usually accompanied by [[Cookbook:Corn Bread|cornbread]].

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*If fresh green chili peppers are not available, dried [[Cookbook:Anaheim chili|Anaheim]] chili peppers may be substituted, but the results will be substantially different.

''This recipe is incredibly quick to prepare, rich in flavor, and makes a great side dish.  The butter adds flavor but can be excluded for vegan/low-fat diets.''

==Ingredients==
*½ to 1 T unsalted butter
*1 to 2 T olive oil
*1 T chopped garlic or shallots
*1 head (3-4 cups of leaves) tat soi or any other dark leafy green, base removed (tear into smaller pieces if using a large leaf plant like chard)
*soy sauce

==Directions==

Rinse greens thoroughly.  Melt butter and olive oil in a wok or sauté pan over Medium High heat. Add garlic and sauté until golden. Stir in tat soi and cook - stirring constantly - until lightly wilted. Remove from heat and cover, allowing the greens to steam in the pan for a minute or two.

When ready to serve, toss with about 1T of soy sauce.

These are a favorite for American breakfast, with butter, or jelly on top, even though they're not really muffins... and they've never heard of them in England!

==Ingredients==

* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] warm (105°-115°F) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]

* [[Cookbook:Cornmeal|cornmeal]]

==Directions==

# Combine milk, sugar, salt and margarine.
# Measure water into large warm bowl, sprinkle in yeast, and stir until dissolved.
# Stir in milk mixture and 3 cups flour; beat until smooth.
# Add enough additional four to make a stiff dough.
# Turn out onto floured board and knead about 2 minutes, or until dough is manageable and can be formed into a ball. (Dough may be slightly sticky.)
# Place in greased bowl, turning to grease top.
# Cover; let rise in a warm place, free from draft, until doubled in bulk, about an hour.
# Punch dough down; divide in half.
# On a board, heavily sprinkled with cornmeal, pat each half into a ½-inch thickness.
# Cut into circles with a floured 3-inch cookie cutter.
# Place on ungreased baking sheets about 2 inches apart.
# Cover and let rise in a warm place, free fom drafts, until doubled in size, about ½ hour.
# Place on lightly greased medium hot griddle or skillet, cornmeal side down.
# [[Cookbook:Bake|Bake]] until well browned, about 10 minutes on each side.
# Cool on wire racks.
* To serve, split in half and toast.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* You can also start the dough by mixing the yeast, the dry ingredients, and half or more of the flour, with the liquids at 145°-150°F, then continuing the rest of the instructions.
* After punching the dough down, many bakers let it rest 10 minutes.
* ½ cup of [[Cookbook:Currant|currants]] may be added to the warm milk mixture.
* You can substitute 1½ cups [[Cookbook:Flour|whole wheat flour]] for 1½ cups of the all-purpose flour.

# Fill large [[Cookbook:stock pot|stock pot]] with water. Add can stewed tomatoes, tomato paste, sugar, salt, onion, garlic, and beets, and bring to a [[Cookbook:boil|boil]] for 20 minutes.                       
# Add carrots, cabbage, and optionally the potato.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
It's very important to remember that this particular recipe is somewhat like wine. The older it gets, the better it gets. It is recommended to let sit in refrigerator for at least two days, before serving. The difference is truly remarkable.

'''Summer Rolls''', or ''Gỏi Cuốn'' in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Vietnam|Vietnamese]], are wraps of various ingredients in rice wafers, and are often confused with [[Cookbook:Nem|Nem]] or spring rolls (which, in turn, are often confused with [[Cookbook:Egg Roll|egg rolls]]).

==Ingredients==
* 4 [[Cookbook:Rice Wafer|rice wafers]] (rice paper, tapioca sheet)
* 4-8 [[Cookbook:Shrimp|prawns]]
* 50g cooked [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] or [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] meat
* 50g cooked [[Cookbook:Vermicelli|vermicelli]] (thin rice noodles)
* 1 [[Cookbook:Cucumber|cucumber]], sliced into fingers
* 4 leaves of [[Cookbook:Lettuce|lettuce]] (leafy variety - Romaine/Cos, Mignonette, etc.)
* 2 leaves of [[Cookbook:Nappa Cabbage|Chinese cabbage]], halved lengthways
* fresh herbs, to taste (e.g. [[Cookbook:Cilantro|coriander]], [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]], [[Cookbook:Mint|mint]])
* a bowl of warm [[Cookbook:Water|water]]

==Procedure==
[[Image:East-asian-food-spring-rolls-1.jpg|thumb|right|Ingredients before rolling]]
Repeat for each summer roll:
# Dip a rice wafer into the warm water and remove immediately when it is completely wet - it only needs to be in the water for a few seconds
# Lay the rice wafer on a board or plate
# Arrange a portion of the ingredients near the edge of the rice wafer in a neat pile, with the fingers of cucumber roughly parallel to the edge of the wafer
# Fold the edge of the wafer over the pile of ingredients, and roll it over once
# Fold the sides of the wafer inwards, to close of the ends of the roll you just made
# Roll the wafer up the rest of the way, to enclose the roll completely
# Set aside for 5 minutes to dry a little before eating

==Notes, tips, and variations==
* Summer rolls can easily be made vegetarian by omitting the prawns and meat, and adding more greens and vegetables like [[Cookbook:Bean Sprouts|bean sprouts]], [[Cookbook:Snow Pea|snow pea sprouts]], fingers of [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]]

{{recipe}}

A '''pasty''' (Cornish: ''pasti'', ''hoggan'', incorrectly written as ''pastie'') is a type of pie, originally from Cornwall, in the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]]. It is a [[Cookbook:Baking|baked]] savory pastry case traditionally filled with diced meat and sliced vegetables. The ingredients are uncooked before being placed in the unbaked pastry case. Pasties with traditional ingredients are specifically named &quot;Cornish pasties&quot;. Traditionally, pasties have a semicircular shape, achieved by folding a circular pastry sheet over the filling. One edge is crimped to form a seal.

==Ingredients==

* 1 medium [[Cookbook:Rutabaga|rutabaga]]
* 4 large [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]
* 4 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Pound|pounds]] [[Cookbook:ground beef|ground beef]]
* 4 [[Cookbook:Pie Crust|pie crusts]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste

==Directions==

# Preheat oven to [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|325°F]]
# [[Cookbook:Cube|Cube]] [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]] into bite-sized pieces, except the carrots and onions. Cut the carrots in half length-wise and then cut into quarter-inch slices. [[Cookbook:Dice|Dice]] the onions.
# Mix all the ingredients together, similar to a [[Cookbook:meatloaf|meat loaf]]. Make sure hamburger is mixed completely through the vegetables.
# Roll out your pie crust and cut in half.
# Put a spoonful of the mixture on half the pie dough. Bring the other half of the dough over the top of the mixture.
# Use a fork to seal the dough around the edges. 
# Poke holes in the top of the pastry to allow steam to escape.
# [[Cookbook:Bake|Bake]] for one hour.

==Rewarming==

* Place on a cookie sheet in the oven and make a tent with foil over them so only the inside is heated, and not the pie crust.
* By a campfire, just lay on a hot rock or on a plate tilted towards the fire; before long they are warm and ready to eat.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* Substitute venison burger or dove for hamburger.
* Vegetables - try corn or different types of beans.

'''Cheese sauce''' is a variation of [[Cookbook:Béchamel Sauce|Béchamel Sauce]].

==Ingredients==

*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1 or 2 cloves of crushed &amp; minced [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] (optional)
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]]
*½ teaspoon mustard (optional)
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] as desired

==Procedure==
# Melt the butter in a [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]]. Add the flour and garlic and [[Cookbook:whisk|whisk]] together over medium heat for 2-3 minutes, to make a white [[Cookbook:Roux|roux]]. Do not allow to brown. Remove from heat and allow to cool nearly to room temperature.
# Add hot milk to the roux and whisk to combine. (This will also work with a hot roux and room temperature milk.) 
# Add the salt, cheese and mustard and heat till just simmering and cheese has melted.
# If desired, you may bring the sauce to a [[Cookbook:boil|boil]]; once the cheese sauce has come to a boil, lower the heat to low and very slowly [[Cookbook:simmer|simmer]] for about 45 minutes. Stir it every so often to avoid sticking to the bottom (a whisk is appropriate here). Do not allow the sauce to brown. The longer the sauce is simmered, the smoother it becomes due to the cooking and swelling of the starch grains.

'''Hornickels' Glazed Onion Canapes'''

This recipe is a slightly modified version of the onion canapés that I find very enjoyable. Notice that the recipe is for 8 canapés and may need to be doubled or tripled to meet needs.

==Ingredients==
*1 [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:margarine|margarine]]
*2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]]
*1 tablespoon of [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]]
*8-10 [[Cookbook:Cracker|crackers]]
*[[Cookbook:Sour Cream|Sour cream]]

==Procedure==
#Prepare all ingredients by finely dicing the onion and melting half the butter in a small saucepan.
#Turn the burner up to gas mark 5 or medium heat. Add the diced onions into the saucepan.
#Slowly caramelize the onions, adding in the rest of the butter as needed to keep from burning.
#Once caramelized, add the brown sugar and the honey. Combine thoroughly until all the onions are glazed.
#Place onions attractively onto the crackers and finish with a small dollop of sour cream.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Keep an eye on the onions, they burn easily.
*All measurements are not exact, play around to see what you like.
*Makes 8-10 canapés.

''When I visited San Antonio, TX, years ago, my cousin took me to the Texas Folklife Festival, where he introduced me to fajitas, telling me that they were originated by poor people who cut &quot;beef skirts&quot; (skirt steak) across the grain to make this tough cut much more tender.''

* 2 [[Cookbook:Pound|pounds]] skirt steak or flank steak
* 4 small [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]]

* 12 [[Cookbook:Tortilla|tortillas]]
* [[Cookbook:Salsa Fresca|salsa fresca]]
* [[Cookbook:Chunky Guacamole|chunky guacamole]]

==Directions==

# Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat.
# Cook the steak on both sides, about 12 minutes for medium, and remove from pan.
# Slice the onions and peppers and [[Cookbook:Sauté|sauté]] until soft.
# Warm tortillas in a skillet.
# Thinly slice the steak on the diagonal, and arrange on a platter with the vegetables.
# Serve with salsa, guacamole, and the tortillas.

'''Alexandertorte''' or '''Aleksander Torte''' (Raspberry Filled Pastry Strips).

==Ingredients==

* ½ lb (225g) [[Cookbook:Butter|unsalted butter]], chilled, cut in bits
* 3½ cups [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 3 tbsp [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
* 1½ cups [[Cookbook:Jams and Jellies|raspberry preserves]] (12-oz)
* 2 tbsp [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], softened
* 2 cups [[Cookbook:Powdered Sugar|confectioner's sugar]]
* ¼ cup [[Cookbook:Water|cold water]]
* 2 tsp [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]

==Procedure==

# In a large mixing bowl, combine the chilled butter, 3 cups of the flour and the sugar and, with your fingertips, rub until the mixture resembles flakes of coarse meal. Beat in the egg and continue to mix until the pastry is smooth. Shape it into a ball, wrap it in wax paper, and refrigerate 1 hour, or until the dough is firm.
# With the back of a spoon, rub the preserves through a fine sieve set over a 1-quart saucepan, then cook over moderate heat, stirring constantly, for 3 to 5 minutes, or until they thicken into a thin purée. Set aside off the heat.
# Preheat the oven to 250°F (120°C). 
# Cut the chilled pastry in half and shape each half into a rectangle. One half at a time, roll the pastry between two sheets of lightly floured wax paper into a rectangle approximately 10 inches wide and 15 inches long. 
# With a pastry brush, coat each of 2 cookie sheets with 1 tablespoon of butter and sprinkle them with flour, tipping the sheets from side to side to coat them evenly. Then invert the sheets and tap them against a hard surface to dislodge any excess flour. 
# Peel off the top sheets of wax paper and use the bottom ones to lift the 2 rectangles of pastry onto the 2 cookie sheets. Peel off the remaining sheets of wax paper. 
# Bake 40 minutes, or until the pastry begins to turn a pale gold. Watch carefully for any sign of burning and regulate the heat accordingly.
# With a metal spatula, spread the raspberry purée evenly over one sheet of the pastry, covering it completely and smoothly. Slide the second sheet of pastry gently onto the first. 
# With a spoon stir the sugar, water and lemon juice together in a large mixing bowl to form a thin paste. Spread the icing over the top layer of pastry with the spatula, and set the cake aside to cool to room temperature. 
# With a small, sharp knife or pastry wheel, slice the Aleksander Torte into strips 1 inch wide and 2 inches long, cutting the ends on the diagonal.

'''Batooru''' is a [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|North Indian]] [[Cookbook:Fermentation|fermented]] bread similar to [[Cookbook:Bhatoora|bhatoora]], but is mostly popular in traditional Himachali cuisine. This bread requires overnight preparation.

==Ingredients==

* [[Cookbook:Flour#Wheat Flour|wheat flour]]
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 2 tsps [[Cookbook:Ghee|ghee]]
* [[Cookbook:Water|water]] as required to knead the dough

==Procedure==

# Mix wheat flour and salt together. Add ghee and mix well so that there are no lumps and the ghee is evenly absorbed. Add water in small amounts and knead well until the dough becomes soft and pliable. 
# When the dough is ready, form the dough into balls and roll them flat. Keep it slightly thick, unlike a bhatoora which is rolled to be very thin. Place the rolled batooru on a clean cloth and cover them with another moist cloth. Leave them covered overnight.
# The next morning, take the batooru out from cloth and shallow fry them like a [[Cookbook:Parantha|parantha]] and serve them hot. These are usually served with [[Cookbook:Sabzi|sabzi]] (spicy cooked vegetables), [[Cookbook:Lassi|lassi]] and [[Cookbook:Mango Chutney|mango pickles]].

{{recipe}} | [[:Category:Ingredients|Index of Ingredients]] | [[Cookbook:Fermentation|Fermentation]]

'''Cider vinegar''' - also '''apple cider vinegar''', '''ACV''', is a type of [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]] made from apples. Cider vinegar has a unique flavour, coming from the apples used to make it. Some recipes require cider vinegar, although other vinegars may be substituted.

Being made totally from apples, cider vinegar is [[Cookbook:Gluten-Free|gluten free]] unlike, say, [[Cookbook:Malt vinegar|malt vinegar]]. However, some commercial brands add wheat-derived substances such as [[Cookbook:Caramel|caramel]] (as colouring), so it is important to read the labels when purchasing.

Cider vinegar isn't hard to make; in fact, it's easier to make cider vinegar than it is to make cider! The basic procedure is to make cider from fresh apples, but use no preservatives and keep the lid open to let oxygen in. A recipe follows.

==Ingredients==

* 4kg (8 lb) fresh [[Cookbook:Apple|apples]]

==Equipment==

* two 3 litre fermenters (can be large bottles or food-grade plastic buckets)
* apple crusher or juice maker
* food-grade siphon hose (from hardware store or homebrew shop)

==Procedure==

# Wash the apples to remove obvious dirt, and cut out any bruised or bird-struck bits.
# Crush the apples, or put them through a juice maker, and collect the juice in one of the fermenters.
# Cover the fermenter with a cloth, or plug the opening with cotton wool if narrow, to keep out dust and insects. Don't worry that the fermenter isn't full, as it should be for making cider. With vinegar, air space is good, as it brings oxygen to the bacteria.
# Set aside somewhere to ferment, not too warm or too cool (about 18-22°C / 64-72°F is best). 
# Allow the juice to ferment. It should start getting bubbly within a couple of days. Note the progress, so that you can tell when fermentation has peaked and is slowing down.
# When the fermentation is slowing down and not bubbling so vigorously, siphon into the other fermenter carefully. Try not to get too much of the gunk that has settled to the bottom, or the froth on top - the aim is to get a clear cider without too many floating chunks!
# Set the second fermenter aside to ferment for two to three months. After a while, you should see a white film forming on top. Don't despair - this is the ''vinegar mother'', a structure built by the vinegar-making bacteria ([[w:Acetobacter|acetobacter]])
# After a couple of months, you can draw off two thirds of the vinegar for use, and top up with fresh, clear cider made in the first fermenter. 

==Notes, tips and variations==
* Use only glass, stainless steel, or food grade plastic when making cider vinegar. The acids in apple juice, and further created by fermenting to vinegar, will leach chemicals from other plastics and corrode some metals.
* Cider vinegar is better when made with a blend of apples including cider varieties - e.g. sharps and bitters, not just sweets - but pretty much any apples will do.
* Apple juice that is free of preservatives can be used instead of crushing fresh apples. Just add [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]] to get the initial fermentation going, and stir occasionally for the first two weeks to help encourage the acetic bacteria.

'''Bizcochito''' or '''biscochito''' is a crispy butter biscuit flavored with anise and [[Cookbook:cinnamon|cinnamon]]. It was developed by residents of New Mexico over the centuries from the first Spanish colonists of New Mexico. The recipe for making the cookie has been greatly influenced not only by local and indigenous customs, but also by recipes brought to New Mexico by immigrants from other Hispanic countries. It is served during special celebrations, such as wedding receptions, baptisms, and religious holidays (especially during the Christmas season). It is usually eaten with morning [[Cookbook:coffee|coffee]] or milk, after lunch in the early afternoon, or dinner late at night. The cookie is seldom known outside its various territories.

There is no 'official' recipe, or formula for making bizcochitos. Each region or area, and often each family, has its own distinct recipe for baking bizcochitos. Below is a basic, traditional recipe. However it can normally be divided into two different recipes, the Gonzales and Lucero recipes are the most popular.

==Recipe 2==

{{recipesummary|Pancake recipes|8 4-inch pancakes|prep 10 minutes&lt;br/&gt;5 minutes per skillet of pancakes|2}}

===Ingredients===

* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] all-purpose bleached [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* ¼ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]]
* ¾ cup [[Cookbook:Buttermilk|buttermilk]]
* ¼ cup [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 1 large [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] unsalted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], melted
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla extract]]
* [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]] for brushing [[Cookbook:Griddle|griddle]]
* 8 tablespoons miniature [[Cookbook:Chocolate Chips|chocolate chips]]

===Procedure===

# Heat a large non-stick [[Cookbook:Skillet|skillet]] or griddle over low heat while preparing ingredients.
# Mix flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in medium bowl.
# [[Cookbook:Microwave Oven|Microwave]] buttermilk and milk in a 2-cup Pyrex (glass) measuring cup to room temperature, 20 to 30 seconds.
# [[Cookbook:Whisk|Whisk]] in egg, butter, and vanilla.
# Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and whisk until just mixed.
# Return batter to measuring cup, stirring in a teaspoon or two of [[Cookbook:Water|water]], if necessary, to make a thick but pourable batter.
# Increase heat to medium and generously brush skillet or griddle with oil.
# When oil starts to spider, but before it starts to smoke, pour batter, about ¼ cup at a time.
# Work in batches, if necessary, to avoid overcrowding.
# Sprinkle 1 tablespoon miniature chocolate chips on uncooked side of each pancake as it cooks.
# When pancake bottoms are golden brown and tops start to bubble (2 to 3 minutes), flip pancakes.
# Cook until pancakes are golden brown on remaining side.
# Repeat, brushing skillet or griddle with oil.
# Serve hot.

===Tips, Notes, and Variations===

* Use all-purpose flour (which is softer than unbleached), not unbleached flour, to make a tender pancake.
* If using salted butter, reduce salt to ¼ teaspoon.
* I usually substitute a tablespoon of lemon juice (or vinegar) in milk for the buttermilk.
* Pancake batter should pour, not glug! On the other hand, runny batter makes thin, oddly shaped pancakes that frequently collide on the griddle. Stir in a touch more flour into thin batter. For batter that's too thick, whisk in water, a teaspoon at a time.
* The temperature of the pan or griddle is important: too hot and the pancakes are dark and raw; too cool and they're blond and hard. For tender, golden brown pancakes, heat the pan or griddle on low while you make the batter. Then increase the heat to medium and generously brush the pan or griddle with oil. It's ready when the oil starts to shimmer and, in any skillet or griddle other than non-stick, sends out tendrils that resemble an octopus or spider. But if the pan starts to smoke, set it down off the burner until the smoking subsides and the oil cools a bit.
* This recipe easily doubles for a crowd.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Southern cuisine|Southern US Cuisine]] | [[Cookbook:Dessert|Dessert]]

'''Key lime pie''' is made of [[Cookbook:Key lime|Key lime]] juice, [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]], [[Cookbook:condensed milk|condensed milk]], and [[Cookbook:sugar|sugar]] in a pre-baked [[Cookbook:Pie crust|pie shell]]. The pie is then baked, often with a [[Cookbook:Meringue|meringue]] on its top.  Other recipes (with slightly different ingredients) call for it to be chilled or frozen, using an unbaked [[Cookbook:Graham Cracker|Graham cracker]] crust. This makes it a popular summer dessert. The dish is named after the small Key limes (''[[W:Citrus aurantifolia|Citrus aurantifolia]]'' 'Swingle') that are naturalized throughout the Florida Keys. Their ferocious thorns make them less tractable and their thin yellowish rind makes them less shippable, but they are both tarter and more aromatic than the common [[Cookbook:Persian lime|Persian limes]] seen year-round in most U.S. grocery stores.

Proper Key lime pie is made with canned sweetened condensed milk, since fresh milk was not a common commodity in the Florida Keys before modern refrigerated distribution methods.

Key lime juice, unlike regular lime juice, is a pale yellow. As such, Key lime pies are also pale yellow.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Conch Cooking&quot; L.P. Artman, Jr., August 1975 Florida Keys Printing &amp; Publishing, page 74&lt;/ref&gt;  Green Key lime pies, such as the one in the opening scene of ''Natural Born Killers'', are not authentic,&lt;ref&gt;http://sneakykitchen.com/Recipes/key_lime_pie.htm Authentic Key Lime Pie&lt;/ref&gt; and the green color is due to added food coloring. Many &quot;Key lime&quot; pies are made with standard Persian limes since they tend to be larger and yield more juice, thus making them easier to work with.

During mixing, a reaction between the condensed milk and the acidic lime juice occurs which causes the filling to thicken on its own without requiring baking. Many early recipes for key lime pie did not instruct the cook to bake the pie, relying on this chemical reaction to produce the proper consistency of the filling. Today, in the interest of safety due to consumption of raw eggs, pies of this nature are usually baked for a short time. The baking also thickens the texture more than the reaction alone.

==Ingredients==
*1 prepared 9-inch (9 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz.]]) [[Cookbook:Graham Cracker|Graham cracker crust]]
*1 can (14 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz.]]) [[Cookbook:Condensed milk|sweetened condensed milk]]
*½ [[Cookbook:cup|cup]] fresh [[Cookbook:key lime juice|Key lime juice]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp.]] grated [[Cookbook:zest|lime zest]]
*2 [[Cookbook:cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:whipped topping|whipped topping]] or [[Cookbook:whipped cream|whipped cream]]
*lime slices (optional)

==Equipment and supplies==
small [[Cookbook:Mixing Bowl|mixing bowl]], [[Cookbook:spatula|spatula]], [[Cookbook:Mixer|stand mixer]].

==Procedure==
#Begin by beating the sweetened condensed milk and lime juice in a small mixer bowl.
#Pour the milk and lime juice mixture into the Graham cracker crust.
#Spread with whipped topping.
#Refrigerate for 2 hours or until it is set.
#Lime slices can be used for garnish.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*There are several variations that require cooking.
*There are several variations that call for raw egg yolks.
*If eggs are used, the yolks go in the pie and the whites can be used to make a meringue.
*Raw eggs can be hazardous to your health.

{{recipesummary|Cake recipes|8|prep: 30 min, baking 45 min|5|Image=[[Image:Sachertorte_DSC03027.JPG|thumb|right|250px|''Sachertorte'' from Hotel Sacher, Vienna.]]}}

'''Sachertorte''' (Ger. ˈzɑxər ˈtɔrtə; Eng.ˈsɑkər ˈtɔrt) is a chocolate cake, invented by Franz Sacher in 1832 for Klemens Wenzel von Metternich in Vienna, Austria. It is one of the most famous Viennese culinary specialties.

The cake consists of two layers of dense, not overly sweet chocolate dough with a thin layer of apricot jam in the middle and dark chocolate icing with shreds of chocolate on the top and sides. This is traditionally eaten with whipped cream, as most Viennese consider the Sachertorte too &quot;dry&quot; to be eaten without.

The trademark for the &quot;Original Sachertorte&quot; was registered by the Hotel Sacher, which was built in 1876 by the son of Franz Sacher.  The original recipe is a well-kept secret.

== Ingredients ==
* 6 [[Cookbook:egg|egg]]s, [[Cookbook:separating eggs|separated]]
* 1/2 cup (120ml) [[Cookbook:granulated sugar|granulated sugar]]
* 1 cup (240ml) [[Cookbook:flour|flour]]

* 1 tsp (4mL) [[Cookbook:vanilla extract|vanilla extract]]
* 4 1/2 oz (130g) [[Cookbook:dark chocolate|dark chocolate]]

== Procedure ==
# Butter 9 in. (22cm) pan and line bottom with parchment paper. Preheat oven to 325°F (163°C).
# Melt chocolate in [[Cookbook:microwave oven|microwave]], remove, and let cool, while stirring often.

'''Sachertorte''' (Ger. ˈzɑxər ˈtɔrtə; Eng.ˈsɑkər ˈtɔrt; Ger. zah-khuhr tawr-tuh; sah-ker tawrt);  is a [[Cookbook:chocolate|chocolate]]   [[Cookbook:cake|cake]], invented by [[Wikipedia:Franz Sacher|Franz Sacher]] in 1832 in Vienna, Austria. It is one of the most famous Viennese culinary specialties.  The word is sometimes split into Sacher torte.

The cake consists of two layers of dense, not overly sweet chocolate dough with a thin layer of [[Cookbook:apricot|apricot]] jam in the middle and dark chocolate icing with shreds of chocolate on the top and sides. This is traditionally eaten with whipped cream, as most Viennese consider the Sachertorte too &quot;dry&quot; to be eaten without.

The trademark for the &quot;Original Sachertorte&quot; was registered by the Hotel Sacher, which was built in 1876 by the son of Franz Sacher.  That original recipe is a well-kept secret. 

==Ingredients==
'''Cake''' 
*6 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]] 
*200 [[Cookbook:gram|g]] [[Cookbook:Caster sugar|caster Sugar]]
*125 [[Cookbook:gram|g]] dark eating [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]] ([[Cookbook:Semisweet chocolate|semisweet]] or [[Cookbook:Bittersweet chocolate|bittersweet]])
*125 [[Cookbook:gram|g]] plain [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*100 [[Cookbook:gram|g]] unsalted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*5 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]] [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] extract

'''Filling'''
*150 [[Cookbook:g|g]] [[Cookbook:Apricot|apricot]] [[Cookbook:Jam|jam]]
'''Glaze'''
*150 [[Cookbook:g|g]] [[Cookbook:Golden Syrup|golden syrup]]
*150 [[Cookbook:gram|g]] dark eating [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]] ([[Cookbook:Semisweet chocolate|semisweet]] or [[Cookbook:Bittersweet chocolate|bittersweet]])

==Equipment and supplies==
Oven. 2 mixing bowls. Whisk. Knife. Scales. Microwave oven with microwaveable bowl or a hob &amp; saucepan. Round cake tin (preferably [[Cookbook:Springform pan|springform]] with removeable bottom) about 20 cm diameter &amp; 10 cm high. A cup (or similar as temporary egg yolk container). Greaseproof paper.

==Procedure==
'''Cake'''
*Preheat the oven to 170°C.

''Egg White Foam''
:#Split eggs, putting the whites in a mixing bowl.
:#Whisk until fairly stiff and foamy.
:#Add three quarters of the sugar.
:#Whisk until fully stiff and foamy, incorporating as much air as possible.

''Butter Foam''
:#Butter should be room temperature and soft. Alternatively, carefully soften butter in microwave (do not melt). 
:#Put the remaining sugar in a mixing bowl.
:#Add the butter.
:#Add vanilla.
:#Put the first load of chocolate in the microwave bowl and melt the chocolate in the microwave, avoiding cooking or burning it.
:#Meanwhile, return to the butter/sugar mix and whisk until it goes pale &amp; creamy looking.
:#Add the egg yolks.
:#Add the molten chocolate.
:#Gently (not whisking) mix the ingredients in the bowl.

#Add the whites foam to the butter/yolk/sugar mixture.
#Add the flour to the mix via a sieve, carefully avoiding lumps of flour.
#Mix very gently, folding the ingredients together. Ensure the heavy chocolate does not all end up at the bottom of the bowl.
#Line the cake tin with greaseproof paper.
#Fill cake tin with the mix.
#Bake at 170°C for about 70 min.
#Allow to cool in the tin upside down until at room temperature (about 30 min).

'''Filling'''
:#Microwave the jam until it melts.
:#Cut the cake body in half horizontally and place the halves with inner (cut) faces uppermost.
:#Pour the molten jam onto both halves of the cake.
:#Allow it to soak in.
:#Reassemble the cake, with cut surfaces together.
:#Allow the surface to cool again.

'''Glaze'''
:#Microwave the golden syrup (150 g of syrup is about 100 ml) and remaining chocolate together until the syrup just starts to bubble.
:#Stir until they are smoothly mixed.
:#Allow to cool to about 25°C.
:#This should now be spreadable and able to support a thickness of about 2 mm on a vertical surface (test on the wall of the bowl) yet return to shiny soon after being spread. If it is too hard or soft, add more golden syrup or chocolate and go back to the microwaving stage. (The exact amount of syrup needed depends on the sugar content of the chocolate. You want about equal weights of syrup and chocolate for normal UK plain eating chocolate (which is 50% cocoa solids) but more syrup if using darker (e.g. 70%) chocolate.)
:#Spread cake body with the glaze.
:#Leave it to set.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Do not accidentaly get any fat (from the egg yolks, butter or chocolate) in the egg white mix or it will go flat.
*The little bubbles in the egg white foam are what inflate the cake.
*Do not allow flour lumps in the mix because lumps of white flour show up badly in this brown cake.
*To get the traditional perfectly cylindrical shape, trim the cake body into a circle with vertical edges &amp; cut the top off flat before glazing.
*Adding alcohol to the cake is not a good idea. It is already very moist and more liquid will make it soggy.
*Don't use white chocolate in the cake body because it is fairly unnoticeable by flavour and colour, leaving only the moistening effect.
*Don't use self-raising flour. It creates large bubbles in the cake.
*If carried out in the order above, no tool should need to be washed up more than once.
*There are several other recipes for [[Cookbook:Sachertorte|Sachertorte]], some use even more eggs in the cake and egg and cream in the glaze.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Fermentation|Fermentation]] | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Indonesia|Cuisine of Indonesia]]

'''Tapai''', also '''tape''' (pronounced &quot;tah-pay&quot;), is a traditional [[Cookbook:Fermentation|fermented]] food of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Indonesia|Indonesia]], although present in some form throughout [[Cookbook:Southeast Asian cuisines|South-East Asia]]. It can be made from various starchy staple foods including [[Cookbook:Cereal Grain|grains]] and [[Cookbook:Rhizome|tubers]], each giving it a distinctive taste and texture, and often a specific local name. Tapai tastes sweet, tangy, a bit yeasty, and is slightly alcoholic (or not so slightly, if left to ferment longer).

The following recipe is for a common variant called ''tape ketan'' (ketan means ''glutinous rice''; when made with black glutinous rice, it is ''tape ketan-hitam'').

==Ingredients==

* 2 cups [[Cookbook:Rice|glutinous rice]] (sticky rice)
* 4 cups [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* 1 cake of ''ragi tapai'' (see notes)
* Optional: a couple of drops of [[Cookbook:Pandan Essence|pandan paste]] (to colour it green)

==Procedure==

# Rinse the rice and cook it in the water, unsalted. If adding pandan paste, add it now. The absorption method is usually easiest: bring the water to boiling point with the rice in it, then put the lid on the pot and turn the element or flame down to lowest possible setting and simmer for 15 minutes.
# Allow rice to cool down to about 30°C / 86°F. To help it cool down faster, sit the pot in a basin of cold water.
# Crumble the cake of ''ragi tapai'' over the rice and mix in well.
# Loosely pack the mixture into a large jar, cover with a cloth, and set aside in a warm place to ferment (about 30-35°C / 86-95°F).

==Fermentation==

The tapai will ferment over the next two to four days. After about two days, it should start to show a little liquid at the bottom of the jar, and will start producing a distinctive smell of tapai. At this point, the tapai can be considered complete, although it will taste better after a couple of days kept in the refrigerator.

==Notes, tips and variations==
{{Wikipedia|Tapai}}
* Tapai can be made from plain white rice (''tape nasi''), or [[Cookbook:Cassava|cassava]] (''tape ketala'', ''tape telor'', ''peuyeum''), or even [[Cookbook:Sweet Potato|sweet potato]].
* ''Ragi tapai'' (or ''ragi tape'') can be a little difficult to track down outside of South-East Asia, but a little persistence should help find it. The same (or very similar) product is used to ferment Chinese rice wines, and runs under the names &quot;wine yeast&quot;, &quot;yeast cake&quot; and &quot;rice cake&quot; in Asian grocery stores. They look like crumbly little white balls, about 2-3cm (1 inch) in diameter. Just ask the shopkeeper whether it can be used to make wine. They can also be purchased on-line from some stores; try this [http://www.google.com/search?q=%22ragi+tape%22+%22shopping+cart%22 Google search].
* The liquid that collects at the bottom is actually a rice wine, called ''brem''. It will be very low in alcohol after only a few days, but if kept and allowed to ferment, it will become more alcoholic.

Focaccia Genovese Dough

==Ingredients==

* 5¾ [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] unbleached [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] or 4 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Kosher|kosher]] salt
* 2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Yeast|instant yeast]]
* 2⅛ cups cold [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* ⅛ cup [[Cookbook:Olive oil|olive oil]] plus 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] for the pan, divided

==Directions==

# In a 4-[[Cookbook:Quart|quart]] bowl (or the bowl of an [[Cookbook:Mixer|electric mixer]]), combine flour, salt, yeast and water.
# With a large metal spoon, stir together until all the flour is absorbed. If you are mixing by hand, repeatedly dip one of your hands or the spoon in cold water and use it, much like a dough hook, to work the dough vigorously into a smooth mass while rotating the bowl in a circular motion with the other hand.
# When the dough sets up, wash and dry your hands and let the dough rest for 5 minutes. Then add ¼ cup olive oil and dip your hand or spoon again in water and continue to work the dough for another 5 minutes until it is smooth and stretchy. The dough should be very sticky, but it should also have some texture and structure. Even if mixed with the wet hands method, it should still pass the windowpane test. (Snip off a small piece of dough and gently stretch it until it forms a paper-thin, translucent membrane.)
# If the dough seems like a batter and does not have enough structure, work in some more flour.
# Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl, turn it to coat the dough with the oil, cover it with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. The next day, the dough should have nearly doubled in size. If not, allow it to sit at room temperature for about 2 hours or until it doubles in size.
# Line a 12-by-17-inch sheet pan (technically called a &quot;half sheet pan&quot; as a 24-by-17-inch or full sheet pan will only fit in a commercial oven) with either baking parchment or a silicon baking pad (Silpat).
#Drizzle about 2 tablespoons of olive oil on the parchment or pad and spread it over the surface. Using a plastic bowl scraper dipped in water, gently transfer the dough from the bowl to the pan, taking care to de-gas the dough as little as possible.
# Drizzle the remaining ¼ cup olive oil on the surface of the dough.
# Using only your fingertips, press down on the dough, creating dimples and pockets all over the surface for the oil to fill. Do not press the dough outward toward the edges of the pan; instead simply press downward at only a slight angle toward the edges. When the dough fills the pan a little more than half full and springs back toward the center, stop pressing and let the dough relax at room temperature for about 15 minutes.
# Repeat the dimpling process, beginning at the center and gradually working out toward the edges of the pan. This time the dough will nearly fill the pan. Again let the dough relax at room temperature for about 15 minutes.
# Repeat the dimpling. This time the dough should fill the pan. Let the dough rise for approximately 2 to 3 hours at room temperature or until it fills the pan.
# Your dough is now ready for topping and baking.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* Makes enough dough for 1 (12-by-17-inch) half sheet pan.
* This bread spends more time in the pizza oven than most crusts, 30 to 40 minutes, so it requires special toppings that can take the heat:
** [[Cookbook:Caramelized Sweet and Sour Onion Marmalade|Caramelized Sweet and Sour Onion Marmalade]]
** paper thin slices of [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] and [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], seasoned with [[Cookbook:Rosemary|rosemary]]
** [[Cookbook:Marinara Sauce|Marinara Sauce]]
** [[Cookbook:Pesto|Pesto Sauce]]
** [[Cookbook:Roasting|roasted]] [[Cookbook:Pepper|peppers]] and [[Cookbook:Olive|olives]]

'''Socca''' (French), '''Torta di ceci''' or '''Farinata''' (Italian).

''See also: [[Cookbook:Calentita|Calentita]]''

==Ingredients==

* 300g (2 cups) [[Cookbook:Chickpea Flour|chickpea flour]]
* 500ml (2 cups) [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* 2 Tbs [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]] to taste; 2-3 decent grinds of a grinder should do

==Equipment==

Apart from having the usual kitchen equipment and a good oven, you will need something to cook the ''socca'' on. Traditionally, a 50cm (20 inch) copper plaque is used as it spreads the heat evenly to all parts of the ''socca'', but a good [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|cast iron pan]] will suffice if preheated in the oven first. 

==Procedure==


# Heat oven &amp;ndash; super hot, around 300°C / 570°F is traditional, but whatever your oven can manage that gets close to this. If using a cast-iron pan, get it into the oven at the start so that it is hot when the batter goes into it.
# [[Cookbook:Whisk|Whisk]] the ingredients together well, ensuring there are no lumps. This should make a very thin batter, easy to pour.
# Once the oven is up to temperature, pour some of the batter into the pan or onto the plaque, and put into the oven for 8-9 minutes at 300°C / 570°F, or 13-15 minutes at 250°C / 480°F. With a 50cm plaque or pan, cook half the batter at a time &amp;ndash; the batter should cover the plaque or pan very thinly.
# Remove from the oven and cut into triangular wedges. Serve hot.
# Repeat for the rest of the batter.

'''Bonda''' is a typical [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|South Indian]] snack. The process of making Bonda involves deep frying a filling of potato (or other vegetables) dipped in gram flour batter.

== Ingredients ==

===For filling===

* [[Cookbook:Potato|Potato]] - 2 medium sized
* [[Cookbook:Onion|Onions]] - 1 medium sized 
* [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|Green Chilis]] - 3-4 medium sized
* [[Cookbook:Cilantro|Coriander Leaves]] - 2 TBS, finely chopped
* [[Cookbook:Ginger|Ginger]] - Finely chopped, 1 Tsp
* [[Cookbook:Garlic|Garlic]] - Finely chopped, 1 Tsp
* [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] - To taste

===For Batter===

* [[Cookbook:Chickpea Flour|Gram Flour]] (besan) - 4 portions
* [[Cookbook:Rice Flour|Rice Flour]] -  1 portion
* [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|Baking Soda]] - ½ tsp
* [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] - To taste

===Other===

* [[Cookbook:Oil|Oil]] for Frying

== Procedure ==

'''Filling:''' Boil potatoes, remove skin and mash coarsely. Heat 2 TBS of oil in a pan and heat. When the oil is hot throw in green chilis and fry for a few seconds. Add onions and fry until browned. Add ginger and garlic and fry for a minute. Add the chopped coriander leaves and the coarsely mashed potatoes and fold well. Allow it to cool and make small golf ball sized balls.

'''Batter:''' Mix the gram flour and the rice flour with baking soda and add salt to taste. Make a smooth batter using water or beer. The batter consistency must be slightly thicker than ketchup

'''Assembly:''' Once the batter and filling are ready heat some oil to fry in a deep pan. You will need at least 1½ inch layer of oil to deep fry. Take the golf sized balls of filling, dip it in the batter making sure  the ball is completely coated and drop it into the oil. Fry until it becomes golden and remove.

Bonda is served with [[Cookbook:Ketchup|ketchup]] or [[Cookbook:Chutney|chutney]].

Caramelized Sweet and Sour Onion Marmalade


==Ingredients==

* 4 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Olive oil|olive]] or [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]]
* 4 large yellow or white [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], sliced into thin strips
* ½ [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* ¼ cup [[Cookbook:Vinegar|balsamic vinegar]]
* ¼ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* ⅛ teaspoon coarse ground [[Cookbook:Black Pepper|black pepper]]

==Directions==

# Heat oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add onions, and [[Cookbook:Sauté|sauté]], stirring, for about 15 minutes, or until they begin to brown. (Do not cook over high heat, as the outside of the onions will char too quickly before the insides have softened and sweetened.) When onions have softened and turned a light golden brown, add sugar.
# Continue stirring until sugar melts and begins to bubble.
# As the onions turn a richer brown, clear a space in the center of the pan. Pour balsamic vinegar directly onto the hot pan, then stir it into onions.
# When vinegar has reduced, leaving a syrupy coating on the onions, turn off the heat. Stir in salt and pepper, and allow onions to cool.

==Uses==

* Used in [[Cookbook:Focaccia|Focaccia]] ([[Cookbook:Focaccia with Onion Marmalade, Blue Cheese, and Walnuts|Focaccia with Onion Marmalade, Blue Cheese, and Walnuts]])

Focaccia with Onion Marmalade, Blue Cheese and Walnuts

==Ingredients==

* [[Cookbook:Focaccia Genovese Dough|Focaccia Dough]]
* 1½ [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Caramelized Sweet and Sour Onion Marmalade|Sweet and Sour Onion Marmalade]]
* ¼ [[Cookbook:Pound|pounds]] [[Cookbook:Cheese|blue cheese]], crumbled or cut into ½-inch pieces
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Chop|coarsely chopped]] [[Cookbook:Walnut|walnuts]]

==Directions==

# Preheat oven to [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|500°F]].
# When the focaccia is fully risen and ready to bake, gently spread onion marmalade evenly over surface. Evenly distribute blue cheese over onion marmalade and scatter walnuts over the top.
# Place the sheet pan on the middle shelf of the oven, lower temperature to 450 degrees and [[Cookbook:Bake|bake]] for 20 minutes. Rotate pan 180 degrees and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the dough is golden on the bottom and top.
# When the baking is complete, set up a cooling rack inside a sheet pan and immediately remove the focaccia from the pan by using a metal [[Cookbook:Spatula|spatula]] or pastry blade to break all contact with the walls of the pan. Place the spatula or blade between the focaccia and the parchment or pad and lift the edge up. Then jiggle the focaccia out of the pan onto the cooling rack. Pour any excess oil from the pan over the top of the focaccia. Let the focaccia cool for at least 20 minutes before slicing and serving.

Sancocho, popular in the Dominican Republic, called by many its national dish.

==Ingredients==

===Marinade and chicken:===

* 1 large [[Cookbook:Orange|orange, juiced]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] fresh [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]
* ¼ bunch [[Cookbook:Parsley|curly parsley]], large stems removed
* ¼ bunch [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]], large stems removed
* 2 tablespoons fresh [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano leaves]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Garlic|cloves garlic]], minced
* [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] and [[Cookbook:Black Pepper|freshly ground black pepper]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Pound|pound]] [[Cookbook:Chicken|boneless, skinless chicken breasts]], cut into bite-size pieces

===Soup:===

* 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:oil|clear oil]], such as [[Cookbook:Canola Oil|canola]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Stock|vegetable stock]]
* 4 cups [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* 1 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|white onion]], [[Cookbook:Chop|chopped]]
* 1 medium [[Cookbook:Sweet Potato|sweet potato]], peeled and cut into ½-inch chunks
* 1 medium [[Cookbook:Potato|boiling potato]], unpeeled and cut into bite-size chunks
* 1 [[Cookbook:Plantain|green plantain]], peeled and sliced into ½-inch thick slices (see Note)
* 1 [[Cookbook:Corn|ear corn]], quartered
* 1 [[Cookbook:Jalapeño|jalapeño]] or [[Cookbook:Habanero|habanero]] [[Cookbook:Chile|chile]], seeded and minced
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* Hot cooked [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]], optional
* Hot sauce, optional
* Chopped cilantro, optional

==Directions==

===Marinade:=== 

# In bowl of a [[Cookbook:Food processor|food processor]] or [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]], combine orange juice, lemon juice, parsley, cilantro, oregano, garlic, salt, and pepper, and process until combined.
# Pour mixture into a non-reactive bowl, add chicken and stir to combine.
# Cover and refrigerate 1 to 2 hours.

==Soup:==

# Heat oil in a large soup pot over medium heat. When hot, use a slotted spoon to lift the chicken out of the marinade and place in the pot, reserving marinade. Cook chicken until opaque, stirring occasionally. 
# Add reserved marinade, vegetable stock and water to the pot, and bring to a [[Cookbook:Boiling|boil]].
# Add onion, sweet potato, potato, plantain, corn, jalapeño, salt and pepper.
# Bring back to a boil, reduce to low and cook partially covered for 1 to 1½ hours.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* To serve, ladle soup into bowls and top with a small scoop of rice, if desired. Pass hot sauce and cilantro at the table.
* Because this soup has a long simmering time, choose an unripe green plantain rather than a ripe yellow or black-colored plantain, which has a softer texture.
* Each cook makes his own recipe for sancocho, combining root vegetables with different kinds of meat, some with up to seven meats.
* To make the soup even more authentic, add a small peeled cubed [[Cookbook:Cassava|yuca root]] to the broth, along with the other vegetables.

'''Ayran''' is a popular Turkish drink made of a yoghurt and water. The ayran made from sheep yoghurt has a quite thick taste, fatty but also delicious. It is very similar to the Iranian drink, Doogh.
Salt is usually added to ayran for flavour. It is served cool, and usually accompanies doner, kebab or pastry. Some forms of fresh ayran include some foam.

In Turkey McDonalds also includes ayran in their standard menu as a local menu addition. Ayran is also very popular elsewhere in the Middle East. In rural areas of Turkey, ayran is offered as a &quot;standard&quot; drink to guests. &quot;We have come to drink your ayran&quot; say the guests.

Another recipe common to Turkey includes finely chopped mint leaves mixed into the Ayran. This variation is particularly popular during summertime in Turkey and is considered very refreshing.
Ayran has become so popular in Turkey that it is often regarded as a separate market in contrast to the juice and soda industries, and is a challenge for &quot;modern&quot; soft-drink companies such as Coca-Cola.

==Ingredients==
* 1½ cup plain [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yoghurt]]
* 1½ cup [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], to taste
* crushed [[Cookbook:Mint|dried mint]] (optional)   

==Preparation==
Pour yoghurt into a bowl and beat until smooth, add water and continue beating until thoroughly blended, or combine in an electric blender and blend until smooth. Season to taste with salt and dried mint. Chill thoroughly and serve in tall glasses, with ice.

'''Cholley''', also '''chole''', '''cholay''', '''white cholay''', '''chana masala''', is a popular and versatile [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Pakistan|Pakistani]] chickpea dish, that is sometimes referred to as chana or channa. It is commonly cooked in Northern India (especially Punjab) and Pakistan for breakfast, but is not limited to the first meal of the day, being regularly found at dinner parties, picnics, wedding receptions and other special events. Cholley features chickpeas, onions, tomatoes and spices, with variations including additions of [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]] (alu). This dish works well with a range of accompaniments including [[Cookbook:Samosa|samosas]], [[Cookbook:Puri|puri]], [[Cookbook:Roti|roti]], [[Cookbook:Naan|naan]], [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] and [[Cookbook:Bhatoora|bhatura]].

''See also: [[Cookbook:Masaledaar chole|Masaledaar chole]]''

==Ingredients==
* 1 tablespoon of [[Cookbook:oil|oil]]
* 1 clove of [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic]]
* 1 teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander seeds]]
* 1 sliced [[Cookbook:onion|onion]]
* 2 chopped [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]] (medium size)
* 2 tsp [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]]
* 1 tablespoon of [[Cookbook:Garam Masala|garam masala]] (spice mix)
* fresh [[Cookbook:Cilantro|coriander leaves]] (as a garnish)
* 500ml of [[Cookbook:water|water]] for cooking
* 500ml of water for soaking the chickpeas overnight
* 250g [[Cookbook:chickpea|chickpea]]s (white chana, i.e. European chickpeas)
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] (to taste).
* optional: 1 tsp each [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin seeds]], [[Cookbook:Nigella|nigella]]

==Procedure==
#To prepare the cholley dish, commence by washing then soaking the chickpeas overnight in water, allowing them to soften somewhat. Once 12 hours have elapsed, drain the water and place the chickpeas in a [[Cookbook:Pressure Cooking|pressure cooker]] or large cooking pot. Add fresh water and salt, then cook until the chickpeas are tender (10 minutes at 15psi in a pressure cooker).
#Subsequently, heat the oil in a thick-based pan. Add the coriander seeds, and optionally the cumin and nigella seeds, cooking them briefly until they crackle. Quickly add the onions, reduce the heat to medium, and [[Cookbook:sautéing|sauté]] until the onions are transparent. Add garam masala, tomato and salt and cook for one minute before adding the boiled chickpeas. 
#Reduce the heat, and allow the cholley to [[Cookbook:simmering|simmer]] for around 15 minutes. Check that the gravy has thickened before removing from the heat. 
#Once done, place the cholley in a serving bowl, add your coriander garnish and serve with [[Cookbook:Samosa|samosas]], [[Cookbook:rice|rice]] or [[Cookbook:bread|bread]].

'''Tahdiq''', or '''tahdig''' is a popular Persian way of preparing rice.

==Ingredients==

*2 medium size [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]
*2 cups [[Cookbook:Basmati rice|basmati rice]]
*⅓ cup [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] (as desired)
*[[Cookbook:Water|water]]

==Procedure==

# Peel and slice the raw potatoes into ½ inch thick slices.
# Rinse and drain rice. Bring 4-5 cups of water to a boil in a 3 qt pot, add salt if desired. Add rice &amp; continue to boil the water, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes. Check to be sure that the rice doesn't cook completely at this point.
# When rice is roughly half cooked, drain into a [[Cookbook:Colander|colander]]. 
# Pour ¼ cup of cooking oil into the pot and lay the potato slices in the bottom close together in a single layer. Add a small amount of salt (if desired). Layer the half cooked, drained rice loosely atop the potatoes. 
# Place pot on stove over medium high heat for 4-5 minutes or until rice begins to steam. 
# Lower heat and add 5 Tbs of water and 2-3 Tbs of oil on top of rice. Cover &amp; let simmer for about ½ hour or until cooked and tender. The higher the heat, the crunchier the Tahdig. 
# Scoop out the rice and use a soft spatula to remove Tahdig at bottom, or try to make the contents of the pot come out as an entire cake of rice on the serving dish.

Tahdig can also be made by substituting the potatoes with bread (for ex. [[Cookbook:Pita|pitta]] or Lavash) or with the rice alone. Other common additions include slices of onion, beet or other rootstock.

Use more [[Cookbook:mayonnaise|mayonnaise]] for a richer, smoother texture. Add about half a spoon of [[Cookbook:mustard|mustard]] or more or less to taste.
Scoop the mixture into the empty egg whites until each is evenly filled. Sprinkle a little dried [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]] on the yolk of each re-filled egg.
Keep covered and refrigerated until ready to consume.

'''Moussaka''' is a [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] minced meat dish, resembling a casserole. For the Greek version of this dish, see [[Cookbook:Greek_Moussaka|Greek Moussaka]].

==Ingredients==
*1/2 kg of minced meat (usually [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] in Bulgaria, but don't hesitate to experiment!)
*1 kg of [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], peeled and finely chopped
*two [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], finely chopped
*[[Cookbook:Parsley|Parsley]], 1/3 cupful, finely chopped
*one [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], finely chopped
*3 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]], beaten
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]]
*2 spoonfuls [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]], to taste
*[[Cookbook:Oil|Oil]] for cooking

==Procedure==
#Fry the onion and the minced meat in a little oil. The more fatty the meat is, the less oil you need. #When it is no longer red, mix it with the potatoes, tomatoes, and parsley. Add salt and pepper to taste. 
#Bake for about 1 hour, or until the potatoes are cooked. 
#Stir the eggs, the yogurt and the flour together and pour it over the dish. Bake for 10 more minutes. It's delicious with cold yogurt on the side. Enjoy!

== Ingredients ==
# 3 organic or unwaxed [[Cookbook:oranges|oranges]] (Sevilles are good)
# 90 g  [[Cookbook:caster sugar|caster sugar]] (twice)
# 220 ml [[Cookbook:water|water]] (twice)

== Instructions ==
You will need to start 3 or 4 days in advance. 

#Peel just the skin of the washed, dried orange with a potato peeler (skin, no white pith). 
#[[Cookbook:Boil|Boil]] this in a syrup made from the sugar and water for 5 minutes. Dry on a wire rack for 4 hours. Boil again in a fresh syrup. Dry again on the wire rack until brittle (about 48 hours).

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}}

This is a basic recipe detailing how to prepare basic '''Roast Chicken'''. The dish is popular worldwide.

==Ingredients==
* 1 [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]], plucked with giblets removed
* 1 [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]], halved
* [[Cookbook:Olive_Oil|Olive Oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] and freshly ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]

== Procedure ==
#Preheat your oven to 200°C (390°F)
#Rub salt in the cavity of the chicken, then insert the two halves of lemon.
#Rub the chicken skin all over with olive oil, then season generously with salt and pepper. Place in a lightly oiled roasting tin.
#Cook your chicken for 20 minutes per 450g (1lb) plus an additional 30 minutes at the end.
#Remove the chicken from the oven, cover loosely with foil and allow to rest for 20 minutes before carving.

==Notes==
#The chicken will be cooked when the juices run clear after it is removed from the oven. To check this, insert a knife tip into through the thickest part of the thigh and, using the flat of the knife, push against the flesh and look at the juice running out of the thigh.

==Techniques to keep the meat moist==
A common problem with roasting chicken is dry breast meat. There are numerous techniques to try and avoid this :-
#Always make sure that your chicken is well rested before carving. Resting allows the juices to go back into the flesh thereby moistening the meat.
#Baste the chicken in the fat that runs from it during cooking.
#Put the chicken in the oven breast side down for the first half an hour of cooking, so that the juice in the chicken runs into the breast. However, this will make it diffiult to crisp the breast skin.
#Cover the breast with rashers of streaky [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]] or [[Cookbook:Pancetta|pancetta]]. The fat in the bacon will cook out into the breast meat underneath.
#You can part the skin from the breast meat prior to cooking. Carefully separate the two with your fingers taking care not to tear the skin. Into the gap between the skin you can insert softened [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] to keep the meat moist. This butter can be flavoured to impart flavour to the meat using chopped bacon, herbs and other seasonings.

'''Zucchini bread''' is a sweet fluffy bread that has zucchini in it. It is delicious. There are many different ways of making it. Here is one. This recipe was derived from the lyrics of a song by a band called Chuga Chuga, from Michigan/Washington, DC, USA. They broke up in 2006.

*2 cups of [[Cookbook:Grater|shredded]] [[Cookbook:Zucchini|zucchini]]
*3 cups of [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]

'''Colonial Goose''' is the name for a surprisingly effective preparation of roast leg of [[Cookbook:lamb|lamb]].

Early colonial pioneers in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of New Zealand|New Zealand]] had [[Cookbook:sheep|sheep]] aplenty, but [[Cookbook:goose|goose]] was relatively scarce. To prepare dishes similar to those they had back home in [[Cookbook:English cuisine|England]] the pioneers were very inventive. Colonial Goose is now a recognised classic, with some restaurants featuring it as a main attraction at midwinter festivities (June 21 in NZ). It involves the careful boning out a leg of lamb, stuffing it with honey and dried apricots, and then marinating it in a red wine based marinade which even gives it the appearance of goose when cooked.

==Ingredients==
You need a large leg of [[Cookbook:lamb|lamb]]. If you don’t know how to bone it out, ask your butcher to do it, stressing that you need to be able to stuff it.

;For the stuffing
* 30g [[Cookbook:butter|butter]]
* 1 large tablespoon clear [[Cookbook:honey|honey]]
* 125g dried [[Cookbook:apricot|apricot]]s, finely [[Cookbook:diced|diced]]
* 1 medium sized [[Cookbook:onion|onion]], finely diced
* 1 cup fresh [[Cookbook:bread crumbs|bread crumbs]]
* quarter teaspoon of [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
* quarter teaspoon of dried [[Cookbook:thyme|thyme]]
* freshly ground [[Cookbook:black pepper|black pepper]]
* 1 beaten [[Cookbook:egg|egg]]

;For the marinade
* 250g sliced [[Cookbook:carrot|carrot]]s
* two large [[Cookbook:onion|onion]]s, sliced
* 1 [[Cookbook:bay leaf|bay leaf]]
* 3 or 4 crushed [[Cookbook:parsley|parsley]] stalks
* not quite full cup of [[Cookbook:red wine|red wine]] such as [[Cookbook:claret|claret]]

==Procedure==
#To prepare the stuffing, melt the butter and honey over low heat, add the other ingredients and combine well. 
#Force the stuffing into the cavity in the meat, and sew it up with fine string. 
#Place the leg into a plastic bag (which sits in a large bowl), and add the marinade mixture.
#The meat is best prepared just after breakfast, so it can then be regularly turned over in the marinade throughout the day. 
#Cook in oven at 180 °C for two hours but check on progress at 90 minutes. If the meat looks like over browning, it can be covered by foil. 
#Remove the string before carving. 
#Strain the marinade and use three or four tablespoons of the liquor to make [[Cookbook:gravy|gravy]].

'''Lolly cake''' is a [[Cookbook:Cuisine of New Zealand|New Zealand]] cake which features [[Cookbook:candy|lollies]] in the ingredients and thus can be thought of as &quot;candy cake&quot;.

The traditional candy used is Fruit Puffs which are like firm, slightly chewy [[Cookbook:marshmallow|marshmallow]]s and are obviously fruity. Malt biscuits and coconut are also used and other ingredients can be added or substituted.

==Ingredients==
* 120 g (1.5 sticks) of [[Cookbook:butter|butter]]
* 250 g of [[Cookbook:malt biscuits|malt biscuits]] (one packet)
* 180 g of [[Cookbook:Fruit Puffs|Fruit Puffs]] (one packet)
* 200 g (1/2 can or 7 ounces) [[Cookbook:condensed milk|condensed milk]]
* shredded [[Cookbook:coconut|coconut]]
* a pinch of [[Cookbook:cinnamon|cinnamon]] (optional)

==Directions==
# Crush the biscuits. They don't need to be a fine dust, some pieces can be left partially smushed to give the cake a nicer texture.
# Mix in cinnamon, if you want it.
# Warm the butter and condensed milk in the [[Cookbook:microwave oven|microwave]] for 30 seconds until the butter is very soft. It's ok if the butter melts a bit.
# Cut the fruit puffs in half if you want or leave them whole.
# Mix the fruit puffs with the crushed biscuits, add the butter and condensed milk. Mix well. 
# Scoop up the mixture and roll it into a log shape, or take small amounts and roll into little balls.
# Roll in the shredded coconut until the log or each ball is completely covered.
# Place on a tray in the refrigerator and wait for it to harden. This takes a few hours. Put plastic wrap over the tray to keep the lolly cake moist.

'''Calentita''' &amp;ndash; the quintessential 'Yanito' dish. Every Gibraltarian knows how to cook calentita! Or so they should, it is a matter of national pride.

It is believed this dish is based on the Genoese '[[Cookbook:Socca|farinata]]' which is cooked thinner and often with toppings whereas calentita is cooked in a deeper pan and is never topped with anything but black pepper.

The name 'calentita' has a most interesting history. When Gibraltarian evacuees returned to Gibraltar after World War II many were forced to live in cramped and often inadequate housing. Not all homes had workable ovens and people cooked mainly Spanish style stews (potajes) and similar dishes. However, the local bakeries took advantage of this and would use their ovens in slack periods to make calentita which was sold by street vendors (this had been the fashion before the war when almost no-one had an oven at home). The calentita would be baked in a large low pan (similar to a frying pan of diameter about 90 cm with two small grab handles) with a metal hinged lid. The vendor would then walk along the streets on the Rock shouting out his wares. His shout would be similar to this: 'La llevo caliente, calentita! Calentita, caliente!' A simple translation would be: 'Hot! Come and get it! I still have it hot!'. Caliente means hot and calentita is an endearing version of hot! Everyone would rush to him and buy a portion which was invariably about 8cm by 5cm and cost 6d (about 2 1/2p  of today's money) and was served on a piece of greaseproof paper. The vendor would sprinkle ground pepper on it and off you went!

== Ingredients ==

* 250g [[Cookbook:Chickpea Flour|chickpea flour]]
* 1 litre [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|Olive oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]

== Procedure ==

# Mix chickpea flour and water and salt/pepper in a bowl. Leave to stand, preferably overnight. 
# Preheat oven to 175°C (350°F). Take a tin 9x6 inches (15x23cms) or oven dish and put enough oil to cover bottom of tin or bowl. Heat in oven. 
# Then spread hot oil up sides of tin with a pastry brush or by tilting. Stir mixture and pour immediately into tin, and put back in oven for about 1 hour approximately or until set in the middle.
# Leave to stand for a while. 
# Good for two or three servings.

'''Rosto''' is a dish is of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian]] origin, and provides for two complete courses cooked in one pot without the need for an oven. Originally the pasta was served as a first course with the tomato sauce over it. This was followed by the sliced meat, usually a cheaper cut of pork instead of loin and a small piece at that, with the potatoes, carrots and mushrooms.

It is still extremely popular although many people nowadays also cook it with chicken thighs or even a piece of beef instead of the traditional pork.

== Ingredients ==
 
* 1 kg [[Cookbook:Pork|Pork]] loin
* 2 [[Cookbook:Carrot|Carrots]]
* 4 [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] cut in quarters
* 1 [[Cookbook:Onion|Onion]], chopped
* ½ kg Penne or Macaroni ([[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]])
* ¼ kg [[Cookbook:Mushroom|Mushrooms]]
* ½ kg Fresh [[Cookbook:Tomato|Tomatoes]]
* 1 tin ‘[[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomate triturado]]’ (tomato paste, or three peeled, de-seeded and puréed tomatoes)
* [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|Pepper]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Garlic|Garlic Clove]]
* [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|Olive Oil]] (To [[Cookbook:Frying|fry]])
* [[Cookbook:Wine|White wine]]
* [[Cookbook:Sugar|Sugar]] to taste
* [[Cookbook:Grater|Grated]] [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]] ([[Cookbook:Edam Cheese|Hard Edam]] or [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan]])

== Procedure ==

# Fry crushed garlic clove and chopped onions till soft. 
# Add tomatoes; fry for five minutes then add pork loin and brown till sealed. 
# Add tin of ‘tomate triturado’ and a dash of white wine. 
# Add potatoes and carrots then cook till meat, potatoes and carrots are done. 
# Add the mushrooms about ten minutes before the end. 
# Add salt, pepper and sugar to taste. 
# Boil the macaroni until ‘al dente’. 
# Remove the meat from the stew and slice.
# Serve meat, potatoes and pasta on same plate pouring sauce over pasta and topping with grated cheese.

'''Torta de acelga''' (Chard pie) is believed to be based on a [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]] pie eaten in parts of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italy]] and is also very similar to the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Greece|Greek]] '[[Cookbook:Spanakopita|spanakopita]]'. This pie is traditionally eaten on [[w:Good Friday|Good Friday]] here in Gibraltar. 

==Ingredients==

* 1 small pkt [[Cookbook:Puff pastry|puff pastry]] (or else make a pastry by mixing one glass each of [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]] and [[Cookbook:Water|water]] then adding [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] until a soft [[Cookbook:Dough|dough]] is achieved)
* 6 bunches of [[Cookbook:Chard|acelga]] (chard)
* 6 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* [[Cookbook:Bread Crumb|Breadcrumbs]]
* [[Cookbook:Grater|Grated]] [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]]
* [[Cookbook:Parsley|Parsley]]
* 2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Mincing|minced]] [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* Season to taste

==Procedure==

# Remove the stems of the acelga (these stems will become useful for another recipe called Potaje de acelga). 
# Wash the leaves very well to remove any grit or soil. Boil the acelga leaves, drain really well and chop them. Fry them for a few minutes in hot olive oil then set aside.
# Roll out the pastry and lay on an oven proof pie dish leaving sufficient pastry to close the pie later. 
# Beat the eggs and add all the ingredients to make a nice filling. 
# Add to the acelga and mix all together. 
# Fill the pie dish with this “relleno” or filling and close the pie with the pastry. 
# Cook in the oven (150°C / 300°F) for about 30 mins or until the pie is nice and golden. 

N.B. I always boil the acelga the night before to save time.

'''Panissa''' &amp;ndash; there is also an original [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian]] one. What is referred to as Panissa in Italy nowadays is more akin to the Gibraltarian '[[Cookbook:Calentita|Calentita]]'.

# Stir the chick pea flour into 2 litres of lightly salted water over a moderate flame, and stir the mixture steadily in the same direction with a wooden spoon until you obtain a soft, lump-free paste. 
# When the paste begins to pull away from the sides of the pot, turn it out into oiled wooden moulds, or spread it out about ¼ inch high (½ cm) on your work surface (dust the surface with parsley before you spread if you're including it). 
# Alternatively pour into saucers and cut into wedges when set.
# Once the paste has cooled, cut it into 1 by 3-inch (3x7 cm) rectangles and fry them in hot oil.

'''Rolitos'''

==Ingredients==

* 8 slices thinly sliced [[Cookbook:Veal|veal]]
* 4 slices of [[Cookbook:Ham|ham]] cut in halves
* 2 [[Cookbook:Hard Boiled Eggs|hard boiled eggs]] cut into quarters
* 8 [[Cookbook:Olive|Olives]] (''con morrones'' - stuffed with peppers) cut in halves
* 1 crushed or chopped [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic clove]]
* 1 chopped [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Stock|beef stock]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* [[w:Bisto|Bisto]] (as required)

==Procedure==
# Lay out one slice of veal on worktop; place on it half a slice of ham, quarter egg and two olive halves. 
# Carefully roll up the veal to make a package or roll with everything inside. Use two toothpicks to hold the roll together. 
# Place rolls on a plate and store in a cool place or fridge.
# Fry garlic and onions till soft. 
# Add stock and two teaspoons of Bisto and bring to boil. 
# Carefully place veal rolls into the boiling mixture being careful not to break them up. 
# Lower heat and simmer till done. If sauce is too thin add Bisto till the right consistency is achieved. 

This meal is traditionally served with mashed potatoes. There is an alternative method made with a tomato sauce instead of brown gravy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Southern cuisine|Southern cuisine (USA)]] | [[Cookbook:Fried Chicken|Fried Chicken]]

'''Fried chicken''' has a dual origin in the rural American South. The Scots had a tradition of shallow cooking chicken in fat (not quite pan frying), unlike their English counterparts who baked or boiled chicken. Later, as African slaves were introduced to households as cooks, seasonings and spices were added that are absent in traditional Scottish cuisine, improving the flavor and they brought the concept of deep fat frying. Since slaves were often allowed to keep only chickens, frying chicken as a special occasion spread through the African American community. After slavery, poor rural southern blacks continued the tradition since chickens were often the only animals they could afford to raise. Since fried chicken could keep for several days, it travelled well, and also gained favor during segregation when blacks normally could not find places to eat and had to carry their own food. Southern whites also continued the tradition of frying chicken. While not limited like blacks socially, poor whites were no better off economically. Therefore, fried chicken continued to dominate as &quot;Sunday dinner&quot; or on other special occasions.

==Ingredients==

*1 fryer [[Cookbook:chicken|chicken]], cut up (see notes below)
*1 quart [[Cookbook:milk|buttermilk]]
*½ cup [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
*[[Cookbook:Spice rub|Spice rub]] (Paprika is highly recommended. See below for how to prepare)
*[[Cookbook:Flour|Flour]]
*A quantity of [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] suitable for the desired cooking method (see notes below)

==Procedure==
===Preparing the spice rub===
#Put a large amount of the spice in a bowl. 
#Add slightly less of some other seasonings, such as [[Cookbook:pepper|pepper]]. Mix it up. You now have a spice rub.

===Brining the chicken===
#Pour the buttermilk into a bowl and dissolve ½ cup of salt in the buttermilk.
#Piece by piece, roll the chicken around in the spice rub.
#Submerge each chicken piece in the buttermilk.
#Cover the bowl of buttermilk and chicken and refrigerate. (You can get by with as few as two hours if you are in a hurry, but the flavor will suffer. You can also park it overnight, but you should reduce the salt to ⅓ of a cup)
#Shortly before you want to cook the chicken, remove it from the buttermilk and drain. Roll it around in flour so that it is well covered in flour. Shake off the excess flour.

===Cooking the chicken, deep frying method===
#The safest cooking method is [[Cookbook:Deep Fat Frying|deep frying]]. Immerse chicken in 360°F oil. Cooking times are:
#*Breasts: 10 minutes
#*Drumsticks: 12 minutes
#*Thighs: 13-14 minutes
#*Wings: 10 minutes (though wings are often better suited to other applications)
#Drain the chicken on a wire rack (place it over a sheet pan to catch the oil).

===Variation 1, pan frying method===
#The most traditional cooking method is [[Cookbook:Pan Frying|pan frying]] in a [[Cookbook:Cast iron|cast iron skillet]]. Care must be taken to avoid spilling and splattering.
#Heat enough oil (or shortening) to come 3-4mm up the side of the pan to 325°F.
#Carefully place chicken in pan, skin side down, and cook until brown, 10-12 minutes. Turn over and cook other side.
#Doing this will require some careful placement in the pan so as to cook the slow-cooking meat (such as thighs) more intensely than the fast-cooking meat (such as wings and breasts).
#Drain the chicken on a wire rack (place it over a sheet pan to catch the oil).

===Variation 2, pressure frying method===
#[[Cookbook:Pressure frying|Pressure frying]] gives excellent results, but special equipment is needed. A typical pressure cooker is not suitable for cooking with large quantities of oil; a pressure fryer must be used. Follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully.
#Put the chicken pieces into hot oil (larger pieces first) and fry about 3 minutes until very light brown. Then put on the lid and lock it.
#Cook at a pressure of 5-6 pounds for about 7 minutes.
#Drain the chicken on a wire rack (place it over a sheet pan to catch the oil).

==Notes, Tips, and Variations==
*The key to this recipe is the buttermilk brine, which seasons the chicken with a salty tanginess inside. Combined with a suitably zingy spice rub, this works out beautifully.
*This recipe is death to oil, so it's one you might want to save until you're thinking about changing your fryer oil anyway.
*As with all respectable fried chicken recipes, this recipe may be even better 24 hours after you cook it, when the chicken has been refrigerated.
*If you can get a pre-cut chicken, this is  ultimately easier. Alternatively, if you have a real preference for drumsticks, thighs, breasts, or some other part, feel free to buy just those. The quantities in the ingredient list, however, reflect two breasts, two thighs, and two drumsticks. (Don't waste the other parts on fried chicken; save them for chicken soup! But if you like fried chicken wings, increase the quantities a bit.)
*If you are kosher, lactose intolerant, not fond of buttermilk, or feeling experimental, feel free to play around with other possible brines here. If you use a less [[Wikipedia:viscous|viscous]] liquid than buttermilk, however, you may need to use an egg wash to make sure that the flour sticks to the chicken in sufficient quantity.
*Wings can also be saved, along with other leftover bits of carcass, to make [[Cookbook:Chicken Soup|chicken soup]].
*Personal preference chooses which spice to use as a base. A [[Cookbook:paprika|paprika]] based rub works very well for this recipe, but others will work just fine. [[Cookbook:Cumin|Cumin]] or [[Cookbook:Curry Powder|curry powder]] would also both be good choices.

'''Shirmal''', also '''sheermal''', is a traditional [[Cookbook:Flatbread|flatbread]] made by Muslims in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Pakistan|Pakistan]] and in the [[w:Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]] region of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]], probably from Persian influences.

==Ingredients==

* 3 cups [[Cookbook:Flour|plain flour]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 2 tbsp. [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] extra
* 1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* ¾ cup [[Cookbook:Ghee|ghee]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste
* a few [[Cookbook:Saffron|saffron strands]]

==Procedure==

# Soak saffron strands in 2 tbsp. milk warmed. Keep aside.
# Sift together flour and salt, sprinkle in sugar. 
# Take in a large bowl, add melted ghee. Run in ghee with finger until evenly distributed.
# Add milk a little at a time, and knead in dough. When it forms a soft smooth lump, cover with moist cloth.
# Keep aside for 2 hours, knead, keep aside again for 2 hours. Knead again, divide into 7 parts.
# Rub saffron strands in milk to dissolve.
# Place an inverted heavy iron pan on lower shelf of oven. Keep the grill on upper rack. Preheat to 250°C (480°F).
# Use dry flour for dusting while rolling. Roll to thick round about 6&quot; in diameter. Prick with fork all over. Slap onto pan base.
# Allow to bake until brown spots appear.
# Move to grill with tongs. Dip fingers in saffron milk and splash on sheermal. Keep in oven few more seconds.
# Or, bake in traditional [[Cookbook:Tandoor|tandoor]] or in inverted [[Cookbook:Pressure Cooking|pressure cooker]].
# Remove, serve hot or wrap in slightly moist towel to collect.

Apply butter or ghee on top if desired. Serve with gravies, veggies, curds, pickles or jams.

'''Momos''' are a kind of [[Cookbook:Dumpling|dumpling]] popular in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Nepal|Nepal]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Sikkim]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Tibet|Tibet]], and are similar to [[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|Chinese]] [[Cookbook:Potsticker|potstickers]]. 

Momos are made of a simple flour and water dough. White flour is generally preferred, and sometimes a little yeast or baking soda is added to give a more 'doughy' texture to the finished product. The filling may be one of several mixtures, described below:

*[[Cookbook:Mincing|Minced]] [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]], or beef and [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]], combined with any or all of the following: [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], [[Cookbook:Shallot|shallots]], [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], and [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro (coriander leaves)]]. The mixture is usually spiced with [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]], and often ground [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]]. Some people also add finely [[Cookbook:Purée|puréed]] [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], though many variations are possible.
*[[Cookbook:Vegetarian cuisine|Vegetarian]], predominantly made from onions and cabbage, and frequently curried. Finely diced vegetables are also added, as well as various spices.
*[[Cookbook:Potato|Potato]], somewhat similar to Indian [[Cookbook:Samosa|samosas]], with small dice of firm potato in a tomato based sauce.
*[[Cookbook:Cheese|Cheese]], usually a fresh cheese, this variety is common in Sikkim.
These fillings are then enclosed in a round of the above dough, which is sealed in a circular fashion, resembling a pinwheel, though it's also not uncommon for them to be folded in half and sealed.

The resulting dumplings are then cooked by [[Cookbook:Steaming|steaming]] over a soup (either a stock based on bones or tomato-based), which is served with the dumplings, as well as chilli sauce.

# Prepare 1 inch dough balls and roll between your palms to spherical shape.
# Dust working board with dry flour. On the board gently flatten the ball with rolling pin to about 2 inch diameter circle.
# Repeat steps 3-4 again for more wrappers.

===Packing Dumpling===
# Hold wrapper on one palm. Put about 1 spoon of filling in middle of wrapper.
# With the other hand bring all edges together to center, making the pleats. Pinch and twist the pleats to ensure the absolute closure of the dumpling. Closing the meat inside wrapper is the secret of tasty and juicy dumplings.

===Steaming Dumplings===
# Heat up water in steamers.
# Oil the steamer rack well or put cabbage leaves on bottom to prevent dumplings from sticking to rack. Put dumpling in steamer.
# When water boils, close the lid on rack.
# Steaming until the dumplings are cooked through, about 10-15 minutes.

{{recipe|Out of Salad Dressing Salad Dressing}} | [[Cookbook:Sauces|Sauces]]

&quot;This is a recipe I created when I realized that our bottled salad dressing was frozen and couldn't thaw quickly enough. It is very easy to make from ingredients usually already on hand. You can vary the amounts, or even substitute low-fat ingredients according to your personal taste. Tastes even better when chilled over night!&quot;

==Ingredients==
* 1 1/2 [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemons]], juiced 
* 1 cup freshly grated [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan cheese]]
* 2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Garlic Salt|garlic salt]]
* 3/4 cup [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]

==Procedure==
# Mix together lemon juice, Parmesan cheese, garlic salt, and mayonnaise until smooth. Stir in milk, adjusting the amount or adding a little water, to make the dressing as thin or thick as you like. Cover and refrigerate 8 hours, or overnight.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* Instead of garlic salt, crush a clove of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] and mix into the dressing with a little [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] (to taste).

'''Kugelis''' (also ''bulvių plokštainis'', the lexically correct non-foreign name, literally &quot;flat potato dish&quot;, or ''banda'', a dialecticism frequent especially in the [[w:Dzūkija|Dzūkija]] region) is a baked potato pudding that is a [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Lithuania|Lithuanian]] dish.  Its main ingredients are potatoes, bacon, milk, onions, and eggs. It may be spiced with salt, black pepper, [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaves]], and/or [[Cookbook:Marjoram|marjoram]]. It is usually eaten with sour cream and/or crumbled fried fat white bacon (''spirgai'').

==Ingredients==
*5 lbs. [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], peeled and [[Cookbook:Grater|grated]] (or ground with a [[Cookbook:Food Processor|food processor]]) 
*2 med. [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], grated 
*1 lb. [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]], fried and crumbled (reserve about ¼ cup drippings) 
*1 [[Cookbook:Butter|stick of butter]], melted 
*6 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
*1 lg. can [[Cookbook:Evaporated milk|evaporated milk]]
*4 tsp. [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*[[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste (about a teaspoon) 
 
==Preparation==
# Peel and grate or grind (with a fine disc) potatoes and onions. Do not drain.
# Fry and crumble bacon, add to potatoes and onions, along with ¼ cup drippings. Mix well.
# Beat well 6 eggs, add evaporated milk, melted butter, salt and pepper, and mix well.
# Add egg mixture to potato mixture, and mix together.
# Pour into a well greased 9x13 cake pan (yes, it'll fit &amp;ndash; barely).
# Bake at 350°F (175°C) for 90 minutes.

To serve: slice into squares, and top with [[Cookbook:Sour Cream|sour cream]] ([[Cookbook:Applesauce|applesauce]] is also suitable).

Leftovers are best reheated sliced thin and [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sautéed]] in melted butter. Kugelis also reheats well in the [[Cookbook:Microwave Oven|microwave]] and freezes well.

Soup alla Nazionale

Ingredients:  [[Clear soup]], savoury [[custard]].

Make a savoury custard and divide it into three parts, one to be left white, another coloured red with tomato, and the third green with spinach.  Put a layer of each in a buttered saucepan and cook for about ten minutes, cut it into dice, so that you have the three Italian colours (red, white, and green) together, then put the custard into a soup tureen and pour a good clear soup over it.

:''This article is about '''döner kebab'''. There is also another type of kebab called [[Cookbook:Shish kebab|shish kebab]].''

'''Döner [[Cookbook:Kebab|kebab]]''' ('''döner kebap''' in Turkish) literally means &quot;rotating grilled meat&quot; (any type of meat applies). First döner kebabs developed in Berlin by Turkish immigrants for the sake of fitting the food and taste Germans are used to. Authentic Turkish döner is made from lamb; regardless, mostly beef or a mix of beef and lamb is used in Europe. This article has the recipe for a complete European-style pita kebab.

==Meat==
Although frozen kebab is available at convenient stores, they don't match fresh home-made kebab and may not be consistent with your taste and spicing.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Ingredients (four-pounder)'''
&lt;br /&gt;
* ''2 [[Cookbook:Kg|kg]] (4½ [[Cookbook:Pound|lb.]])'' of [[Cookbook:Minced Meat|ground beef]] (or other [[Cookbook:Mincing|minced]] meat)
* ''11-12 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbsp.]]'' of [[Cookbook:chicken salt|chicken salt]] 
* ''6 tbsp.'' of [[Cookbook:black pepper|black pepper]] (amount depends on taste preference)
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Two-pounder portion'''
&lt;br /&gt;
* ''1 kg (2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; lb.)'' of ground beef (or other minced meat)
* ''5½ tbsp.'' of chicken salt
* ''3 tbsp.'' of black pepper (amount depends on taste preference)
&lt;br /&gt;
'''One-pounder portion'''
&lt;br /&gt;
* ''500 [[Cookbook:Gram|g]] (1 lb.)'' of ground beef (or other minced meat)
* ''2½-3 tbsp.'' of chicken salt
* ''1½ tbsp.'' of black pepper (amount depends on taste preference)
&lt;br /&gt;
''If you want, you can add other spices like [[Cookbook:Chile pepper|chili]], [[Cookbook:Cayenne pepper|cayenne]], [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], [[Cookbook:Barbecue|BBQ]] sauces etc.''
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'''Preparation'''&lt;br /&gt;
# [[Cookbook:Mix|Mix]] all the ingredients into a [[Cookbook:Farce|farce]]-like chunk. 
# Use a [[Cookbook:mixer|mixer]] or your hands to get air out of the chunk. 
# Optionally, you can make a hole with a knife to the chunk so that excess fat can drain out. 
# Wrap it ''tightly'' in [[Cookbook:Aluminum foil|aluminum foil]], and use more than two layers of foil (so it will not rupture). 
# Put it into the oven and set the temperature to 100&amp;nbsp;°[[Cookbook:C|C]] (210&amp;nbsp;°[[Cookbook:F|F]]). 
# Let it cook for 4 hours. 
#:''Note: 4 hours applies to any size. Let's say, if you want a 1 kg chunk (half of the original portion), you should NOT leave it for 2 hours, 4 hours apply for every size. The idea is that it gets cooked slowly.''
#When it is done, remove it from the oven, open the foil, and let it cool down. If you did everything correctly, you should be able to use a shredder or a knife to cut it in thin slices.

==Sauce==
Kebab is never perfect without sauce or a dressing! Here are a couple of sauces that go with kebab:
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
'''Iskender-style dressing'''
* ''2-3 [[Cookbook:Deciliter|dl]] (&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-1&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]])'' of unseasoned [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]]
* ''1-3 cloves'' of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], chopped (amount depends on preference)
* ''[[Cookbook:Pinch|pinch]]'' of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* ''1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp.]]'' of [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]]
* ''1-1½ tsp.'' of black and/or white [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]

(''Optional seasoning for taste'')
* green-, lemon-, or red pepper
* [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chile pepper]]/chili powder
* [[Cookbook:Pepper|cayenne pepper]]
* [[Cookbook:Tabasco|Tabasco sauce]]
&lt;br/&gt;
'''Tomato sauce dressing'''
* ''1 can'' of [[Cookbook:Tomato purée|tomato purée]] ''(70 g or 2½ [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz.]])''
* ''½-1 tsp. of salt
* ''½-1½ tsp.'' of white pepper
* ''½-1½ tsp.'' of black pepper
* ''1 tsp.'' of basil
* ''pinch'' of [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]]
* [[Cookbook:Ketchup|ketchup]] (amount depends on preference)

==Pita==
:''Main article: [[Cookbook:Pita|Pita]]''
You can either wrap the fillings into a reel or make it into a sandwich, with pita bread.
You may want to make the pita slightly thinner if wrapping into a reel. If you want a relatively big kebab, then make the breads into a diameter of about 30 cm (12&quot;).
Pita Bread is more popular to Lebanese Bread

==Salad==
A salad consisting of tomatoes, pickles, cucumbers, and Chinese cabbage with mayonnaise is probably the most common salad eaten with kebab in Europe. There are tons of variations, of course. If you want a healthy choice, make sure you balance the cereals class (pita), meat class (kebab), and vegetable class (salad) well! You can also add chile peppers, jalapeño, red onions and such for the salad to fit your taste!

==Serving==
There are several ways and styles to serve döner. Here are a few:
* '''Sandwich-style''' &lt;br/&gt;Slice the pita bread from the middle, then lay the salad, kebab and dressings like you would do with a [[Cookbook:Hamburger|hamburger]].
* '''Reel-kebab''' &lt;br/&gt; The roll wrap for a reel-kebab can be done using the [http://www.cuisinemag.com/main/videos/50-rollingBurritos.php same technique] as for burritos (using pita bread).
* '''Kebab pizza''' &lt;br/&gt; Simply prepare a pizza and top it with kebab.
* '''Kebab with rice''' &lt;br/&gt; Fill roughly over a half of a plate with kebab, and the rest with cooked rice. Dress with ketchup or any of the sauce recipes mentioned in this article.
* '''Kebab with chips''' &lt;br/&gt; Same as ''kebab with rice'' except that the rice has been replaced by chips (a.k.a French fries).

==Drink==
Although it is obvious that the drink which one chooses is a matter of taste. Regardless, you should always remember in case you prepare really hot food and do not wish to burn your tongue, that milk, in fact, is an effective &quot;anti-heat&quot; agent, in case you think you may need one.

[[Cookbook:Roti|Roti]], in general, refers to the Indian [[Cookbook:Flatbread|flatbread]] cooked on an iron griddle ([[Cookbook:Tava|tava]]). '''Makki di roti''' refers to a special roti in which, unlike the usual [[Cookbook:Flour#Wheat Flour|wheat flour]], [[Cookbook:Cornmeal|cornmeal]] is used. The name &quot;makki di roti&quot; literally means &quot;roti made from cornmeal&quot;.

Makki roti is yellow in color when ready, and has much less adhesive strength, which makes it difficult to handle. Due to this, cooking makki roti is much more difficult than ordinary (wheat) roti. 

Makki roti is cooked in [[w:Punjab region|Punjab]] in the winters and is a world famous delicacy from the north-Indian state, especially together with [[Cookbook:Saron Da Saag|saron da saag]] or sarson ka saag (cooked mustard leaves) and [[Cookbook:Lassi|lassi]].

==Ingredients==

*a cupped handful of [[Cookbook:Cornmeal|cornmeal]] for each serving
*a spoonful of soft [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] (best to have unsalted homemade butter)
*a cupful of lukewarm [[Cookbook:Water|water]]

==Equipment==

*flat iron griddle ([[Cookbook:Tava|tahva]]), preheated
*rolling pin (bailna) and flat board (chakla)
*wide flat mixing tray ([[praant]])
*cooking fire on which the tahva will be heated

==Procedure==

# Place the measured quantity of cornmeal in a praant (a wide flat mixing tray). Heap up the cornmeal to form a hill.  Make a well, and pour in a small quantity of the lukewarm water.
# Start to mix the cornmeal and water into a dough. The dough should remain moist but not become sticky. Add water in small quantities to retain a moist feel. The final dough should not be sticky (sprinkle some extra cornmeal to help soak up excess moisture).
# Add the soft butter (makhan) at the end and give it a final kneading. Leave the dough covered with a dry cloth for about 30 minutes before continuing.
# Take a small hand-sized portion of the dough from the mixing tray and roll it into a small ball (ladu) between the two hands. Gradually start to flatten the ball between the palms of the two hands (wet the hands and fingers to help the dough to stretch). At the same time rotate the flattening dough so that the thinning of the roti is even. It may start to crack at the edges. Repair any cracks by pressing them at the rims. Wetting the fingers and the palm of the hand will help to spread and give the roti a circular shape. Aim for an evenly thinned roti.
# When the roti is about the size of a small plate (or a little larger then a spread-out hand) place it on the preheated tahva. Leave the roti to take in the heat (it takes a while for roti to get cooked). Some areas of the roti will change in colour as the water evaporates. Soon after, the roti will be able to be moved on the tahva. With a dry cloth, press the areas of the roti that look moist.
# It is a matter of judgement when the roti can be turned over and heated on the other side. When the roti have been well cooked they should not have any moist looking areas. Some areas will have burned slightly but this is normal.
# The roti can be heated on open flames of the cooker. This process of placing roti on open flames is called rodhni. It takes time to get the thick roti to be well cooked.
# The cooked roti is smeared with some butter. This is called &quot;chopadni&quot;. The roti is then put into a serving dish. Traditionally, the roti is served as it gets prepared and is eaten fresh. On occasions when it has to be stored before serving it is placed in a dry tray called &quot;chaba&quot;.

* 1 [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]

* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste

== Procedure ==
# Mince the liver and onions together into a mixing bowl.

# Bake in an oven for approximately 30 minutes.

=== Optional ===
The juices in the tin can be combined with boiling water and flour to make gravy to accompany the faggots.

Black Bean Soup with Tomato-Tomatillo Salsa

==Ingredients==

Soup:
* 1 [[Cookbook:Pound|pound]] dried [[Cookbook:Black Beans|black beans]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Onion|large onions]], [[Cookbook:Dice|finely diced]]
* 4 to 6 [[Cookbook:Garlic|cloves garlic]], minced
* 6 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Water|cold water]]
* 1 cup peeled, seeded and chopped [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]] (fresh or canned)
* Small sprig fresh or dried epazote (optional)
* 1 tablespoon finely chopped canned chipotle chile (or ¼ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Cayenne Pepper|cayenne pepper]], more to taste)
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Cumin|ground cumin seed]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Coriander|ground coriander]]
* 2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Kosher|kosher]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

Salsa:
* 1 large tomato, finely diced
* 3 medium tomatillos, husks removed and finely diced
* 1 small red onion, very finely diced
* 1 serranos or [[Cookbook:Jalapeño|jalopeño]] chile, very finely diced
* ¼ cup roughly chopped fresh [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro leaves]]
* Salt, to taste
* Crème fraîche or [[Cookbook:Sour Cream|sour cream]], for [[Cookbook:Garnish|garnish]]

==Directions==

Soup:
# Pick over the beans. Soak, if desired and drain.
# In a deep, heavy-based pot, heat oil over medium heat.
# Add onions and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.
# Add beans, garlic and water.
# Bring to a [[Cookbook:Boil|boil]], skimming any foam that rises to the surface.
# Reduce to a [[Cookbook:simmer|simmer]] and when the beans are soft, after about 1 hour, add tomato, epazote, chipotle chile, cumin, coriander and salt.
# Cook until the beans start to break down and broth begins to thicken.
# Taste for seasoning; add salt and pepper if needed.

Salsa:
# In a small bowl, combine tomato, tomatillo, onion, jalapeno and cilantro.
# Taste for seasoning and add salt as needed.

Together:
# Ladle soup into individual serving bowls.
# Garnish each with a spoonful of Crème fraîche and salsa.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* If you're serving this soup immediately, you can thicken it by [[Cookbook:Puree|pureeing]] a cup or two of the beans in a [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]] or [[Cookbook:Food Processor|food processor]] and then recombining them with the rest of the soup. If refrigerated overnight, the soup will thicken on its own.
* The salsa will taste best if assembled no more than an hour before serving.
* Epazote is an herb that looks like a weed and is regularly used in Mexican cooking. If you can't find it, use an equal amount of cilantro.
* Tomatillos look like rock hard tomatoes with papery skin. Look for them canned in the Hispanic section of your market, if you can't find fresh. They will be perfectly acceptable.
* Crème fraîche is similar to sour cream, but richer. Look for it in the fancy cheese section.

Famous No-Knead Bread

*This recipe has circled the Internet faster than an African get-rich-quick scam, since it appeared in the ''New York Times'' in November, 2006,  and has been translated into German and Togo.
*The original recipe came from Jim Lahey, owner of Sullivan Street Bakery in Manhattan. It lets time, instead of you, do the work. Simply stir together the ingredients, and let the mixture sit for 18 hours. After brief handling, it sits for 2 to 3 hours more, then bakes in a covered cast-iron pot in a 450 degree oven.
*It should result in a round, rustic loaf, with a chewy crust and an interior with irregularly shaped holes, not fine-textured, but similar to an Italian ciabatta. It's tasty and makes great crostini.

==Ingredients== 

* 3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] all-purpose or bread [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* ¼ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]]
* 2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 5/8 cups warm tap [[Cookbook:Water|water]]

==Directions==

# In a large bowl combine flour, yeast, and salt.
# Add water and stir until blended. ''The dough will be shaggy and sticky.''
# Cover bowl with plastic wrap.
# Let dough rest at least 12 hours, preferably 18 hours, at warm room temperature, about 70 degrees F.
# When the surface is dotted with bubbles, lightly flour a work surface or silicone mat and place dough on it.
# Sprinkle it with a little more flour, and fold it over on itself once or twice.
# Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest 15 minutes.
# Using just enough flour to keep dough from sticking to the work surface and your fingers, gently and quickly shape the dough into a ball.
# Generously coat a lint-free linen towel with flour. ''Not a terrycloth towel.''
# Put the dough seam side down on the towel and dust with more flour.
# Cover with another lint-free linen towel and let rise for 2 to 3 hours. ''Dough will be more than double in size and will not readily spring back when poked with a finger.''
# At least half an hour before baking, place a 3 to 4 quart heavy covered pot (cast iron, enamel, Pyrex, or ceramic) in the oven and preheat to [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|450°F]].
# When the dough is ready, carefully remove the pot from the oven.
# Slide your hand under the towel and turn the dough over into the pot. seam side up. ''It may look like a mess, but that's okay.''
# Shake the pan once or twice if the dough is unevenly distributed; it will straighten out as it bakes.
# Cover with lid and bake 30 minutes.
# Remove the lid and bake 15 to 30 minutes more, until the loaf is beautifully browned.
# Remove the loaf from the pot and cool on a rack.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* If you can't find a pot, look in a neighborhood hardware store.
* You can substitute up to 50% whole-wheat flour, but much more and the texture will suffer.
* Add herbs or other seasoning when initially mixing the dough.
* Use wheat bran or corn meal to coat the towels, if desired.
* If the pot has handles, remove them if they are not heat-resistant.
* Use sturdy oven mitts.
* Before removing the heated pot from the oven, place 2 or 3 cooling racks on the counter.
* Do not place the superheated pot on the counter or anything else you don't want to scorch.

'''Ma'amoul''' are pastries filled with dates or nuts.

==Ingredients==
* 1 lb. (500 g) [[Cookbook:Flour|plain white flour]] (up to a quarter of the flour may be replaced with fine [[Cookbook:Semolina|semolina]])
* 2 tbsp. [[Cookbook:Sugar|white sugar]]
* ½ lb. (250 g) unsalted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] (Normandy butter is best)
* 1-2 tbsp. [[Cookbook:Rosewater|rose water]] or [[Cookbook:Orange#Oranges in Cooking|orange flower water]]
* 2 tbsp. [[Cookbook:Water|water]] or [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* [[Cookbook:Powdered Sugar|icing sugar]]
* pinch of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] (optional)
* [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]] (optional)

===Pistachio filling===

Mix ½ lb. (250 g) finely chopped [[Cookbook:Pistachio|pistachios]] with a somewhat smaller weight of sugar and 1 tbsp. rose water.  (You can use ground [[Cookbook:Almond|almonds]] instead of pistachios.)

===Walnut filling===

Mix ½ lb. (250 g) finely chopped [[Cookbook:Walnut|walnuts]] with a somewhat smaller weight of sugar and 1 tbsp. [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]].

===Date filling===

Chop 1 lb. (500 g) stoneless [[Cookbook:Date|dates]], and bring to the boil with half a teacup of water, squashing the mixture against the side of the pan with a wooden spoon until approximately uniform in consistency.  Blend with an electric chopper if desired.  One variant is to add some butter to the mixture as it cooks.  Allow to cool.

==Equipment==

Ma'amoul may be made in special wooden moulds.  These should be oiled and wiped, then dusted with flour before use (and after every three to four balls, to prevent sticking).  There are three shapes of mould.  The flattish circular shape is used for date ma’amoul; the round domed shape for walnut ma’amoul; the long oval for pistachio ma’amoul.

Some families do not use moulds, but have special crimping tweezers for making patterns on the top of the pastry.  Alternatively, a fork may be used.

==Procedure==
# Sift the flour into a mixing bowl.    Mix with 2 tablespoons white sugar, and a pinch of salt if desired. Some people add a very small quantity of baking powder.
# Work in the butter until the consistency is as uniform as possible; one way is to heat the butter in the microwave first until it is nearly melted, and then mix it with the flour into a sort of crumble.  Cover and leave for some hours or overnight (not in the fridge, or it will go rock hard).
# Break up the dough with your fingers and add the rose water or orange flower water and 2 tbsp. water or milk until it is malleable, and knead the whole into a smooth ball. 
# Take a walnut-sized ball of the dough, stick your thumb into it and hollow out into a cup shape, so that the walls are as thin as possible without breaking. 
# Insert filling to about three-quarters full, and pinch the aperture closed.  Pat gently into a ball, not letting the walls break. 
# Repeat until all the dough and the filling is used.  If at any stage the remaining dough shows signs of drying out, knead in a little more water or milk.  
# Decorate the balls on top with tweezers or the prongs of a fork.  Alternatively, pat each one into a wooden mould and flatten the exposed bottom surface, then bang the mould face down on the work surface to extract the moulded pastry. 
# Place the pastries on a baking sheet (not greased, as the dough is already very buttery) and bake in a preheated oven (180°C / 355°F; 160°C if a fan oven) for 20 minutes: they must not be allowed to become hard or brown.  In fact they should look a little moist and underdone when removed from the oven: they will steam off and harden as they cool.
# Leave the pastries to cool, and dust with icing sugar when cold.  Keep in a sealed plastic box or biscuit tin.

==Karabij==

One variant, used on very special occasions, is known as ''karabij''.  Make nut ma’amoul, using water rather than milk and no flower water, in the form of balls rather than in a mould, leaving them smooth without making any indentations.  Arrange in a pyramid and serve with a special cream called ''naatiffe''.  This is made by boiling water, lemon juice, orange flower water and ground soapwort (''Saponaria officinalis'') into a syrup, and folding in stiffly beaten egg whites.  (Some books mention ''bois de Panama'' instead of soapwort, but apparently this is a fallacy.)

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Cuisine of Italy]]

'''Ciceri e Tria''' is the most beloved dish of [[w:Salento|Salento]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italy]]. It's a brothy pasta dish, with the addition of chickpeas. A third of the pasta is fried, the rest boiled directly into the broth. Its brothiness varies and sometimes you'll be given a spoon with it, sometimes you won't. Cheese is always absent. The addition of the fried pasta was meant to mimic the texture of meat, back when it was scarce. 

==Ingredients==
* [[Cookbook:Chickpea|chickpeas]]
* [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]], [[Cookbook:Dice|diced]] finely
* [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], diced finely
* [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]], diced finely
* [[Cookbook:Barley|barley flour]]
* [[Cookbook:Flour#Wheat Flour|hard durum wheat flour]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chilli peppers]]
* [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]], diced
* [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaves]]
* [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]

==Procedure==

# Soak the chickpeas overnight.
# Drain the chickpeas and add to a large pot with fresh water. Add the vegetables, bay leaves and salt and simmer until tender.
# Meanwhile, make the pasta, by adding roughly 30% barley flour to the 70% hard durum wheat flour and water until you reach pasta consistency. Roll out into thin ribbons, several times thicker than egg pasta allows. Dry a few hours. 
# Take a third of the pasta and fry in small batches, in extra virgin olive oil.
# Regulate water, bring the chickpeas to a boil again, and add the raw pasta.
# Cook until tender, around 3 minutes. Add fried pasta, the diced parsley and a good glug of raw oil.

Serve in bowls.

''OK, you've heard of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, and you've heard of peanut butter toast. Why not combine them?!''

==Ingredients==

* 1 slice of [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]
* 2-4 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Peanut Butter|peanut butter]], smooth or crunchy, whatever you like.
* 1-2 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounces]] [[Cookbook:Chocolate Chips|chocolate chips]]

==Procedure==

# [[Cookbook:toast|Toast]] the bread in a [[Cookbook:Oven|toaster oven]], using the broiler, one side, then the other.
# Smear the peanut butter on the bread. ''C'mon, now, this is not rocket science!''
# Sprinkle chocolate chips lightly (or heavily, if you want!) on the peanut butter.
# Put the toast back under the broiler for about 20 seconds.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* If you don't like this, there's sompin' wrong wich-ya!
* Some people like to spread the chocolate chips, after softening under the broiler.
  A variation that I like is to spread Marshmallow Fluff over the peanut butter and replace the chocolate chips with a Nestles crunch bar, and I use 2 toasts and make it a sandwich.
Just a thought, if you are not actually using Reese's cups then you don't need that in the title, but then, why aren't we using the Reese's?  Yumm!

==Uses==

* I like it for late breakfast, but there ''NEVER'' has to be a reason for chocolate!

# Remove bones and skin from chicken and discard.  Cut chicken into strips 1 cm wide and 3 cm long. 
# Add chicken and peas to soup and simmer for 5 minutes.  Slice the carrots into .5 cm thick rounds and add back into soup. Salt to taste.
# Serve hot with garnishes available.

==Notes, tips, and variations==

* If soup is too thick add boiling water in small amounts; the consistency should be like that of heavy cream.  Soup will thicken as it cools.

'''Chicken and Corn Empanadas'''&lt;br&gt;
''Empanadas, which come from the Spanish word for &quot;bread,&quot; are baked or fried turnovers made from bread, pastry, phyllo, or even pizza dough. Find out why empanadas, the Spanish hand-held meal-in-a-pocket, are enjoyed from Buenos Aires to Miami!''

==Ingredients==

* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Dice|diced]] [[Cookbook:Onion|Oso Sweet onions]]

'''Friar's Omelette''' is a traditional Scottish recipe, for an egg recipe with apple usually being its main ingredient, however apple can be substituted for other fruit such a [[Cookbook:Rhubarb|rhubarb]], [[Cookbook:Plum|plums]] (with stones removed) or [[Cookbook:Blackberry|blackberry]].

==Ingredients==
*6 medium [[Cookbook:Apple|cooking apples]]
*4 ounces (125g or one stick) [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] plus butter for greasing a baking dish 
*2 ounces (50g or 4 tablespoons) [[Cookbook:Sugar|white sugar]]
*1 ounce (25g or rounded tablespoon) white sugar for decoration 
*2 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]], well beaten 
*4 ounces (125g or 1 cup) [[Cookbook:Bread Crumb|breadcrumbs]]
*a quarter pint (150mL) [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
*a squeeze of [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]

==Procedure==
# Peel and core the apples, slice and place in a saucepan with the water. 
# Cook until soft (similar to apple sauce), then remove from heat and add butter, sugar and lemon juice; mix well.
# While this is cooling, beat the eggs very well - when the apple mixture is cool, mix in the eggs as well.
# Butter a deep baking dish and spread the breadcrumbs around it so that they stick to the bottom and the sides, keeping a good amount for the top. 
# Pour the apple and egg mixture into the dish and cover with a thick layer of breadcrumbs. 
# Bake in a moderate oven (350°F/180°C/Gas Mark 4) for about half an hour. 
# Turn out onto a flat dish and sprinkle with sugar before serving.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Cuisine of India]]

==Ingredients==
* [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]]
* [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yoghurt]]
* [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|green chillies]], chopped
* [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|green chillies]], whole
* [[Cookbook:Mint|mint leaves]], chopped
* [[Cookbook:Ghee|ghee]]
* [[Cookbook:Garam Masala|garam masala]], both powder and whole spices
* [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]] and [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] paste
* [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]]
* [[Cookbook:Saffron|saffron]]
* [[Cookbook:Cilantro|coriander leaves]]
* [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]

==Procedure==

# Marinate chicken with fried onions (should be red and just crush it with hand, don't blend), yoghurt (put a lot of yoghurt and onions if you want a lot of masala), chopped green peppers (don't use [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|red mirchi powder]], the taste won't be the same), chopped mint leaves, ghee, garam masala powder, salt, ginger garlic paste. Leave this to marinate at least 4-5 hours if it's chicken, and 12 hours if it's [[Cookbook:Lamb|lamb]] or [[Cookbook:Goat|goat]].
# Meanwhile prepare for the rice by putting all these ingredients out, because the rice gets ruined if you start looking for everything while doing the ... mix food color or zaafran (saffron) in milk, chop coriander leaves, a few green peppers (whole, don't chop), garam masala powder, fried onions, butter or ghee, lemon juice.
# Boil water, when it starts getting hot, put whole garam masala (long, big ilaichi - the black one, kala zeera ([[Cookbook:Black Cumin|black cumin]]), whole [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]], [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon sticks]]) and a little bit of oil so that the rice grains don't stick to each other (something I learned from my mommy) and salt... when the water comes to boil, put the rice in and boil slightly (I keep the mark by checking the rice and I strain it when the rice grain gets 3-4 lines on 'em LOL... cook it a lot less than you normally would for regular [[Cookbook:Biryani|biryani]] because it has to cook more with the chicken...)
# Once you strain the rice, leave a thin layer of rice on the bottom of the pot because the chicken/meat tends to stick, so if there's rice on the bottom, that'll stick, not the meat.
# Dump the marinated chicken in the pateela, and cover the chicken with rice. 
# Cut the butter stick into 4 pieces and put each piece in a different part of the pot. 
# Pour the lemon juice over the rice, I like to make a smilie face with the color/saffron milk sticking the green peppers in the rice as eyes LOL... 
# Then put the coriander, fried onions and sprinkle a bit of garam masala powder. 
# Cover the pot completely with foil and then the cover so that no steam gets out. Leave it on high heat for a while (maybe 10 mins) after that turn it to medium.
# If you have a burner, its better than an electric stove because the heat gets everywhere; but to be on the safe side, rotate the pot every 10 mins so that the meat cooks evenly. 
# After about 30-35 mins, you'll smell the biryani because of immense steam coming out of the pot... you might want to check if the rice looks properly cooked... if so you can turn it off... if there's no steam coming out, then leave it a few minutes more...

'''Chicken Lumpia'''

These Filipino egg rolls make a tasty dish.

==Ingredients==

* 1½ [[Cookbook:Pound|pounds]] ground [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] or [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]]
* ⅓ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Chop|chopped]] [[Cookbook:Water Chestnut|water chestnuts]]
* ½ cup chopped [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* 4 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* ¼ cup [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and freshly ground [[Cookbook:Black Pepper|black pepper]], to taste

* 4 cups [[Cookbook:Oil|cooking oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Sweet and Sour|sweet and sour sauce]]

==Directions==

# In a large bowl, combine meat, water chestnuts, onion, eggs, soy sauce, salt, and pepper.
# Mix well and set aside.
# On a clean, dry surface, place one egg roll wrapper with one corner facing you (like a baseball diamond).
# Place about 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] of the meat mixture in the center of the wrapper.
# Dip your fingers in a glass of water and lightly wet the corner pointing away from you (second base).
# Fold the corner closest to you (home base) over the mixture, then fold the side corners over that and roll away from your body.
# The wet corner should seal the roll.
# Repeat the process with the remaining ingredients.
# Place the rolls in large zip-close plastic bags and freeze overnight.
# In a large [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]], heat the oil to about 350°F (use an instant cooking thermometer), or until it begins to shimmer and the oil bubbles lightly when a wooden chopstick is inserted.
# Using [[Cookbook:Tongs|tongs]], place each frozen lumpia roll in the hot oil and [[Cookbook:Fry|fry]] until brown, about 3 to 4 minutes.
# Use tongs to turn rolls to ensure even cooking.
# Remove the rolls to a plate covered with paper towels to absorb excess oil.

* etli = meat
* ispanakli = with spinach
* karisik = mixed
* kasar peynirli = with yellow cow's milk cheese
* katmer = plain
* kiymali = with ground lamb
* mantarlı = mushrooms
* patatesli = with mashed potatoes
* peynirli = with white sheep's milk cheese (feta)

A modern variation is honey and banana served hot with a slice of lemon.

== Ingredients ==
Serves 10

* 5¼ cups (600 grams) of [[Cookbook:flour|all-purpose flour]]
* 2½ teaspoons (15 grams) of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

== Procedure ==
[[Image:Istanbul turkey restaurant pancakes.jpg|right|thumb|Preparing gözleme; Istanbul, Turkey.]]
===The Dough===
# Sift flour in a large bowl, reserving one cup of flour. 
# Sprinkle with salt and mix. Make a hole in the centre. 
# Combine yeast and sugar in a small bowl. 
# Add ¼ of a cup of warm water, stir. Pour into hole in the centre of the flour. 
# Cover yeast with some flour. Let stand for 10 minutes to rise. 
# Stir in remaining water, blending thoroughly. Knead for 5 minutes to form a medium soft dough. 
# Cover and let rise in a warm place for one hour or until double in bulk. 

===The Gözleme===
# Place dough on lightly floured board. Divide into 10 portions with floured hands. 
# Shape into balls; roll each ball out with rolling pin into rectangles 5 mm thick. Brush with oil. 
# Fold opposite edges over, bringing edges together in centre. 
# Spread filling over half of pastry. Then fold other half over filling shaping into an oblong. 
# Seal edges well, pressing slightly. 

===The Cooking===
# Heat griddle or a cast iron skillet. 
# Grease with butter and place gözleme on griddle. 
# Brown on both sides. Serve hot.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Afghanistan|Cuisine of Afghanistan]]

'''Afghan bread''' or '''Nan-i-Afghani''' is the national bread of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]]. It is a [[Cookbook:Flatbread|flatbread]] and can be oval or rectangular. It is baked in a [[Cookbook:tandoor|tandoor]], the primary cooking equipment of the sub-continent region. The Afghan tandoor sits above ground and is round and made of bricks, which are heated to cook the bread. Afghan bread, also known as &quot;nan breads&quot;, are shaped, then stuck onto the sides of the oven to bake. Often black cumin seeds or caraway seeds are sprinkled on Afghan bread for decoration as much as taste, and lines are made in the dough lengthwise to add texture to the bread. Afghan bread is similar to [[Cookbook:Pita|pita]] or [[Cookbook:Lebanese Bread|Lebanese bread]].

Afghan bread is commonly stocked at [[Cookbook:Middle Eastern cuisines|Middle Eastern]] grocery stores in western countries. In Afghanistan the baker still cooks the bread the traditional way by spreading the dough around the tandoor, whereby it gets puffy quickly and starts to colour and emit a fresh bread smell that draws the early morning throngs of people. The baker then uses two long iron tongs to pull the bread from the tandoor wall. It is carried in cloth bags by Afghans, unlike western breads packaged in plastic. 

Afghans serve bread with most meals; it is used as an equivalent to a fork to envelop foods and soak up liquids on the plate. Generally the bread is torn into shreds and used to pinch the foods, similar to a sandwich. The bread acts as both fork and spoon, as Afghan often use their hands to eat. The bread has no firm crust and tastes similar to Indian [[Cookbook:naan|naan]] bread. It has a dense and rich taste.  

==Ingredients==
makes 8 Afghan breads
* 1½ cups plus 1 tablespoon of [[Cookbook:Water|water]] (divided)
* 1 700 grams dry [[Cookbook:yeast|yeast]]
* 1 tablespoon of [[Cookbook:sugar|sugar]]
* 4 cups of [[Cookbook:flour|flour]]
* 1 tablespoon of [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
* ¼ cup of [[Cookbook:Corn Oil|corn oil]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Egg Yolk|egg yolk]]

==Procedure==
# Mix ½ cup water, yeast, and sugar. Let it sit for 10 minutes.
# Place flour in a mixing bowl and sprinkle in the salt. Make a well, then add oil and yeast mixture. Stir in and add small amounts of water until it forms a soft dough that can be moulded. Knead for 5 mins. Cover with paper and let rise for 1½ hours.
# Mix together the egg yolk and 1 tablespoon of water, and set aside.
# Divide dough into eight parts and roll each into a ball. Roll each bread into an oval shape 20cms long 5cms thick.
# Make lines in top of dough. Brush on egg mix and sprinkle with black cumin seeds.
# Bake in a preheated 350°F (175°C) oven for 25 mins.

Total cooking time is around 2½ hours.

'''Apricot Wine'''

==Ingredients==

* 1 [[Cookbook:Pound|pound]] [[Cookbook:Apricot|dried apricots]]
* 4 [[Cookbook:Quart|quarts]] [[Cookbook:Water|warm water]]
* 6½ [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|granulated sugar]]
* 2¼ cups brown sugar
* 1½ cups [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemons]], sliced thin
* 2 [[Cookbook:Orange|oranges]]
* ½ [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast cake]]

==Directions==

# Wash the apricots in several changes of water, then dry and cut in halves.
# Place in a large crock and pour on the warm water, reserving ½ cup of water in which to dissolve the yeast cake.
# Stir in the sugars, fruit, raisins, and ginger.
# Add the dissolved yeast and mix well.
# Cover with the top of the crock and let stand.
# Stir every other day.
# After thirty days, strain the mixture and bottle it.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* '''Be sure to check with national, regional, and municipal laws, to produce wine lawfully!'''
* '''Please drink alcoholic beverages responsibly, and have someone sober drive you, if you need to travel after imbibing.'''
* '''Please do not share with underage people.'''
* To jump start the yeast, dissolve in water with a pinch of the sugar the night before starting, and let stand covered with cloth or a paper towel in a warm place, like the top of the refrigerator.
* An actual wine yeast from a wine making store or supplier would also improve outcome.
* Extreme cleanliness will prevent spoiling due to bacteria or wild yeast.
* For best fermentation, keep in a temperature you are comfortable in. Too cool and it ferments slower, too warm and it will ferment bitter, too hot and the yeast will die. ''They are alive, you know!''

'''Tofu bacon''' is easy to make.  It can be used interchangeably with bacon in most recipes.  Great with breakfast or in a b.l.t. 

== Ingredients ==
* 1 block extra firm tofu
* 3 tbsp vegetable oil
* 3 tbsp soy sauce or tamari
* 3 tbsp nutritional yeast
* liquid smoke (optional)

== Instructions ==

Slice the tofu into thin strips (as bacon) and fry in a pan on medium, turning once, until crispy and gold brown on each side.  Add soy sauce and one to two drops of liquid smoke (available in any large grocery store), toss with the tofu bacon slices, coat with nutritional yeast, and remove from heat.

Enjoy with friends.

'''Rumaki''' is a pūpū (hors d'œuvre) of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Hawaii|Hawaiian]] origin. Its ingredients and method of preparation vary, but usually it consists of water chestnuts and pieces of chicken liver wrapped in bacon and marinated in soy sauce and either ginger or brown sugar.

(Yes, you can actually get away with serving liver to your guests.)

''The Rumaki recipe is a classic party appetizer recipe, proving that anything wrapped in bacon tastes good—even liver. But you can opt for scallops, shrimp or stuffed olives, instead.'' 

== Ingredients ==
 
===Rumaki===
*12 slices [[Cookbook:bacon|bacon]], halved crosswise
*12 ounces [[Cookbook:chicken liver|chicken liver]]s, halved
*12 whole [[Cookbook:water chestnuts|water chestnuts]], halved

===Marinade===
*¼ cup [[Cookbook:soy sauce|soy sauce]]
*1 teaspoon fresh minced [[Cookbook:ginger|ginger]]
*2 tablespoons dry [[Cookbook:sherry|sherry]]
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:sugar|sugar]]

==Procedure==
#The Rumaki recipe begins with the marinade: Combine soy sauce, ginger, sherry and sugar in a small bowl. Add the chicken livers and water chestnut pieces and marinate them in the refrigerator for 1/2 hour. 
#Place 1 chicken liver piece and 1 chestnut piece in the center of each bacon-half, wrap, and secure with a toothpick. 
#Place the Rumaki on a [[Cookbook:broiler pan|broiler pan]] or shallow [[Cookbook:baking pan|baking pan]] and [[Cookbook:broil|broil]], about 5 or 6 inches from the heat, until the bacon is crisp, about 10 to 15 minutes. Or, you may bake the appetizers in a 375 °F oven for 20 to 25 minutes. Serve hot. Makes 24 appetizers. 

==Notes, tips, and variations== 
*Add fresh sliced [[Cookbook:scallion|scallion]]s to the combination above. 
*Substitute [[Cookbook:Scallop|sea scallops]] for the chicken livers and/or water chestnuts. 
*Omit marinade and wrap bacon around [[Cookbook:Smoked Oysters|smoked oysters]], stuffed [[Cookbook:Olive|green olives]], or [[Cookbook:pineapple|pineapple]] chunks. 
*[[Cookbook:Shrimp Rumaki|Shrimp Rumaki]]: 1 medium shrimp with 1 whole water chestnut and a piece of green onion, with or without the marinade.

'''Pastei''' is a very old dish and was brought to Suriname by the Jewish settlers. It is a simple dish made from chicken, carrots and peas, and closely resembles chicken pot pie. It is served best with plain white rice.

==Ingredients==

===For the dough===

* 200 g [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
* 250 g [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 2 dl (200 ml) cold [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* 2 tsp [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

===For the filling===

* 3 large pieces of [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] (drumstick and thigh, breast, what have you. I use breast most often.)
* 3 [[Cookbook:Pickle|pickles]]
* 3 [[Cookbook:Hard Boiled Eggs|hard boiled eggs]]
* 1 or 2 cans of [[Cookbook:Pea|peas]] and [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]]
* 1 tblsp [[Cookbook:Piccalilli|piccalilli]] ([[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]] can be substituted)
* 2 large [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
* [[Cookbook:Allspice|allspice]]
* 1 piece of young [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]]
* 1 fresh [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili pepper]] (or [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell pepper]] if preferred) (optional)
* 2 tblsp [[Cookbook:Ketchup|ketchup]]
* 150 g [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaf]]
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Worcestershire Sauce|Worcestershire sauce]] (optional)
* 1 large [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] or [[Cookbook:Bouillon Cubes|bouillon cubes]] to get the right taste.

==Procedure==

===For the dough===

# Mix the butter with an electric mixer or a wooden spoon. Keep adding little bits of the water until the butter has absorbed it all. 
# Sift the flour, baking powder and the salt all together and add this through the butter gradually. To see if the dough is rollable, press your finger on it and if the dough doesn't stick to it, it's fine. If the dough does stick however, add about 25 more grams of flour. 
# Roll out the dough to make it flat. 
# Put the flattened dough in a baking pan or aluminum foil pan (the pan has to be buttered on the inside before the dough is put in it). Press the dough to the corners of the pan so that as much filling as possible can go in. Do not use all the dough for the inside of the pan, because after the pan has been filled, it needs to be closed off at the top with dough as well.

===For the filling===

# Wash the chicken (if necessary). 
# For about half an hour, cook the chicken, 100 g butter, fine chopped onion, 2 or 3 bouillon cubes, the fresh pepper, the bay leaf and some allspice in about 1 or 1.5 cups of water. 
# After this time, strip the chicken (discarding the bones) into little pieces. 
# Put the rest of the butter in the broth in which the chicken had been boiled. 
# In a pan, put a little bit of oil and when that is hot, add a little bit of fine chopped onion.
# Add the chicken. After a minute add the chopped tomatoes and the peas and carrots. 
# Every so often, add a little bit of the chicken broth to the pan so that it won't burn. 
# Add the chopped pickles. 
# After the broth has been added and the whole seems good, taste to see if it has enough salt, otherwise add some. 
# After the whole has cooled off a bit, get the baking pan with the dough already in it put the chicken and sch in the pan until it is nicely filled. 
# Slice your cooked eggs and place them on top of the filling in the pan. 
# After this is done, the baking pan can be closed off with another piece of dough on the top of the pan. Try to close it up as best as possible. 
# Put the pastei in a preheated oven and leave it for about ¾ of an hour. 
# A few minutes before you take it out of the oven, you can lightly streak the top with some whisked egg to make the top shiny and a little crisp.

Enjoy.

'''Kipspek''', which literally translates into &quot;chickenbacon&quot; is a very easy snack that they used to make in the restaurant my mother managed.

==Ingredients==

* 1 or 2 [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken breasts]] (cubed)
* [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]] (in strips)
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]
* 1 or 2 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* [[Cookbook:Bread Crumb|breadcrumbs]] (These breadcrumbs should be very fine, almost like a powder)
* [[Cookbook:Toothpick|toothpicks]]
* [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]

==Procedure==
# Put some salt and black pepper on the chicken so that it has some flavor.
# Take the strips of bacon and wrap the each cube of chicken into a separate strip.
# To make sure the bacon doesn't roll of the chicken, stick a toothpick from one end to the other.
# Roll the kipspek in the breadcrumbs.
# Whisk the egg(s) and for every kipspek, drop it in the egg quickly and take it out.
# Roll the kipspek through the breadcrumbs once again.
# leave them for about half an hour.
# heat the oil in a frying pot.
# Fry the kipspek's until they're golden brown. 
# Serve with ketchup or mustard

Don't forget to remove the toothpick before taking a bite.

Enjoy

'''Mápó dòufu''' (麻婆豆腐) is a classic spicy tofu and meat dish from Szechuan province in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|China]]. It is very flavoursome, easy to prepare, and best of all, spicy!

==Ingredients==

* 200g (7 oz) [[Cookbook:Mincing|minced]] [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]], [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]]
* 500g (1 lb) [[Cookbook:Tofu|silken tofu]], cubed
* small piece of [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]], minced (about 2 tsp)
* 4 cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], minced
* 2 tbsp [[Cookbook:Chili Bean Paste|chili bean paste]]
* 1-2 tsp crushed dried [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili]] pepper
* 1 tbsp [[Cookbook:Szechuan Pepper|Szechuan pepper]], roasted and ground
* 1 tbsp [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], sliced
* 3-4 [[Cookbook:Green onion|green onions]], cut into 2cm (1&quot;) pieces
* 1 tbsp [[Cookbook:Rice Wine|rice wine]]
* 2-3 [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]] &amp;ndash; tree ears preferred (optional)

==Procedure==

# If adding dried mushrooms, soak these in hot water for 10 minutes while preparing the rest of the ingredients, then slice before adding later.
# [[Cookbook:Sautéing|Sauté]] the onion with the ginger and crushed chili.
# Add the minced meat and garlic, and fry until brown.
# Mix in the other ingredients (including sliced mushrooms), lower heat, and simmer for 5-10 minutes.

Serve over steamed [[Cookbook:Rice|jasmine rice]].

==Notes, tips and variations==
* Some extra chili pepper can be substituted for Szechuan pepper, but the taste and mouthfeel will be different (no numbness).
* A little ground [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]] and [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]] are very nice in this dish, especially if you can't get the Szechuan pepper easily.
* A [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|red bell pepper]], a tomato, and fresh [[Cookbook:Cilantro|coriander leaf]] are all welcome additions, though not traditional.
* The meal is just as good with whole [[Cookbook:Legume|beans]] instead of tofu.
* A vegetarian version of this meal can be made by substituting the meat with [[Cookbook:Ground_Tofu|ground tofu]] (e.g. [http://shiokfood.com/notes/archives/000016.html Shiok Food's Vegetarian Ma Po Tofu])

| [[Cookbook:Vegetarian cuisine|Vegetarian Cuisine]] 

==Ingredients==

* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] all-purpose bleached [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* ¼ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]]
* ¾ cup [[Cookbook:Buttermilk|buttermilk]]
* ¼ cup [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 1 large [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] unsalted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], melted
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla extract]]
* [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|Vegetable oil]] for brushing [[Cookbook:Griddle|griddle]]

==Procedure==

# Heat a large non-stick [[Cookbook:Skillet|skillet]] or griddle over low heat while preparing ingredients.
# Mix flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in medium bowl.
# [[Cookbook:Microwave Oven|Microwave]] buttermilk and milk in a 2-cup Pyrex measuring cup to room temperature, 20 to 30 seconds.
# [[Cookbook:Whisk|Whisk]] in egg, butter, and vanilla.
# Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and whisk until just mixed.
# Return batter to measuring cup, stirring in a teaspoon or two of [[Cookbook:Water|water]], if necessary, to make a thick, but pourable batter.
# Increase heat to medium and generously brush skillet or griddle with oil.
# When oil starts to spider, but before it starts to smoke, pour batter, about ¼ cup at a time.
# Work in batches, if necessary, to avoid overcrowding.
# When pancake bottoms are golden brown and tops start to bubble, 2 to 3 minutes, flip pancakes.
# Cook until pancakes are golden brown on remaining side.
# Repeat, brushing skillet or griddle with oil.
# Serve hot.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* Use all-purpose flour (which is softer than unbleached), not unbleached flour to make a tender pancake.
* If using salted butter, reduce salt to ¼ teaspoon.
* I usually substitute a tablespoon of lemon juice (or vinegar) in milk for the buttermilk.
* Pancake batter should pour, not glug! On the other hand, runny batter makes thin, oddly shaped pancakes that frequently collide on the griddle. Stir in a touch more flour into thin batter. For batter that's too thick, whisk in water, a teaspoon at a time.
* The temperature of the pan or griddle is important: too hot and the pancakes are dark and raw; too cool and they're blond and hard. For tender, golden brown pancakes, heat the pan or griddle on low while you make the batter. Then increase the heat to medium and generously brush the pan or griddle with oil. It's ready when the oil starts to shimmer and, in any skillet or griddle other than non-stick, sends out tendrils that resemble an octopus or spider. But if the pan starts to smoke, set it down off the burner until the smoking subsides and the oil cools a bit.
* This recipe easily doubles for a crowd.

* I usually substitute a tablespoon of lemon juice (or vinegar) in milk for the buttermilk.
* Pancake batter should pour, not glug! On the other hand, runny batter makes thin, oddly shaped pancakes that frequently collide on the griddle. Stir in a touch more flour into thin batter. For batter that's too thick, whisk in water, a teaspoon at a time.
* The temperature of the pan or griddle is important: too hot and the pancakes are dark and raw; too cool and they're blond and hard. For tender, golden brown pancakes, heat the pan or griddle on low while you make the batter. Then increase the heat to medium and generously brush the pan or griddle with oil. It's ready when the oil starts to shimmer and, in any skillet or griddle other than non-stick, sends out tendrils that resemble and octopus or spider. But if the pan starts to smoke, set it down off the burner until the smoking subsides and the oil cools a bit.
* This recipe easily doubles for a crowd.

For tender, golden brown pancakes, heat the pan or griddle on low while you make the batter. Then increase the heat to medium and generously brush the pan or griddle with oil. It's ready when the oil starts to shimmer and, in any skillet or griddle other than non-stick, sends out tendrils that resemble and octopus or spider. But if the pan starts to smoke, set it down off the burner until the smoking subsides and the oil cools a bit.
* This recipe easily doubles for a crowd.

==Ingredients==

* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] all-purpose bleached [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* ¼ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]]
* 1 teaspoon finely grated [[Cookbook:Orange|orange]] [[Cookbook:Zest|zest]]
* ¼ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Cardamom|ground cardamom]]
* ¾ cup [[Cookbook:Buttermilk|buttermilk]]
* ¼ cup [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 1 large [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] unsalted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], melted
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla extract]]
* [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|Vegetable oil]] for brushing [[Cookbook:Griddle|griddle]]

==Procedure==

# Heat a large non-stick [[Cookbook:Skillet|skillet]] or griddle over low heat while preparing ingredients.
# Mix flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in medium bowl.
# [[Cookbook:Whisk|Whisk]] orange zest and ground cardamom into dry ingredients.
# [[Cookbook:Microwave Oven|Microwave]] buttermilk and milk in a 2-cup Pyrex measuring cup to room temperature, 20 to 30 seconds.
# Whisk in egg, butter, and vanilla.
# Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and whisk until just mixed.
# Return batter to measuring cup, stirring in a teaspoon or two of [[Cookbook:Water|water]], if necessary, to make a thick, but pourable batter.
# Increase heat to medium and generously brush skillet or griddle with oil.
# When oil starts to spider, but before it starts to smoke, pour batter, about ¼ cup at a time.
# Work in batches, if necessary, to avoid overcrowding.
# When pancake bottoms are golden brown and tops start to bubble, 2 to 3 minutes, flip pancakes.
# Cook until pancakes are golden brown on remaining side.
# Repeat, brushing skillet or griddle with oil.
# Serve hot.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* Use all-purpose flour (which is softer than unbleached), not unbleached flour to make a tender pancake.
* If using salted butter, reduce salt to ¼ teaspoon.
* I usually substitute a tablespoon of lemon juice (or vinegar) in milk for the buttermilk.
* Pancake batter should pour, not glug! On the other hand, runny batter makes thin, oddly shaped pancakes that frequently collide on the griddle. Stir in a touch more flour into thin batter. For batter that's too thick, whisk in water, a teaspoon at a time.
* The temperature of the pan or griddle is important: too hot and the pancakes are dark and raw; too cool and they're blond and hard.

==Author's note==
This recipe originated when I tried to adapt my [[Cookbook:Mike's Saffron Rice and Beans|saffron rice and beans]] for a barbecue.  I planned on heating saffron rice and beans over a wood fire at the barbecue as a vegetarian main course, but didn't make enough rice, and added some raw ingredients at the last minute before slow-cooking over the fire.  Later I liked it so much that I made it in the oven.

==Ingredients==
* 2 [[Cookbook:Onion|Onions]] cut into chunks
* 3 [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], cut into large chunks
* several [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]], cut into large chunks
* One can [[Cookbook:Garbanzo|Canned chickpeas]] or [[Cookbook:Black Bean|black beans]]
* Other vegetables, [[Cookbook:Zucchini|zucchini]], [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell pepper]], etc, cut into chunks
* 1/3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] of [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Curry Powder|curry powder]]
* 5-10 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* Misc spices, good ones include [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]], [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]], ground [[Cookbook:Chili|chili]] or [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|chili powder]], [[Cookbook:Oregano|ground oregano]] , etc
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Basmati rice|basmati rice]]
* 750 ml [[Cookbook:Wine|red wine]] -- the cheapest you can stand to drink -- I use Charles Shaw merlot, although any of the equivalently priced box-wines will work, so long as you get the red.

==Procedure==
# Put one tablespoon of olive oil in saucepan, heat.
# Stir in curry powder
# Stir in rice, fry rice briefly (5 minutes or so -- although the dish works if the rice is raw too) while stirring
# Pre-heat oven to 250
# Turn off heat, put vegetables, spices, and garlic, followed by rice with curry oil, followed with the can of beans and half the bottle of wine in a casserole dish
with a cover.  Stir briefly to mix, and make sure some at least some rice is on top.
# add rest of olive oil to casserole dish, fill with either water or remainder of wine until all vegetables, beans and rice are submerged in fluid
# Place casserole dish (covered) in oven, drink any remaining wine
# Wait for a couple hours, periodically checking to see if rice is soft.
# Once rice is soft its ready to eat.

==Variations==

# If you turn the oven hotter it'll cook faster.  The whole point of the low heat is you can start this saturday afternoon, forget about it for most of the day, and then have dinner ready.

# Also works over a campfire.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Vegan_cuisine|Vegan Cuisine]] 

==Original authors note==

Every vegan should know about aioli and related sauces.  They add a creaminess which can be otherwise rare in vegan cooking.

The key to the not-vegan-tasting deliciousness of an aioli is the garlic / olive oil emulsion.  The same principle is at work in hummus (and marinara the way I sometimes make it).  Other common emulsifiers are glycerin (which tastes awful), soy lecithin (present in soymilk, tofu etc) and egg yolk (which is, obviously, not vegan).

I don't know how strict Europeans are about what they call &quot;aioli&quot;, but in California it is not uncommon to see a wide variety of homemade garlic-oil emulsions described as such (particularly if the water-based component of the emulsion is a vinegar of one sort or another -- in this case we use citric acid instead).  A common use of these sauces is as an artichoke marinade or dip.

==Note on carrots==

Carrots can damage some blending equipment.  I cut them really small so they're easier to blend.  Be warned.

==Ingredients==
* One [[Cookbook:Carrot|Carrot]]
* [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|Olive Oil]]
* 1 pinch [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 5 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|Serrano Chile]]
* [[Cookbook:Orange|Orange]] or [[Cookbook:Orange Juice|Orange Juice]] (any other citrus works)
Optional
**French-style or [[Cookbook:Dijon Mustard|Dijon mustard]] (i.e. one that does not contain &quot;turmeric&quot; in the list of ingredients)

==Procedure==
# Cut carrot extremely fine (1 mm slivers) so that blender can handle it.
# Place all ingredients (start with 2 tablespoon olive oil) (Squeeze juice of 1 or more oranges, but don't add any orange peel) into blender-safe dish
# blend
# continue adding olive oil blending and tasting until it reaches desired creaminess.

==Ingredients==
===For soup===
* 1 whole Cat fish or firm white fish
* 1 quart (950ml) Water
* Freshly ground black pepper 
* 2 teaspoons salt 
* 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Fish Sauce|Nước mắm]]
* ½ cup (120g) sour bamboo
* ¼ fresh pineapple – core removed, cut lengthwise and sliced

===For marinade===
* 2 [[Cookbook:Scallion|scallions]], remove green part and reserve for garnish – crush white part
* 4 teaspoons Nước mắm
* 1 teaspoons salt 

===Garnish===
* 2 tablespoons fresh [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]] – chopped
* Green part of scallions - chopped

==Procedure==
Traditionally, the fish head is not removed, but if you prefer, it’s not necessary for this dish. Marinate the fish for 15 minutes with the crushed scallions, black pepper, 1 tsp salt, and 4 tsp Nước mắm.

Bring water to the boil. Add the sour bamboo and pineapple slices. Boil for 5 minutes. Add marinated fish and continue to boil for a total of 10 minutes. While the fish is boiling, add 2 tablespoons Nước mắm, and 1 teaspoon salt.

For serving, the soup can be garnished with coriander and the green part of scallions.

==Ingredients==

* 3 or 4 strips thickened smoked [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]], [[Cookbook:Dice|diced]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Pound|pound]] large [[Cookbook:Shrimp|shrimp]]
* 6 servings of [[Cookbook:Grits|grits]], follow directions on box

* ¼ cup [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* ½ large sweet [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], cut into thin strips
* ½ yellow [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell pepper]], cut into strips
* ½ red bell pepper, cut into strips
* 2 to 3 [[Cookbook:Garlic|cloves garlic]], minced
* ¼ to ½ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] hot sauce, or to taste, optional
* [[Cookbook:Lime|juice of one lime]]

==Procedure==

# [[Cookbook:Frying|Fry]] bacon until crisp, remove and set aside.
# [[Cookbook:Sautéing|Sauté]] onions, garlic, and peppers in bacon grease, add lime juice and hot sauce and set aside.
# Prepare grits and add cheese and butter when done cooking to allow for them to melt, then set aside.
# Stir when done melting.
# Sauté the shrimp until they turn pink, about 2 to 3 minutes.&lt;br/&gt; ''If you are planning to use unpeeled shrimp, plan an extra 20 minutes to peel the shrimp!''
# Place the grits and cheese in large serving container and place the shrimp down the center of the container.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* If served on individual dish/platter, slice limes on the side.
* In preparing the grits, you may want to use [[Cookbook:Milk|condensed milk]] instead of [[Cookbook:Water|water]] to make the grits for an extra creamy texture!
* As an alternative, add garden peas to grits and serve steamed peppers, zucchini, yellow squash, and mushrooms on the side. Adds a great taste texture with the peas!

* If you can't find Tuscan kale, you can put in regular kale, mustard greens, or Swiss chard.
* This soup tastes even better the next day.

==Ingredients==

* 1 [[Cookbook:Quart|quart]] [[Cookbook:Clam|clams]], canned or fresh
* 1 quart rich [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]], [[Cookbook:Scald|scalded]]
* ¼ [[Cookbook:Pound|pound]] salt [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste
* 1 quart [[Cookbook:Dice|diced]] [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]
* [[Cookbook:Butter|Butter]], if desired
* 1 [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], diced or [[Cookbook:Chopping|chopped]]

==Procedure==

# Remove black parts from clams, saving the liquor.
# Cut pork in small pieces and [[Cookbook:Frying|fry]] until crisp and golden brown, then remove small pieces of pork from the fat.
# Discard fat.
# Add potatoes and onion, with just enough hot water to be seen through the potatoes.
# Cook over low heat-just [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]]-until done.
# When potatoes are done, add clams and pork and cook for 2 minutes after coming to a [[Cookbook:Boiling|boil]]. (Longer cooking will make the clams tough).
# Remove chowder from heat and let stand for few minutes, then add hot milk, the clam liquor and seasoning to taste. (If seasonings are added before hot milk, chowder may curdle.)
# May add butter to each bowl, for extra taste.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* Chowder is usually better if left till the next day.

===Baklava===

==Ingredients==
'''Syrup'''
* 4 cups sugar
* 2 cups water
* 2 [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]] sticks – 3 inches long
* ¾ cups [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]]
* 1 tbsp lemon juice

'''Note:''' You can add more honey and reduce the amount of sugar.

'''Nut mixture'''
* 1½ lbs [[Cookbook:Pistachio|pistachio]] nuts
* 2 tsp cinnamon powder

'''Pastry'''
* 1 lb [[Cookbook:Phyllo| Phyllo]] dough – thawed
* 1¼ lbs unsalted butter – melted

'''Equipment'''
* Tall large pot for making syrup
* Candy thermometer
* Baking pan about the size of the Phyllo sheets
* 2-3 inch paintbrush for applying melted butter

==Directions==
* Thaw the Phyllo inside its plastic package. Don’t open it until you’re ready to use it. If you’re in a hurry you can thaw it in its sealed plastic package in warm water.

* Chop the nuts with the powdered cinnamon in a food processor. '''You want a fine chop, not powder.'''

* Combine the sugar, honey, water, cinnamon sticks, and lemon juice in a large pot. Stir well and boil until the mixture reaches 220°F (100°C) on a candy thermometer (soft ball). Remove it from heat, skim the top, and let cool. Remove the cinnamon sticks. '''The lemon is an important ingredient in the syrup as it keeps it from crystallizing while cooling.'''

* Melt the butter in a saucepan while the syrup is boiling. You can clarify the butter but it’s not necessary.

* Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C).

* Open the Phyllo and unfold it. Brush the inside of the baking pan with melted butter. While your assembling, cover the unused Phyllo with a damp towel. Make sure your butter is very liquid when you start. Put six (6) sheets of Phyllo in the pan, brushing each sheet with melted butter. Set aside another six (6) sheets which will be used for the top layers. After the first six sheets, sprinkle a handful of the nut mixture over the last sheet. Add another sheet and repeat the process until you get to the last six sheets. Place the last six sheets on top of the rest brushing each with butter. With a very sharp knife, cut the pastry into diamond shapes, all the way through. Sprinkle the top with water.

* Put the pastry into the preheated oven and bake for 1 hour or until the tops of the pastry are medium golden brown. When done, remove from the oven and ladle the cool syrup over the hot pastry.

* Let it sit for about 5-15 minutes, then drain off the excess syrup by tilting the pan as much as 45 degrees. Let it cool to near room temperature before eating.

| [[Cookbook:Poultry|Poultry recipes]] 

==Ingredients==

* 10 - 18 [[Cookbook:Pound|pound]] [[Cookbook:Turkey|turkey]]
* 4 [[Cookbook:Gallon|gallons]] [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|peanut oil]]

==Equipment==

* Dedicated turkey frying set: cooking pot, propane burner, 550°F 16 inch thermometer with clip, turkey stand, and triangular handled handled hook
* At least 10 pounds of propane
* ABC fire extinguisher, at least 3 pounds

==Procedure==

# Check fire extinguisher gauge. If not in safe/green zone, get a new one before proceeding to step #2.
# If frozen, thaw turkey in a safe manner. Remove giblets bag from cavity.
# Place turkey on its stand and set it in the dedicated turkey-frying pot.
# Pour water into pot until turkey is covered completely and water level is two inches above the turkey.
# Remove turkey from water, and mark level of water in pot.
# Pour out water (discard). Dry the pot thoroughly and fill to line with peanut oil.
# Heat oil in pot over propane burner to 400°F, by thermometer, in area at least TWENTY FEET FROM ANY BUILDING.
# Slowly lower completely thawed, completely drained turkey (on its stand) into oil using the hook with an oven mitt.
# The temperature of the oil will decrease to 350°F.  Maintain that temperature closely!
# Monitor temperature constantly until heat is turned off. Don't let it drop below 345°F or go over 355°F
# [[Cookbook:Frying|Fry]] turkey 3 minutes per pound.  Be careful not to over-cook it!  If it floats, it's over-done!
# Remove turkey using hook with oven mitt.
# Check temperature using meat thermometer in deep part of meat, to be at least 160°F.
# Turn off fire and allow to cool completely before even considering moving.
# Rest turkey on tray, breasts down, 20-30 minutes before carving.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* '''If you are not willing to perform step #1 of directions, you are not safe to cook using this method.'''
* '''If you cannot understand steps #3 through #6, do not use this method.'''
* The safest way to thaw a turkey is in the refrigerator. Any other way invites Salmonella.

'''Radish pie''' is a savory [[Cookbook:Pie|pie]] suitable for a vegetarian diet.  Radishes, fresh goat cheese, and walnuts give the pie a unique taste, which is most flavorful when served cold.

==Ingredients==
*1 to 2 bunches red [[Cookbook:Radish|radish]]es
*1 to 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Olive oil|olive oil]]
*1/4 cup (60 ml) [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], divided
*8 ounces (227g) phyllo dough
*1 red [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], chopped
*2 tablespoons dry sherry [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]]
*2 large [[Cookbook:egg|egg]]s, plus 1 yolk
*3/4 cup (177ml) heavy [[Cookbook:cream|cream]]
*4 ounces (113g) fresh goat [[Cookbook:cheese|cheese]] 
*3/4 cup (177ml) broken [[Cookbook:walnuts|walnut]] pieces
*1/3 cup (80ml) fresh Italian [[Cookbook:parsley|parsley]]

==Procedure==
#Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
#Wash the radishes well, remove and discard tops. Put radishes into a small baking dish and drizzle with olive oil. Bake for about an hour. Let them cool and then cut into small dice. (See tip #2 below.)
#Use half the butter to grease a pie pan, and then line it with pieces of phyllo dough, covering the pan evenly. Tuck under any stray bits to make a nice edge.
#Heat the remaining butter in a large pan and sauté the onion in it for about five minutes. Add the wine and diced radishes, then cook for another minute. Remove from heat and pour into the pastry shell.
#In a bowl, mix together the eggs and cream, and then pour over the vegetables in the pie crust. Crumble the goat cheese over the cream. 
#Bake the pie in a preheated oven at aforementioned temperature for 20 minutes.
#Add the walnuts and cook for another 15 - 20 minutes.
#Remove the pie from the oven and top it with the chopped parsley. 
#Let cool completely before serving.


Makes 6 to 8 servings.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Tip 1: Use fewer radishes for milder taste, or add more according to your own taste.
*Tip 2: The radishes can be baked the day before and then refrigerated until you make the pie.
*Tip 3: For a professional look, garnish each serving with a sprig of parsley.

'''Radish Tart''' is a tasty and colorful [[Cookbook:Pie|pie]], best served hot from the oven.  Fresh red radishes and yellow cheese give this pretty pie any interesting look and taste.

==Ingredients==
*1 cup all purpose flour
*1/2 cup cold [[Cookbook:butter|butter]]
*1 cup (4 ounces) shredded Edam, Gouda, or Gruyere [[Cookbook:cheese|cheese]], divided ([[Cookbook:Cheddar|Cheddar]] is also acceptable)
*1 cup heavy [[Cookbook:cream|cream]], divided
*4 [[Cookbook:egg|egg]] yolks
*1/4 teaspoon [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
*1/2 to 1 small bunch of red [[Cookbook:radish|radish]]es

==Procedure==
#Preheat oven to 425°.
#Sift and measure flour into a bowl. Cut in the butter until the particles are coarse. Stir in 1/2 of the cheese. Pour in 1/4 cup of the cream; toss the mixture with a fork until all parts are moistened.
#Turn the dough into a 9-inch round pie pan. With floured fingers, press the mixture into the bottom and sides of the pan, then prick the shell with a floured fork.
#Bake the pie shell for 10 to 12 minutes. (The sides will slip down a little during baking.) Cool on a wire rack.
#Lower the oven temperature to 325º.
#Sprinkle the remaining cheese evenly over the bottom of the cooled pie shell. Beat together the egg yolks, the 3/4 cup cream, and the salt. Pour the egg mixture over the cheese. Place the radish slices evenly over the top of the pie.
#Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until set. 
#Remove the pie from the oven, cut it into wedges, and serve it hot. 

Makes 6 to 8 servings.

==Tips==
*If you really like the taste of radishes, use 1/2 cup or more. For a milder pie, use 1/4 cup.
*The cheese crust has a pleasant crisp texture when eaten fresh out of the oven. Leftovers can be refrigerated and reheated later, but the texture will not be as good.
*A really sharp knife will aid in cutting the wedges without displacing the radishes.

# Once pancetta begins to brown, add pasta to boiling water.
# After pancetta is almost completely browned, reduce heat to medium and add the garlic and red pepper flakes.

An '''apple pie''' is a fruit [[Cookbook:Pie|pie]] (or [[Cookbook:Tart|tart]]) in which the principal filling ingredient is [[Cookbook:Apple|apple]]s.  Pastry is generally used top-and-bottom, making a double-crust pie, the upper crust of which may be a pastry lattice woven of strips; exceptions are '''deep-dish apple pie''' with a top crust only, and open-face
[[Cookbook:Tarte Tatin|Tarte Tatin]].

Here are two variations on apple pie:
#[[Cookbook:Apple Pie I|Apple Pie I]]: an apple pie recipe which suggests a variety of apples.
#[[Cookbook:Apple Pie II|Apple Pie II]]: a recipe that uses the first one as a model; uses McIntosh apples exclusively.

[[Image:ShepherdsPie-closeup.jpg|thumb|250px|Shepherd's Pie]]

{{see also|Cookbook:Shepherds Pie}}

==Ingredients==
*1[[Cookbook:Pound|lb]] (450[[Cookbook:g|g]]) [[Cookbook:Mincing|minced]] [[Cookbook:Lamb|lamb]] ( or ground [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] )
*3 lb (1.3[[Cookbook:kg|kg]]) powdery old [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], such as King Edwards
*1 large or 2 small [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]]
*2 tbsp flour
*2 cups [[Cookbook:Stock|beef stock]] (alternatively, [[Cookbook:Bouillon Cubes|bouillon cubes]] can be used, or gravy powder, if the flour is omitted)
*[[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]], grated (optional)
*a handful of mixed [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]] such as [[Cookbook:Corn|corn]] or [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]] (optional)
*[[Cookbook:Mixed Herbs|mixed herbs]]
*[[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]

==Procedure==
#Brown the mince in a frying pan. There is no need to add oil, as the meat is fatty enough.
#Finely chop the onion and lightly fry in a little butter until clear.
#Add the onions to the mince along with the mixed herbs and some pepper.
#Sprinkle the flour over the mixture and stir and cook for 3 - 4 minutes (if using gravy powder, omit this step).
#Cover with beef stock (or add water and beef bouillon/gravy powder) and [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]] for 30 minutes.
#Meanwhile peel, chop and boil the potatoes for 20 minutes until cooked.
#Once the meat is cooked, skim off the excess fat, then boil rapidly to reduce the liquid until it just covers the mince and onions.
#Drain the potatoes very well until completely dry. Mash until smooth and free of any lumps.
#Add butter to the mashed potato, taste and adjust the seasoning. Add enough milk to make the mash very soft (heavy mash will not float properly on top of the mince).
#Put mince mixture in a shallow oven proof dish.
#Spread the mash on top of the meat and brush the tops of the potatoes with melted butter.
#If desired, sprinkle the grated cheese on top of the mash.
#Spike the top with a fork.
# Cook in a hot oven for about 30-50 minutes until the top is golden brown.
#Serve with [[Cookbook:Legumes|peas or beans]].

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*The dish is sometimes made with [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] rather than [[Cookbook:Lamb|lamb]], though this might properly be called ''cottage pie''.
*Adding the butter and milk to the potatoes before they are properly mashed is the best way to make ''lumpy'' mash.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Spices and herbs|Spice]]

'''Tandoori masala''' is a mixture of spices specifically for use with a [[Cookbook:Tandoor|tandoor]], or clay oven, in traditional north [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Afghanistan|Afghani]] cooking. The specific spices vary somewhat from one region to another, but typically include fenugreek, cinnamon, cumin, coriander, garlic, ginger, etc.

The spices are ground to a fine powder in a coffee grinder or with a [[Cookbook:Mortar and Pestle|mortar and pestle]]. The masala is mixed with plain [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]], and meat (usually [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]]) is coated with the mixture, then slow-roasted in the tandoor. Chicken prepared in this fashion has a pink-coloured exterior and a savoury flavor.

The masala can be stored in airtight jars for up to 2 months, and is used in dishes like [[Cookbook:Tandoori Chicken|tandoori chicken]], [[Cookbook:Chicken Tikka Masala|chicken tikka masala]], [[Cookbook:Butter Chicken|butter chicken]], etc., all of them mostly Punjabi dishes. It can be used with meat other than chicken, for example, in tandoori fish or paneer tikka.

Nowadays, packets of tandoori chicken masala are readily available at major Indian supermarkets, with varying tastes depending on the brand. This convenience has led to many Indians buying the masala rather than making it at home.

== Ingredients ==
*1  	tablespoon   fenugreek seeds
*1/2 	teaspoon onion seeds
*1/2 	teaspoon salt
*1 	teaspoon garam masala
*1/2 	teaspoon turmeric powder
*1/2 	teaspoon curry powder
*1/2 	teaspoon coriander powder
*1/2 	teaspoon cumin powder
*1/4 	teaspoon chili powder
*1 1/2 	teaspoons paprika
*4 	garlic cloves, peeled and cleaned
*2 	tablespoons vegetable oil
*        fresh ginger (1 thumb-sized piece)
*2 	jalapeno peppers (seeds and all)
*1 	bunch fresh cilantro (washed, long stems cut off)
*1/4 	cup lemon juice
*1 	cup plain yogurt (An unthickened type of yogurt works best)

== Procedure ==
*Roast the fenugreek and onion seeds first by heating and tossing in a sauté pan for several minutes. Grind them together using a mortar and pestle or spice grinder.
*In a food processor, blend fenugreek and onion seeds with the salt, garam masala, turmeric, curry powder, coriander powder, cumin, chili powder, paprika, garlic, vegetable oil, ginger, jalapeños, cilantro and lemon juice until all the ingredients become a smooth paste.
*Spoon the mixture into a large mixing bowl and stir in the yogurt.
*Marinate meat or fish for eight hours (or bathe first in white distilled vinegar for shorter marination time). Tofu, vegetables or paneer can be tossed into the marinade just before grilling. Use the marinade to baste over the grill.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Beer|Beer recipes]]

'''Oatmeal Stout Brownies''' This recipe, created by Joe Stutler, was a national finalist in the 2006 Cooking With Beer Challenge. The malt and oats in the beer enhance the flavor of the chocolate in these delicious brownies. Not overly cake-ey, not overly fudge-ey, the texture is nicely balanced. They're also decadently chocolate, and surprisingly light (thanks to the eggs). Great with a fruity beer, such as a lambic (Framboise, yum!).

==Ingredients==
* 1 cup all-purpose [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* ¾ cup unsweetened [[Cookbook:Cocoa|cocoa]] powder (Dutch-processed preferred)
* ¼ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 6 tablespoons unsalted room temperature [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], cut into cubes
* 8 ounces dark bittersweet [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]], chopped
* ¾ cup white [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]] chips
* 5 large [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]], at room temperature (1 egg is for the topping)
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Granulated sugar|granulated sugar]]
* 1¼ cups (10 ounces) oatmeal stout [[Cookbook:Beer|beer]](room temperature)
* 1 cup semi-sweet [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]] chips

* 1 package (8 ounces) [[Cookbook:Cream Cheese|cream cheese]], softened 
* ⅓ cup [[Cookbook:Granulated sugar|granulated sugar]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]]

==Procedure==

# Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
# Line a 9 x 13-inch [[Cookbook:baking pan|baking pan]] with non-stick foil (or grease and flour - or parchment paper; your call).
# In a medium bowl, [[Cookbook:whisk|whisk]] together flour, cocoa powder, and salt until evenly combined. Set aside.
#Melt butter, bittersweet chocolate, and white chocolate chips in a [[Cookbook:Double Boiler|double boiler]] over very low heat, stirring constantly until melted. Remove from heat.
#In a large [[Cookbook:Mixing Bowl|mixing bowl]], [[Cookbook:beat|beat]] 4 of the eggs with the sugar on high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add melted chocolate mixture, beating until combined.
#Beat reserved flour mixture into melted chocolate mixture. Whisk in stout beer. The batter will seem a bit thin. Drop semisweet chocolate chips evenly on top of batter (some will sink in).
#Pour into prepared baking pan. 
#Beat cream cheese in medium bowl with [[Cookbook:Mixer|electric mixer]] on medium speed until smooth. Gradually beat in sugar. Beat in vanilla and the remaining egg just until blended.
#Pour cream cheese mixture over brownie batter in pan; cut through mixture with knife several times for marbled design.
#[[Cookbook:Baking|Bake]] 25 to 35 minutes on center rack in the oven, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out almost clean.
#Let brownies cool, uncovered, to room temperature. Dust with [[Cookbook:confectioners' sugar|confectioners' sugar]] before serving if desired.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Makes 18 (cut ~ 2x3 inch) to 24 (cut ~ 2x2 inch) if cut to dessert size. For finger-food/snack portions you could halve the above dimensions to get 36-48 brownies.
* Plating suggestion: swirl a raspberry lambic reduction sauce (12 oz lambic [reduced to half], 4-6 oz seedless raspberry purée, 2-4 oz turbinado sugar, ½-1 teaspoon corn starch) on the plate, garnish with mint leaves, raspberries, lemon zest.

This tasty dish is usually baked under meat, and is thus made. 

Beat 4 large spoonful of [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]], 2 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]], and a little [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] for fifteen minutes, add in small increments, 1500ml (3 pints) of [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]], and mix them well together. If you add the milk all at once, the mixture may [[Wikipedia:Curdle|curdle]]. Butter a dripping-pan, and set it on an oven shelf below the [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]], [[Cookbook:Mutton|mutton]], or [[Cookbook:Veal|veal]], while roasting. When it is brown, cut it into square pieces, and turn it over, and, when the under side is browned also, send it to the table on a dish.

==Ingredients==
A more modern recipe, to make 4 individual Yorkshire puddings.
* 4 oz (110g) plain [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1 large [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
* 1/2 British pint (10 fl oz = 284 ml) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 1/4 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* dripping from roast meat or sunflower oils
* bun or large muffin tin

==Procedure==
Sift the flour into a bowl and add the salt. Mix the egg into the milk, then add this mix piecewise to the flour, beating with a balloon whisk until all the milk is added and the mixture is well beaten. For best results refrigerate the batter for 1 hour.

Place a little of the dripping or oil into each division of the tin and place the tin in the oven to heat (usually the roast joint will still be in the oven), but if cooking separately heat the oven to 200 to 220 degrees Centigrade / Gas mark 7. Once the tin is smoking hot, fill each division with the batter and return to the oven. Remove and serve when risen, firm and brown.

Note: If your egg is small use two eggs and less milk otherwise the pudding will not rise.

Dining last night at 407 my two friends and I had an incredible appetizer.  The restaurant is very good but this dish alone may justify its existence.  We asked the waiter what went into the dish and a few minutes later the chef came out.  He sat down and was happy to outline the dish for us.

*[[Cookbook:Lemon Pepper|lemon pepper]]
*[[Cookbook:Paprika|hot paprika]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*¼ cup [[Cookbook:Wine|white wine]]
*½ cup [[Cookbook:Stock|chicken stock]]

==Procedure==
#Cut 16 3&quot;x½&quot; strips of chicken.
#Wash and dry mushrooms.
#[[Cookbook:Mincing|Mince]] the mushroom until very fine.
#Mix flour, ⅔ of the minced mushrooms, salt, black pepper, and a pinch of crumbled rosemary.
#Heat a large frying pan with a small amount of oil and a pinch of black pepper.
#Roll the chicken strips in the flour mixture and fry.
#While the chicken is frying, mix (preferably grind) together:
#*½ tsp lemon pepper
#*½ tsp black pepper
#*¼ tsp rosemary
#*dash hot paprika
#*dash salt
#Remove the chicken and set aside.
#Deglaze the pan with the wine. Add the spice mix and the remaining mushrooms.
#Reduce for a minute or two, then add stock.
#Reduce to a sauce consistency.
#On each plate stack 4 chicken strips and spoon 1 to 2 tbsps of sauce on top.

Serves four

{{recipesummary

}}

Along with [[Cookbook:Phở gà|Phở gà]], '''Phở bò''' could easily be called Vietnam's national dish. Most often served in the early morning, it is available on any street corner, everywhere in Vietnam, all day, and is a staple of most Vietnamese restaurants outside of the country. The broth is the star of this meal and can vary from North to South and is in some cases a closely guarded family secret. Experimenting with the ingredients is a must as long as they are traditionally South-East Asian in origin.

==Ingredients==
;For broth:
* 2 large white [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]] - chopped into quarters
* 1 tablespoon of [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|vegetable]] or [[Cookbook:Peanut Oil|peanut oil]]
* 5 lbs of [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] bones (choose ones with a bit of meat on them)
* 1 small knob of [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]] - chopped
* 2 medium [[Cookbook:Daikon|daikon]] (white radish) - chopped into quarters
* 1 small [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon stick]]
* 4 [[Cookbook:Cardamom|cardamom]] pods - whole
* 4 [[Cookbook:Cloves|cloves]] - whole
* 1 [[Cookbook:Star anise|Star Anise]]
* 1 tablespoon whole black [[Cookbook:Pepper|peppercorn]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] cloves - peeled

;For serving:
* Phở noodles (broad rice noodle) - soaked in hot water until soft and drained
* Finely sliced white onion
* Finely sliced [[Cookbook:Green onion|scallions]]
* Chopped [[Cookbook:Cilantro|coriander leaf]]
* Finely sliced beef sirloin (ask your butcher)

'''Note:''' Traditionally, the Vietnamese prefer fatty meat in their soup. Some other serving ingredients include [[w:Tendon|beef tendon]], [[w:Beef shank|beef shank]], [[Cookbook:Tripe|beef tripe]] and meatballs.

;Condiments:
* [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|Chili peppers]] - whole
* [[Cookbook:Bean Sprout|Bean sprouts]]
* [[Cookbook:Lime|Limes]] - cut into wedges
* [[Cookbook:Basil|Thai Basil]]
* [[Cookbook:Fish Sauce|Nước mắm]]
* [[Cookbook:Hot Sauce|Hot sauce]]
* [[Cookbook:Hoisin Sauce|Hoisin sauce]]
* Black pepper

==Procedure==

# Fry onions in oil until lightly browned. Remove and drain. Rinse the beef bones, place in a stockpot, cover with cold water, and bring slowly to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 10-15 minutes. For a clear broth skim off foam.
# After this initial cooking, add cooked onions, ginger, carrots, cinnamon, cardamom, star anise, cloves, garlic and peppercorns. Bring to a boil again and gently simmer the stock, partially covered, for a minimum of 6 hours but up to 12 hours if you can, skimming regularly. If necessary, add more water to keep the bones covered.
# Strain stock to remove the vegetable and spices and discard them. Return the broth to the stove to keep it boiling hot.

==Preparing==
In a large soup bowl, place a handful of cooled Phở noodles, top with thinly sliced raw beef, and ladle on generous amounts of steaming hot broth, which will cook the raw beef. Garnish with sliced onions, scallions and coriander, and serve immediately.

==Serving==
Place condiments on a large serving plate. It's not necessary to add any of the condiments to the soup, but adding a few basil leaves, a squeeze of lime, and some bean sprouts, is customary.

Many Vietnamese will also take small bites of very hot chili peppers while eating the soup to spice up the meal. Proceed with caution!

The fish sauce, hot sauce, and hoisin sauce, can either be added directly into the soup or placed in a small bowl for dipping the meat and noodles.

Enjoy!

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe|Pho ga}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Vietnam|Cuisine of Vietnam]]

'''Pho Ga''' is one of the culinary gems of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Vietnam|Vietnamese cuisine]], available within a mile radius of almost every person in the community of Little Saigon, a Vietnamese enclave located in Orange County, California. Although the flavors are complex, the technique is simple, and the result is delectable.  

== Ingredients ==
* &quot;Pho&quot; noodles*

=== Broth ===
* 1 small to medium [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] (whole)
* 12 cups chicken broth
* 3-4 slices of fresh [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]] (whole)
* 1 medium brown [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], peeled (whole)
* 1 tbsp of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] or more (to taste)
* Fish sauce, to taste*

===Seasoning Pouch===
* 1 tsp. fennel seed
* 1 tsp. peppercorns
* 3 whole star anise*
* 1-2 dried cardamom pods*
* 1/2 stick cinnamon
* 3 whole cloves

===Finishing Touches===

* Diced cilantro and green onion
* A few fresh basil leaves, torn
* Fresh bean sprouts
* Thinly sliced brown or white onion (several pieces per serving)
* Hoisin Sauce (1 tsp per serving, or to taste)*
* Lime (squeezed into broth before eating)
* Jalapenos, serranos, or other chilli peppers
* Sriracha or similar chilli sauce
* Additional fish sauce

'''Note:''' All ingredients, particularly those marked with asterisks, can be found in Asian markets and some large supermarkets

== Procedure ==
# Combine ingredients for seasoning pouch  in a small strainer or a pouch made from cheesecloth and twine.
# In a large stock pot, boil broth ingredients together with seasoning pouch until the chicken is thoroughly cooked
# Remove the chicken and strain broth back into the pot for additional simmering. Once the chicken is cool, pull apart the meat into bite sized pieces and discard bones.
# In a separate pot, boil the &quot;Pho&quot; noodles in sufficient water. Stop when they're no longer chewy (basically the way you'd boil spaghetti). Make sure you don't overdo it or the noodles will fall apart and you'll end up with porridge. When done, pour the noodles into a colander and rinse them with lukewarm water. Then, leave them to drain.  
# Once the noodles have drained, add them to a bowl. Combine the chicken, &quot;finishing touches&quot; (see above), and enough broth to cover the noodles.  Enjoy with fork (chopsticks if you want the authentic experience) and a spoon.

'''Bún bò Huế''' is a popular Vietnamese soup noodle dish which originated in the old imperial capital of Huế.

'''Ingredients for broth:'''
* 1 kg [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef_shank beef shank] with cartilage – sliced into 2mm think pieces. Ask your butcher. Chop the shank slices into various shapes of about 4cm x 4cm.
* 2 medium sized pigs feet – fresh, cut into 1 cm pieces. Discard the feet themselves
* 4 tablespoons Huế [[Cookbook:Shrimp Paste|shrimp paste]]
* 1 small onion – finely chopped
* 2 stalks of [[Cookbook:Lemongrass|lemongrass]] – chopped into 5-inch pieces
* 1 kg [[Cookbook:Rice Noodle|rice noodles]] – a noodle resembling spaghetti No 5. is preferred
* [[Cookbook:Fish Sauce|Nước mắm]]
* Sugar
* Red pigment powder – non-spicy for coloring
* [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|Chili powder]]
* Vegetable oil

'''Serving ingredients:'''
* 1 bunch of [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]] – stems discarded and leaves chopped
* 1 bunch of Italian (flat leaf) [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]] – stems discarded and leaves chopped
* 1 medium onion – finely chopped

'''Condiments:'''
* [[Cookbook:Lime|Limes]] - cut into wedges
* Fresh [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|Chili peppers]]
* [[Cookbook:Bean Sprout|Bean sprouts]]
* [[Cookbook:Banana Blossom|Banana blossom]] - thinly sliced
* Shrimp paste

'''Materials:'''
* A large stockpot - 8-10 litres
* A large mixing bowl - 2.5 litres
* A small frying pan

==Directions==
Start by preparing the shrimp paste. In a large bole, 2.5 litres, add shrimp paste and slowly pour in cold water while vigorously stirring the paste. Keep adding water and stirring until you’ve almost reached the rim of the bowl. Don’t let it spill over. Let the paste mixture rest in the bowl for 1.5 hours, to allow the mixture to settle.

'''Note:''' ''Shrimp Paste is essential to this dish and cannot be considered Bún bò Huế without it. Different types of shrimp paste can be found all over Vietnam. Some are of better quality than others. Some purists believe that only Huế shrimp paste is acceptable for this dish as it is smoother and of superior quality than other pastes, which can have trace amounts of sand in them. Unfortunately, it can be hard to find outside of Vietnam, so an &quot;inferior&quot; paste may be substituted.''

Sauté the small onion in 3 tbsp of oil until golden brown. In your stockpot, combine the cooked onion and pigs feet with 2 litres of water. Slowly bring it to the boil over medium heat. Add lemongrass and '''SLOWLY''' and '''CAREFULLY''' pour in the shrimp paste mixture making sure to only add the clear liquid not the silt that has settled at the bottom of the bowl. To the residual shrimp paste, add another litre of water and stir. Again, wait until the mixture has settled before adding it into the stockpot. Simmer the stock for 20 minutes.

Add the beef and occasionally skim the broth to ensure you get a nice clear liquid. Cook for another 20 minutes, checking the beef to be sure it’s not overcooked. Add fish sauce and sugar to taste to achieve a nice balance between salty and sweet.

While the broth is cooking, heat some oil in a pan and add the red pigment. Cook until the pigment is blended with the oil. Add to the stock. Repeat the process with the chili powder.

==Preparing==
Combine chopped parsley and coriander leaves with the uncooked medium onion.

If you are using fresh noodles, simply add boiling water to heat them up. If you’re using dried noodles, soak them in boiling water until they are soft then dip in cold water to stop the cooking process. Do not over cook them or you’ll have mush. Dried noodles have already been cooked.

In a large soup bowl, place a handful of noodles, top with a handful of the parsley/coriander/onion mixture, and ladle on generous amounts of steaming hot broth, ensuring there are several pieces of beef and pork.

==Serving==
You can add a squeeze of lime and chopped fresh chilies if you like your food extra spicy. It is also common to add a small dollop of shrimp paste to the soup, but those unfamiliar with the taste may not like it.

Brazilian cheese balls. Typically served as a snack, or a side dish in a ''churrascaria'' (barbecue restaurant). Plural, ''pães de queijo''.

==Ingredients==

* 2/3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (160ml) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 1/3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (80ml) [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] (Canola works well; do NOT use olive oil)
* 2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] (450g) [[Cookbook:Manioc Flour|Manioc flour]], [[Cookbook:Tapioca Starch|tapioca flour]] makes a good substitute
* 6 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounces]] (170 [[Cookbook:Gram|grams]]) of hard cheese (Cheddar, Parmesan)
* 2 eggs (egg substitute like &quot;Egg Beaters&quot; is ok too)
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste

==Preparation==
#Mix the milk, water and oil together into a pan, and boil until a white foam appears.
#Gradually add flour to this hot mixture; mix well to form a firm ball with no lumps.
#Let the dough rest for 15 minutes.
#Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
#Mix in the eggs and the cheese (plus the salt and pepper) to the dough. The dough will become sticky and wet. If the dough is too wet, add more flour and cheese in order to make firmer balls (instead of cookies).
#Grease your hands, and form small balls 1 - 2 inch in diameter.
#Place the balls on a greased baking tray.
#Cook for 15 - 20 minutes, until the top begins to brown.
#Makes about 20 ''pães''.

'''Øllebrød''' (Danish for ''Beer Bread'') is a Danish bread porridge, easily made from (dry) [[Cookbook:Rye bread|rye bread]] using this very simple recipe.

Øllebrød, together with [[Cookbook:Salmon|salmon]] (and other [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]]), [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]], rye bread, [[Cookbook:Beer|beer]] and [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], was an important nutritional element of traditional Danish cuisine until the 1800s. 

A Danish family usually had a big pot on the stove in which they threw leftover bread and beer dregs. This was served as an everyday meal, morning and afternoon. The pot was seldom emptied, so it was a kind of continuous meal.

==Ingredients==
*day-old [[Cookbook:Rye bread|rye bread]]
*[[Cookbook:Beer|beer]] -  preferably a sweet dark stout

==Procedure==
Take some amount of rye bread and put it to soak in [[Cookbook:Beer|beer]] for 6&amp;ndash;12 hours. Feel free to use whatever beer that is the cheapest, the alcohol is going to vaporise anyway.

Let it boil slowly for about 1 hour. Add more beer if it's too dry, the consistency should be like that of [[Cookbook:Oatmeal|oatmeal]]. If you want it sweet you can mix in some [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] or [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]]. For a fresher taste, add a touch of [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]].

Serve with [[Cookbook:Whipped cream|whipped cream]] if you're introducing this meal to someone who is not Danish.

'''Switchel''', also known as '''Ginger Water''', is a sweetened beverage made from ground [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]], [[Cookbook:Cider vinegar|apple cider vinegar]], sugar or other sweeteners and water.  It is a traditional drink on farms in the Northeastern United States, where it was made to soothe the thirsts of farm workers as well as (allegedly) boost one's stamina. It is served chilled, but is often served warmed in the Winter months.

==Ingredients==

*1 cup [[Cookbook:Sugar|Sugar]]
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Cider vinegar|Apple Cider Vinegar]]
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Ginger|Ground Ginger]]
*1 quart [[Cookbook:Water|Water]]

==Procedure==

# Dissolve sugar and ground ginger in the water.
# Stir in the apple cider vinegar
# Chill or serve over ice cubes.

==Variations==

Some traditional recipes have used [[Cookbook:Maple Syrup|maple syrup]], [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]] and/or [[Cookbook:Molasses|molasses]], separately or in combination, as sweeteners. The ratio of sweetener and vinegar to water vary widely in traditional and modern recipes. A small amount of [[Cookbook:Oatmeal|oatmeal]] is sometimes added to give the beverage more body and to add to the flavor.</text>

{{recipe}}

'''Crême anglaise''' is a delicious and versatile [[Cookbook:Dessert|dessert]] [[Cookbook:Sauces|sauce]]. It's easy to make and can be flavored in a variety of ways.

== Ingredients ==
*1⅓ cups [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*4 [[Cookbook:Egg yolk|egg yolk]]s
*3 oz [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*flavoring (typically a [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla bean]] or 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract)

== Procedure ==
#Bring the milk and flavoring to a simmer in a medium saucepan. (If using a vanilla bean, cut it lengthwise and add to the milk. After a short time and before the milk simmers, scrape the seeds from the inside of the beans and dispose of the husks.)
#Meanwhile, whisk the egg yolks and sugar thoroughly. The mixture should be pale yellow.
#When the milk simmers, remove from heat and SLOWLY pour about half of it into the egg mixture, mixing continuously. Pour the egg/milk mixture back into the saucepan with the remaining milk, stirring continuously, and return the saucepan to the eye.
#Cook for a short time over medium heat, stirring continuously. Be careful to scrape the sides and corners regularly, and ''do not'' let the mixture boil.
#Test for readiness by dipping a spatula into it and running your finger over the coated spatula. The creme is done when it is thick enough that the trail wiped away by your finger remains.
#Remove the saucepan from heat and strain it through a metal strainer into another bowl. Stir it continuously for another two minutes, cooling it.
#To complete cooling quickly, place the bowl in a larger bowl of ice and stir the creme until cool. If you have more time, you can place the bowl in the freezer, stirring periodically until it's cool. If you don't use one of these methods, a skin will form on top of the creme.

This recipe makes about 2 cups.

== Notes, tips and variations ==
* Uses of creme anglaise are numerous. A classic is to serve it over fresh [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]]. In this case, you may want to customize the flavoring to match your fruit (e.g., [[Cookbook:Mint|mint]] goes well with [[Cookbook:Strawberry|strawberries]] and [[Cookbook:Banana|bananas]]). You can also use the creme as the basis for a rich ice cream.
*Instead of vanilla, you can flavor the creme with a variety of things - [[Cookbook:Spices and herbs|herbs, spices]], spirits, and [[Cookbook:Coffee|coffee]] among them. For herbs or spices, simply add them to the milk as instructed in step one. For coffee or spirits, omit the flavoring initially and add espresso or spirits after the creme is cooled. Some common variations:
** Nut Creme Anglaise: Add ½ cup freshly toasted and broken nuts such as hazelnuts, black walnuts or pecans to the milk during the first step. Discard nuts after straining.
** Chocolate Creme Anglaise: Add ½ cup chopped fine-quality chocolate (bittersweet, chocolate or white) to the sauce. Stir until melted, then strain and proceed as for plain creme anglaise.
** Coffee Creme Anglaise: Add 2 tablespoons crushed espresso beans to the milk during the first step and proceed as for regular creme anglaise. Discard the crushed coffee after straining.
** Herb- or Spice-Infused Creme Anglaise: Add a fresh herb such as rosemary, mint or lavender to the milk in the first step, or 1 tablespoon of a spice such as cinnamon, cloves, juniper berries or green cardamom, broken up. Discard the herbs or spices after straining.
** Fruit Creme Anglaise: Add 2 tablespoons of fresh fruit purée to the creme anglaise after it's cooked but before it's strained.

'''Butter chicken''' or '''murgh makhani''' is an [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] dish popular in countries all over the world where Indian restaurants are found. The dish was invented by accident at Moti Mahal Restaurant in Daryaganj, New Delhi.  While the dish's general recipe is well known, the actual flavor can vary from restaurant to restaurant even within Delhi.

It is a dish made by [[Cookbook:Marinating|marinating]] a chicken overnight in a yoghurt and [[Cookbook:Spices and herbs|spice]] mixture. The chicken is then roasted or baked.

A sauce is made from butter, tomatoes, [[Cookbook:almond|almond]]s and various spices, usually including the famous tandoori masala spice mix, and sometimes cream.  Once the sauce is prepared, the marinated and roasted chicken is chopped and added to it.

{{see also|Cookbook:Chicken Tikka Masala}}

==Ingredients==

*2 tablespoons of [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*1 large [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*¼ teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]] (optional)
*2-3 cloves of crushed [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
*2 teaspoons of grated [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
*1 teaspoon of ground [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]]
*1 tablespoon of ground [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]]
*2-3 teaspoons of [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|chilli powder]]
*50g [[Cookbook:Tandoori masala|tandoori masala]] powder 
*400-500 grams of skinless, boneless [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] thighs or breasts (chicken on the bone, this will probably be 800 g) 
*100-200g [[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomato paste]]
*100g [[Cookbook:Cream|full cream]]
*1 small [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]] or [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]]
*½ cup of unsweetened [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yoghurt]]

==Procedure==
# Trim and cut the chicken into small cubes. (Cooks who prefer chicken on the bone, put long thin slices laterally into the chicken) 
# In a big bowl add Tandoori powder, yogurt and squeeze in lemon juice. Massage this well with your hands so that all the chicken is evenly covered in the Tandoori powder. Cover and put aside for at least ½ an hour. 
# With a clean knife or electric chopper slice the onions very finely. 
# Heat a large saucepan or frying pan for 5 minutes or until evenly hot (whichever is first).  
# In the pan melt 2 tablespoons of butter until it is frothy. Add the onions and the cinnamon to the pan and fry lightly. When the onions are soft and starting to brown, stir in the crushed garlic and ginger. Then add the turmeric, chili and coriander, and sauté over a medium heat.  
# Add the cubed chicken and [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sauté]], stirring constantly until the chicken has turned white. This doesn't take long so make sure you don't overcook the chicken. 
# Pour in the tomato paste. Mix thoroughly.  Add the cream and heat through. After adding the cream and stirring, you may add additional tandoori masala. About 3-5 tablespoons full is generally sufficient.
# Cover and simmer for just over 10 minutes.

==Ingredients==
* 1 kg. lean [[Cookbook:Mincing|mince]] ([[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] or [[Cookbook:Lamb|lamb]])
* 3 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], skinned and thinly sliced
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]
* 1 tbsp. [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]] paste
* 2 tbsp. unripe green [[Cookbook:Papaya|papaya]] (ground)
* 1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Garam Masala|garam masala]]
* 1½ tsp. [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 7-8 whole [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|red chilli]]
* 2 tbsp. [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]]

* 2 tbsp. freshly chopped [[Cookbook:Cilantro|green coriander]] (cilantro)
* 1 tsp. finely chopped [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|green chillies]]
* 1 tbsp. roasted [[Cookbook:Chickpea|chickpea flour]]

==Procedure==
# Heat oil in a heavy based sauce pan. Add onions and stirring frequently, fry for 8-10 minutes to a light golden color. Remove onions from oil and fry the whole chillies just for a moment, otherwise they will burn. Reserve the oil and put the onions and whole chillies in a chopper or food processor and blend to a smooth paste without using water.
# Thoroughly wash the mince and squeeze out any water. 
# Put the mince in a bowl. Add onion paste, ginger paste, salt, garam masala and yogurt. Knead the mixture really well for a few minutes with your hands until it is smooth.
# Cover and leave to marinate at room temperature for about 3-4 hours or overnight in the refrigerator. One hour before cooking mix in the ground papaya.
# Put the charcoal over medium flame, wait until the coal is fully red and is covered by white ash.  
# Meanwhile place the mince in a metal pan. Make a well in the center. Put a small piece of aluminum foil in it. Place the burned coal over it and put 2-3 drops of oil on it. Cover it at once with a tight fitting lid and put aside for 20-25 minutes.
# Take out ½ cup of oil from the reserved oil. Reheat the oil in a heavy based pan. Discard the charcoal and fry the mince over low heat for 4-5 minutes. Cover with a tight fitting lid and cook for 15-20 minutes or until all excess moisture has absorbed.
# Transfer to a serving dish and decorate with onion ring, green chilli and coriander leaves.

Although the '''Tipitapa''' recipe is a secret, this is the most common substitute to it.

==Ingredients==
* 5 spoonfuls [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|virgin olive oil]]
* whole 8oz - 1lb (225g - 450g) [[Cookbook:Fish|carp fish]]

===Salsa===
* ½ an [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 3 oz (85g) [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]]
* [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]
* natural (fruit) [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
* 1-2 spoonfuls virgin olive oil

==Procedure==
# Fry half a yellow onion (vidalia onions are OK but purple or white onions are also acceptable). 
# When the onion is transparent, add a 3 ounces tomato cut in rings and cook for five minutes then add a drop or two of vinegar and a pinch of brown sugar. Let it cook for a few more minutes and save.
# Use a carp fish (8 ounces to 1 pound) per serving. The fish must be fresh and the skin clean of scales but intact. The contents of the fish must be emptied (abdominal clean up). It is possible to use previously frozen fish but fresh unfrozen catch is preferable.
# In five spoonfuls of virgin olive oil (to substitute Nicaraguan virgin oils) or the same amount of your favorite cooking oil that is already heated, fry one side of the fish until the skin is crispy (approximately 7 minutes per side) then put in the oven on pan with rack to cook at 350°F (175°C) during 15 minutes.
# Let the fish cool, then salt as wanted and return to its pan. Fry again for 3 minutes each side low flame while re-heating the salsa, then add the salsa on top and serve.

A '''Jamaican patty''' is a street food that contains various fillings and spices baked inside a flaky pastry shell. As its name suggests, it is commonly found in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Jamaica|Jamaica]], and is also eaten in other areas of the [[Cookbook:Caribbean cuisines|Caribbean]]. It is traditionally filled with [[Cookbook:Mincing|ground]] [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]], or with ground [[Cookbook:Mutton|mutton]] or [[Cookbook:Goat|goat]], and fillings also include [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]], [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]], [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]] and [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]]. Patties following recipes with [[Cookbook:Halal|halal]] meats or vegetable based substitutes can also be found.

In recent years, the Jamaican meat patty can be found pre-made and frozen in Great Britain and North America, primarily Canada.

Conventionally, patties are marked with a colored dot on the crust to indicate the filling:
*no dot: ground beef
*red dot: chicken
*green dot: vegetables (often not vegetarian, containing animal suet, tallow, and/or other animal ingredients; vegetarians must inquire whether recipes are suitable for their diets)

Here is a common recipe provided for Jamaican Beef Patty.

==Ingredients==
===Filling===
*2 lbs ground [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] 
*2 bundles fresh [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]]
*1 tsp [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]]
*half a loaf of French bread 
*½ tsp Island Spice Scotch Bonnet Pepper Soya Sauce
*2 oz [[Cookbook:Green onion|scallion or spring onion]]
*1 tsp [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] 

===Pastry===
*2 cups [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*½ teaspoon salt
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]]
*1 cup cold water
*1 teaspoon ground [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]] (or 1/2 teaspoon Jamaican Curry Powder and ½ teaspoon annatto for coloring)
*Beef filling for patties 
*½ cup [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]

==Procedure==

===Filling===
#Grind escallion and Island Spice Scotch Bonnet Pepper Soya sauce. 
#Add to ground beef with salt. 
#Add thyme.
#Cook beef.
#While beef is cooking, pour cold water over bread in a saucepan to cover and soak for a few minutes, squeeze dry saving the water. 
#Pass bread through mincing mill and return the ground bread to the water with thyme and cook until bread is dry. Combine meat and cooked bread. 
#Add paprika and cook for 20 minutes. 
#Remove from heat. 
#Allow to cool. 

===Pastry===
#Sift flour, turmeric (for coloring), salt and knead in lard.
#Bind with water to form a firm dough and knead for 2 minutes. 
#Roll pastry 1/8 inches thick. 
#Cut pastry round 6 inches.
#For extra patty crust flakiness, roll out brush with lard, fold over and roll again. Do this about 3 times. 
#Divide beef filling between patties, brush edges with water. 
#Fold over and seal glaze with milk. 
#Bake on top shelf of oven for about 25 mins. at 450 degrees until golden brown

A '''Lane Cake''' is a baked cake traditional in the [[Cookbook:Southern cuisine|American South]]. A traditional Lane cake is a layered white cake. The outside usually has a white frosting. Each layer has different ingredients. For example, one layer may have pecans and coconut, the next layer almonds. Due to the complicated preparations and multiple ingredients, Lane cakes are considered difficult to make.

==Ingredients==

* ½ lb (225g) butter, at room temperature
* 2 c (480g) sugar
* 3½ c (525g) all-purpose [[Cookbook:flour|flour]]

*1kg of [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Lemon|citrons]] (lemons)
*5g (1 tsp) [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]]
*[[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]]

==Procedure==
# Boil 2 liters of water. 
# Wash the citrons well and peel them into the container you will making your mead in. 
# Add the honey into the container with the peels. 
# Pour the boiling water on top, and mix well.
# Add 3 liters of cold water so that the mixture will be lukewarm. 
# Add a very small piece of yeast and slice the citrons into the mix, carefully removing the white part. 
# Let it stand overnight. 
# When you are ready to bottle it, add one spoonful of sugar and a few raisins to the bottle before you pour the mead in.
# After bottling, let the bottles stand at room temperature for a few more days. 
# Finally, move the bottles to your refrigerator. The mead is ready, and should be served cold.

==Notes, tips and variations==

[[Image:Appleturnover.JPG|240px|right|thumb|Apple turnover, made with puff pastry]]

In [[Cookbook:baking|baking]], '''puff pastry''' (French: '''''pâte feuilletée''''') is a light, flaky [[Cookbook:pastry|pastry]] made from [[w:en:Dough|dough]] of the same name. The dough, which is also called ''puff paste'', consists of many layers of fat sandwiched between layers of dough.&lt;ref name=Gisslen&gt;Gisslen, Wayne (2001) ''Professional Baking'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, ISBN 0-471-34646-2&lt;/ref&gt; Although ''Larousse Gastronomique'',&lt;ref&gt;''Larousse Gastronomique'' (1938), (1961 English translation), Crown Publishers, New York&lt;/ref&gt; and some other writers,&lt;ref name=Gisslen/&gt;  use the terms interchangeably, traditionally in the English language, the term puff pastry is distinguished from the term '''flaky pastry''', in the way in which the [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]] (fat) is folded into the dough.&lt;ref&gt;''The Concise Household Encyclopedia'', (1933), Amalgamated Press, London&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cookbook:Croissant|Croissant]]s are sometimes formed from puff pastry. Puff pastry shells used to be filled with [[Cookbook:crab|crab]] meat salad or [[Cookbook:chicken à la king|chicken à la king]] at ladies' luncheons. An [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|American]] fashion in the late 1970s was to bake a wedge of [[Cookbook:Brie Cheese|Brie]] in puff pastry and serve warm. [[Cookbook:Choux Pastry|Choux pastry]], used to make [[Cookbook:Cream Puff|cream puff]]s, is different, using eggs. [[Cookbook:Bourekas|Bourekas]] is also made out of puff pastry, filled with various ingredients.

There are several ways to make puff pastries below.

==Notes on baking and storing puff pastry==
Puff pastry is cooked when the bottom of the item is browned and the pastry does not collapse into itself.

*Use a very sharp knife to cut puff pastry. A blunt knife will crush the layers together and prevent the pastry from rising to full height.
*Do not get egg wash or milk wash on the sides of the pastry. This will glue the layers together during baking and result in uneven lift.
*Excess flour left on the item will burn easily in the oven. Dust it off with a soft pastry brush.
*Always bake puff pastry in a very hot oven ([[Cookbook:Oven temperatures|220°C/425°F]]). A hot oven ensures the moisture in the dough turns into steam, which is what makes puff pastry rise.
*Open the oven flue during baking to allow steam to escape and the pastry to dry, or failing that, open the oven door near the end of the baking.
*Puff pastry can be refrigerated for a week, or frozen for three months. Stored puff pastry will have less lift than fresh pastry.

==Method 1==
===Ingredients===
*1 [[Cookbook:Pound|pound]] [[Cookbook:flour|flour]]
*1 pound [[Cookbook:butter|butter]]
* [[Cookbook:water|water]]

===Directions===

#Sift the flour.
#Divide the butter into four parts.
#Cut one part of the butter into the flour with a knife. 
#Make the butter and flour into dough with water.
#Roll the dough.
#Flake the dough with part of the butter.
#Flake until all the butter is in.
#You have made enough crust for at least ten puffs.
#Bake with a quick heat for 10 to 15 minutes.

==Method 2==
===Ingredients===

*2 [[Cookbook:quart|quart]]s (2.2 liters) flour
*1 pound butter
* cold water

Take a quarter of peck of flour, and rub it into a pound of butter very fine. Make it up into a light paste with cold water just stiff enough to work it up. Then lay it out about as thick as a silver dollar; put a layer of butter all over, then sprinkle on a little flour, double it up, and roll it out again. Double and roll it with layers of butter three times, and it will be fit for use.

==Method 3 (German method)==
===Ingredients===

*500g white flour
*250g water
*400g butter (or [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]])

Mix flour, water and 50g gram butter to make a dough. Knead well. Roll dough into a ball. Make a deep cut through the middle, and a second cut at a right angle again through the middle. Roll out the resulting four ends to about half the thickness of the base. It should now have the form of an equilateral cross. Stir butter until soft. Spread onto the middle part of the cross forming approximately a cube. Now take each end of the &quot;cross&quot;, lift it, and put it on the top of the butter cube, literally wrapping it up like a gift. Cover in plastic foil and refrigerate overnight.

Take dough and start rolling it out. Always move in one direction. During the whole process, use as little flour as possible. Gently remove excessive flour with a brush. Roll out to about 10cm. Then perform a so-called &quot;simple tour&quot;: take one end of the dough and fold it two-thirds of the dough's length toward the other end. Now, take the other end and fold it the opposite way. You should now have three layers of dough. Roll out again , but move the rolling pin along the folded sides (ie turn the dough 45 degrees). Repeat process up to 5 times. The more often you do this, the more layers you will get, the fluffier the dough will turn out.

== Flaky Pastry ==
'''Flaky Pastry''' is also known as &quot;Quick Puff Pastry&quot;.
===Ingredients===
* 460 g butter, divided into four equal portions
* 460 g all-purpose flour

===Method===
# Sift flour into a bowl
# Cut one portion of butter into the flour till becomes crumbly.
# Add cold water, as needed, to make a dough.
# Lightly dust kneading board and rolling pin with flour.  Roll dough till it is approximately half a centimetre thick.
# Cut (smear) another portion of butter into the pastry.  Fold pastry into quarters.  Roll pastry back to a half a centimetre thickness. Repeat this step till there is no butter left.
#Draw a sheet of plastic food wrap large enough to cover one side of the flattened pastry. Invert the kneading board. 
#Cover the other side with another sheet of plastic food wrap. Gently roll the pastry into a cylindrical shape. 
#Store in refrigerator until needed for use. Keeps well for a week or 6 months in freezer.

==Modernisation: Filo Puff Pastry==
===Ingredients===
* 2 and ⅓ cups plain (non&amp;ndash;self-raising) flour  
* Additional flour for dusting
* 450 g butter, diced  
* 550 g butter
* chilled water

===Method===
# In a bowl, mix the first measure of flour and diced butter, until it becomes a fine crumb.
# Add to the crumb, a little at a time, ice cold water until it becomes a very stiff dough.
# Lightly dust the kneading board and rolling pin with flour.
# Roll the pastry dough to the thickness of parchment paper, or thinner if possible.
# Coat all of the visible dough with smears of butter.  Sprinkle the pastry with a light dusting of flour, then fold in half.
* While coating the dough in butter, keep the rolling pin as cool as possible.  Either place a tea towel over the rolling pin, then a cold pack on top, or place the rolling pin in the freezer if near by.
# Repeat steps #4. and #5. at least another two more times.  At most, repeat another six times.  Work as quickly and efficiently as possible.
#Draw a sheet of plastic food wrap large enough to cover one side of the flattened pastry. Invert the kneading board. 
#Cover the other side with another sheet of plastic food wrap. Gently roll the pastry into a cylindrical shape. 
#Store in refrigerator until needed for use. Keeps well for a maximum of one day.

==Classic Puff Pastry==
===Ingredients===

* 2½ lbs (40 oz) Bread Flour (1125g)
* ½ oz Salt (15g)
* 1½ lbs (24 oz) Cold Water (775g)
* 2½ lbs (40 oz) Room Temp Butter (1125g)
* 4 oz Bread Flour (115g)

===Method===
# Mix the salt in with the larger portion of flour.
# Add the cold water to the flour and salt and work it into a dough.
# Knead about 80 times to make a soft dough and build some gluten.
# Flatten out the dough (allows quicker cooling) and refrigerate.
# Combine the room temperature butter and the smaller portion of flour and mix well.  It will form a soft paste that is easy to spread.
# Take the chilled dough and roll it into a rectangle about ¼-½ inch thick.
# Leaving a one inch margin around the edge, spread the butter out over ⅔rds of the dough.
# Fold the dough into thirds like you were folding a letter, starting with the portion of dough with no butter.
# Refrigerate for 20-30 minutes to allow the dough to relax, and so the butter doesn't get displaced when rolling out again.
# Roll out the dough again to a large rectangle the same size as the first.
# Fold the dough so that the two short edges meet in the center and then fold the dough in half.  This should give the dough four layers and is, as a result, called a four-fold.
# Refrigerate the dough again and then roll out and do another four-fold.  Repeat this step two more times.  You now have classical puff pastry dough to use as you see please.

===Notes===
# Always always always salt your dough.  It's not enough to be noticeable but it will help bring out the flavors of the butter and dough and whatever you decide to put in the puff dough.
# The dough can be refrigerated for five to seven days.  It will often take on a greyish tinge once it's getting old and it should then be thrown away.
# Freezing dough generally isn't a good idea, but for something like this it's manageable.  The water crystals that form can destroy the gluten that was formed while kneading and rolling and can lead to an improper rise while baking.  Be sure to let the dough thaw completely and get to room temperature before rolling out and using.  If you roll it out too early the butter will form spotty chunks within the dough which can tear your dough and cause it to rise unevenly in the oven.
# Do not be afraid to add flour or water to your dough if you find it too sticky or dry.  Location and humidity can alter the amount of moisture a dough needs to be just right.
# Extra bread flour was added to the butter to help absorb any excess moisture in your dough and product.  It will also help prevent a soggy baked good.
# A little French terminology; the flour and butter mixture is called a Berrauge and the dough is called a Detremp.

'''Rocky Road''' is an [[Cookbook:Ice Cream|ice cream]] flavor, second only to [[Cookbook:vanilla|vanilla]] in popularity in the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|United States]]. Though there are variations on the flavor, it is traditionally composed of chocolate ice cream, [[Cookbook:Nuts and seeds|nuts]] and marshmallows. The flavor is claimed to have been created in 1929 by William Dreyer when he cut up [[Cookbook:walnut|walnuts]] and marshmallows with his wife's sewing scissors and added them to his chocolate ice cream during the Great Depression. The company claims it was then so named &quot;to give folks something to smile about in the midst of the Great Depression.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.dreyersinc.com/about/WebHistory.pdf| title = Dreyer's History| accessdate = April 5|accessyear = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternately, Fenton's Creamery in Oakland, California, claims that William Dreyer based his recipe on a Rocky Road ice cream invented by his friend, Fenton's George Farren, who blended his Rocky Road candy bar into ice cream; however Dreyer substituted [[Cookbook:almond|almond]]s for walnuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.fentonscreamery.com/blender.html| title = Fenton's Blender Club:Rocky Road Ice Cream| accessdate = April 5| accessyear = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*1 cup miniature [[Cookbook:marshmallow|marshmallow]]s
*½ cup chopped [[Cookbook:Almond|almonds]] or [[Cookbook:Pecan|pecans]]

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Germany|Germany]]

One has to eat [[Cookbook:Spaetzle|Spätzle]] with the [[Cookbook:Lentil|lentils]].

Best procedure is to prepare the dough before you cook the lentils, and afterwards you cook the Spätzle.

This one is a slightly modified recipe, the traditional one has no tomato and honey.
But as on many &quot;national meals&quot; there is are different opinions.
The best is to try around until you got your own best taste for it.

The most important things for a traditional taste is the vinegar and the bay (laurel) leaves.

==Ingredients==

* 250 grams [[Cookbook:Lentil|brown lentils]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]]
* 2-3 [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* 2 pairs of [[Cookbook:Scalding|scalded]] [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausage]]
* 1 large piece of [[Cookbook:Smoking|smoked]] [[Cookbook:Pork|pork belly]]
* 2 cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* 1 litre of [[Cookbook:Water|water]] for the lentils
*: it's needed to make the sauce, so don't use more water.
* 40 g [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* 40 g [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* ½ litre [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomato paste]]
* 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Wine vinegar|red wine vinegar]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]]
* about 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* one or more [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay (laurel) leaves]]

==Equipment==

* A medium sized pot
* A small pot
* A sieve

==Procedure==

===Lentils===
# Wash the lentils in sieve and cook them on small heat in one litre water for 40 to 50 minutes (there are already done lentils to buy, and dry lentils etc. so best check instructions on the lentils package).
# 20 minutes before the end of that time frame add the diced carrot and onion plus the peeled raw potatoes, also the garlic, the sausages (full or in pieces), the bay (laurel) leaves and the pork belly.
# After those 20 minutes, put the pot on the side and keep it warm.

===Roux===

# Melt the butter in the little pot, add the flour and cook carefully until brown, keep stirring.
# Slowly add the half litre of water in small portions and let it boil up once.
# Add the tomato paste, the vinegar and honey, and spice with salt and pepper to your liking, pour the content into the pot with the lentils and mix well and keep it warm.

==Notes, tips and variations==

* Perhaps at first you think &quot;how can fit vinegar in this stew&quot; you will be surprised how good it fits, so don't be shy with it, or better place it on your table so everybody can do it as they like..
* Before eating, pick out the bay (laurel) leaves.
* About the warming up etc. it's like with every stew, it is also great on the other day ;)

How do you like it?
I would be happy to have feedback in the discussion panel.
Also things to do better etc.

''Greetings from Suabia!''

A '''tequeño''' is prepared with a bread dough with white cheese (queso blanco) in the middle. It is formed into a bread stick and then fried. It is one of the most popular snack foods in parties, especially weddings. It is said that a party is not a true Venezuelan party without tequeños.

The name &quot;tequeños&quot; comes from the town of Los Teques, capital of the state of Miranda where it is believed this food originated from. The oldest known references to it come from the first decade of the 19th century. At that time the richest families of Caracas would spend long vacation periods in Los Teques and it is believed that they started preparing them with the left over dough of another Venezuelan food &quot;pastelitos&quot;.

==Ingredients==

*1 kg [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1 kg [[Cookbook:Cheese|white soft cheese]]

==Procedure==

*Mix the flour, oil, egg, salt and sugar in a bowl.
*While kneading, add a tablespoon or two of water.
*Keep kneading until it does not stick to your hands.
*Let the dough rest for 1-2 hours .
*While the dough is resting, cut the cheese into finger-like strips, roughly 1 cm x 1 cm x 7 cm (½&quot; by ½&quot; by 3&quot;).
*After the dough has rested, shape it into palm sized balls.
*Roll them out until they are ½ cm (¼-0.125 inch) thick.
*Cut the rolled-out dough into long strips that are 1½ cm (¾&quot;) wide.
*Wrap the cheese strips with the dough strips.
*Make sure you cover all the cheese and seal it inside the dough, because otherwise the cheese will leak out of the dough when you fry them.
*After you have wrapped the cheese in dough, dust the raw &quot;tequeños&quot; with flour and deep fry them in hot oil, until a golden tone is obtained.

Tequeños are best served with [[Cookbook:Guasacaca|guasacaca]], in either its mild (green) or spicy (red) formats.

'''Fried chicken''' is a Southern main meal in the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|USA]], served often at &quot;Sunday dinner&quot; (&quot;dinner&quot; being the midday meal for many Southerners) or church &quot;suppers&quot; (&quot;supper&quot; being the term for the evening meal). Recipes are legion; every family has one handed down. Here's one:

==To make the Chicken==

===Ingredients===

*one whole [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]]
*2 cups [[Cookbook:Buttermilk|buttermilk]]
*1 tsp [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard powder]]
*1 tsp [[Cookbook:Cayenne pepper|cayenne powder]]
*2 tsp cracked [[Cookbook:Pepper|black peppercorns]]
*1 tsp [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]]
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]]
*1 tsp [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]]
*[[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] seasoned with herbs and spices (see procedure)

The spice mix isn't fixed. You can use more or less as desired.

===Procedure===

# Cut up a chicken into 8-10 pieces.
# Mix other ingredients except seasoned flour together, and [[Cookbook:Marinating|marinate]] the chicken pieces for four hours in the mixture.
# Take each chicken piece out of the marinade and allow it to drip dry a few seconds. Then dredge it in seasoned flour. (Seasonings could include pepper, cayenne, salt, ground coriander, cinnamon, thyme, oregano). An easy way to dredge: put flour and seasonings in a small plastic bag, drop the piece in, and shake.
# Let the pieces rest (separately; do not stack) for about 10 minutes. Then dredge them again. The first dredging absorbs the buttermilk marinade. The second dredging gives a seasoned flour outer coat.
# Fry pieces in a deep, wide pan. Use an oil with a high smoke-point (peanut oil is good, but corn oil is OK too). When oil is smoking hot, drop pieces into the pan, and be careful to not overcrowd (pieces should not touch; fry in two batches). After three or four minutes, turn the chicken, and reduce the heat. Let the chicken fry for 20-25 minutes, turning the pieces every few minutes. When the chicken is a deep golden-brown, and the juices run clear, it's done. The chicken will continue to cook after being removed from the pan, so err on the side of &quot;just about done&quot;.
# Drain the chicken on absorbent paper or cloth. If you are not serving the chicken immediately, place it in a lightly-warmed oven, uncovered, separately (not stacked).

==To make the gravy==

===Ingredients===

* [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]
* 1 small [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]] (or [[Cookbook:Green onion|shallots]]) chopped
* [[Cookbook:Garlic|clove of garlic]]
* 3-4 tbsp [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 3 cups [[Cookbook:Stock|chicken stock/bouillon]] (or 2 cups stock and 1 cup [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]])
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]

===Procedure===

# Pour off the accumulated oil from the pan, though reserving 3-4 tablespoons and all the flour and chicken residue. Keeping the pan on medium flame, toss in one small chopped onion and a clove of garlic. [[Cookbook:Sautéing|Sauté]] for a few minutes. Whisk in 3-4 tablespoons of flour, and keep stirring until the mixture becomes light to medium brown. Do not burn.
# Whisk in 3 cups of chicken stock or bouillon (or 2 cups stock and 1 cup cream). Simmer on low flame, covered, for 15 minutes. Salt and pepper to taste.
# Serve chicken with [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]], and with some green vegetable. Spoon gravy over rice and chicken.

'''Tod Mun''' (Thai fish cakes) can be found sold on the streets of Thailand and they are a popular snack. At home they are perfect for an appetizer. There are many different recipes; the most common variant uses both fish and shrimp. This is the basic fish recipe.

==Ingredients==
*1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (120 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) vegetable oil (for frying)
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] (15 mL) sugar
*1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] (7.5 mL) salt
*120 [[Cookbook:gram|grams]] green beans
*360 [[Cookbook:gram|grams]] ground fish or fish paste (''pla kuud)''
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] (15 mL) red curry paste
*1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
*3 [[Cookbook:Kaffir Lime Leaf|Kaffir lime leaves]]

== Procedure ==
# Stack the lime leaves and roll them together into a tube shape. Slice them into thin strips.
# Slice the green beans into small (½ inch) pieces.
# Mince the fish.
# Mix all the ingredients except the green beans and lime leaves in a bowl. 
# Stir until the mixture is smooth.
# Add the green beans and lime leaves to the mixture and stir again.
# Add the oil to a frying pan and heat to a medium temperature.
# Drop a tablespoon of the mixture into the pan and flatten slightly. When the bottom is cooked, turn over.
# When cooked on both sides, place on a paper towel to drain any extra oil. Continue with the rest of the mixture.

==Notes==

* If fresh Kaffir lime leaves are not available, do not substitute dried leaves as this will not work, and it is better to leave them out altogether.
* You may substitute the fish with chicken.

'''Irish stew''' is a traditional [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Ireland|Irish]] dish made from [[Cookbook:Lamb|lamb]] or [[Cookbook:Mutton|mutton]] as well as [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]]es, [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]s and [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]].  It originated in Ireland but appears in cookbooks all over Europe, including in [[w:Escoffier|Escoffier]]'s Guide Culinaire.

Irish stew is a filling, flavourful dish made with the most readily-available ingredients. The Irish raised primarily sheep and root crops for subsistence. The sheep provided wool for warm clothing, milk for drinking and making cheese, and eventually food. Potatoes were the main food crop, prior to the potato famine. (Sometimes the potatoes are boiled separately, and added before serving, as they tend to break down faster than other ingredients.)

Irish stew, or &quot;stobhach gaelach&quot; as it is called in Irish, is traditionally made of lamb or mutton (mutton is from less tender sheep over two years of age), potatoes, onions, and parsley. Sometimes, lamb or mutton neckbones, shanks, and other trimmings were the only basis for the stock. Yet these would-be discards still held enough flavor after a long simmering process to do justice to a hearty bowl of stew. The root vegetables added further flavor and thickening power, as well as filling sustenance. Some cooks added [[Cookbook:Turnip|turnips]] or [[Cookbook:Parsnip|parsnips]], [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]], and [[Cookbook:Barley|barley]] when available.

Although traditionally made with lamb or mutton, Irish stew was basically a cheap meal which was thrown together with left-overs and filled out with potatoes. More recently, Irish stew has been made with cheap [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]].

When the Irish people began immigrating to the United States, they naturally brought along their food traditions. The stew evolved and adapted to include the local offerings. Sheep were not as plentiful, so other types of meat were often substituted. The recipe has evolved to often include Guinness stout and [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]]. Some variations have exalted this original peasant dish to near gourmet status.

== Ingredients ==
* 2½ lb (1.1kg) boned [[Cookbook:Mutton|mutton]]
* 4 large [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]
* 2 large [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]]
* 3 or 4 medium [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]]
* sprig of [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]]
* 2 cups (480ml) [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]

==Procedure==

# Cut the meat into good size chunks. Peel the vegetables and slice thickly. Chop the parsley. 
# Choose a pot with a well-fitting lid and put in the ingredients in layers, starting and finishing with potatoes. Pour in the water and season to taste. 
# Cover and put on a very low heat for about 2½ hours until the meat is tender and the potatoes have thickened the liquid. The dish may also be made with [[Cookbook:Lamb|lamb]], in which case it requires only 1½ hours cooking time.

'''Dandelions''' make a great free meal. Not only are they high in nutrition and very good for you, they also taste great!

== Where do I take them from? ==
Find some flowers in your yard or field that are not right by the road and collecting pollution from traffic. Larger varieties of dandelions and older, tougher leaves may be cooked like any greens.  They are probably closest in character to mustard greens, though bitter. Young plants are a little less bitter; the very young ones make an excellent though slightly bitter salad. 

With a knife, cut the whole plant at the top of the root so that it comes out of the ground intact. You should snap off the yellow flowers that have already opened up but be sure to leave any unopened buds - these are the tastiest part!

== Remove the bitterness ==
Once you have given your pickings a good washing to get off all the dirt, stick them in a pot with enough water to just cover and boil until they are nice and soft. When the water turns yellow, replace it with fresh water and re-boil. This will remove the bitterness. When they are done they will have the consistency of cooked spinach. If you have very young plants you may decide to skip this step.

== Recipes ==
* Strain and dress with [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], a squeeze of [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]], or [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]. Optionally, add little pieces of fried [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]].
* Dandelion salad is often accompanied with [[Cookbook:Hard Boiled Egg|hard boiled eggs]].
* Lightly [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sauté]] (or [[Cookbook:Roasting|roast]]) a clove of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], half an [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]] and a quarter teaspoon of [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|red pepper flakes]] in a tablespoon and a half of [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]. Add a quart of damp greens to the sautéed vegetables, cover and steam over low heat for about thirty minutes.  Season to taste and serve.

==Procedure==

# Peel the tomatos. Optionally remove the seeds.
# Blend the tomatos, 1 tbsp olive oil and salt to taste in an appropriate vessel with an immersion blender.
# Cut the French bread loaf in appropriate sized portions and open those in halves. Optionally toast them very lightly also to increase tenderness.

[[Image:Indian filter coffee in Dabarah.jpg|right|thumb|South Indian filter coffee served in a traditional tumbler and dabarah / davarah]]

'''Madras filter coffee''' requires the use of specific fresh-roasted [[Cookbook:Coffee|coffee beans]] and [[Cookbook:Chicory|chicory roots]] which are not always available outside [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]]. An alternative is to use a brand of Indian instant coffee that has chicory in it, and is available in some Indian stores and supermarkets. BRU instant coffee has 30% chicory added and in general has a near enough taste to authentic Madras filter coffee.

Indian coffee is generally not black coffee and is made using milk instead of water.

==Procedure==
To make one cup of coffee:
# Heat a small quantity (¼) cup of water until it boils.
# Put ½ to 2 teaspoon (depending on how strong you want to have the coffee) of BRU instant coffee in it.
# Stir the solution and ensure that there are no lumps of coffee.
# Boil ¾ cup of milk and bring to boil.
# Add the coffee mixture to the milk and add sugar as per your preference.
# While the coffee is still boiling hot, pour it into a mug or, preferably, a stainless steel tumbler. While pouring the coffee, slowly raise the saucepan until the coffee falls into the mug/tumbler from a height of about 1 to 1½ ft. This will cause the coffee to froth (like [[Cookbook:espresso|espresso]]).
# You can dip a teaspoon in the coffee and lightly spread a few drops of it over the froth in the mug.
# Serve piping hot.

NOTE: filter coffee in india is actually made in a closed steel container called a coffee filter .coffee percolates into hot water.

[[Image:SaucepanFudgeCrackleCookies.jpg|right|thumb|256px|Saucepan Fudge Crackle Cookies and milk]]
These are true [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]] cookies. They are brownie-like or cake-like. They tend to have a dome-like surface that stands 1/2-inch to 3/4-inch tall, and have a diameter of 2.5 to 5 inches. The surface is cracked.

==Ingredients==

* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* 1/4 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1/4 cup [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
* 3 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounces]] unsweetened [[Cookbook:Baking Chocolate|baking chocolate]]
* 1 cup granulated [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] extract
* 1/2 cup coarsely chopped [[Cookbook:Nut|nuts]] (for example, 1/2-inch [[Cookbook:Walnut|walnut]] pieces)
* additional sugar for coating

==Procedure==
#Mix the flour, baking powder, and salt.
#In a 3-[[Cookbook:Quart|quart]] [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]] on low heat, melt together the margarine and chocolate.
#Remove the chocolate mixture from the heat.
#Into the chocolate mixture, mix the eggs, sugar, vanilla, and nuts.
#Mix the flour mixture into the chocolate mixture.
#Cover and refrigerate until firm. Overnight would be good.
#Make 1.5-inch balls of the mixture. As you make them, roll them in coarse sugar and place them onto a cool, ungreased, insulated cookie sheet. Be sure to allow room for expansion.
#Bake at [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|300°F]] for 20 minutes.
#Immediately remove the cookies from the cookie sheet. If you delay, the cookies will very strongly adhere to the cookie sheet.

==Variation==
The original used [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], which contaminates the taste of the chocolate. The insulated cookie sheet is also a recent modification, added to avoid burning parts of the cookie while failing to fully cook other parts. [[Cookbook:Hazelnut|Hazelnuts]] and [[Cookbook:Macadamia Nut|macadamia nuts]] go well in this recipe.

* 1 [[Cookbook:Pound|pound]] [[Cookbook:Peanut|peanuts]]
* 1 pound [[Cookbook:Pecan|pecans]]
* 1 can [[Cookbook:Cashew|cashews]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste

===Sauce:===

* 3 sticks [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
* Heaping ½ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon grease]]
* 1¾ to 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic salt]]
* 2 tablespoons plus dash [[Cookbook:Worcestershire Sauce|Worcestershire sauce]]
* Heaping ½ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] Accent

This is a classically inspired steak recipe, with influences from both [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|American]] and [[Cookbook:European cuisines|European cuisine]].

==Ingredients==

* Two 8 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] [[Cookbook:Beef|sirloin steaks]]
* [[Cookbook:Montreal Steak Spice|Montreal steak spice]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Wine|Cabernet Sauvignon]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Vinegar|balsamic vinegar]]
* 8-10 cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* ⅓ large white [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* 4 cloves [[Cookbook:Shallot|shallots]]
* 2 tbsp extra virgin [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]

==Procedure==
# Dice the onion, shallots, and garlic. Set these aside. 
# Pre-heat a medium-sized [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]] to low-medium heat, and pre-heat the barbecue to high.
# Throw the onions in the pan, and [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sauté]] until light yellow. 
# Place the shallots and garlic in as well, and sauté for a few minutes more. Make sure all ingredients are lightly crisped.
# Pour in about ⅓ of the wine and ⅓ of the vinegar. Let this boil off at lower heat for about 5-10 minutes.
# Place the steaks on the [[Cookbook:Barbecue|barbecue]], seasoning with the Montreal steak spice.
# Add the rest of the wine and vinegar, grinding some fresh pepper on top. Boil off until you no longer smell the alcohol coming from the steaming wine.
# Flip the steaks. You want them to be soft on the inside (cooked rare) yet quite charred on the outside, to get that charcoal flavor.
# Once the sauce has gone down to about ⅓ of its original volume, take off heat.
# Remove steaks from grill, and take inside.

Place the steaks on your plates, cover with the reduction, and serve!

You may wish to serve this flavorful dish with a side that would complement its strong flavors, such as [[Cookbook:Asparagus|asparagus]], new [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], or roasted [[Cookbook:Brussels Sprout|Brussels sprouts]].

Serves two people.

This is a nice, light, cooling salad or side dish to have during the hottest summer months. That's when my mother would make it.

== Ingredients ==
* 2 [[Cookbook:Cucumber|cucumber]]s
* 1 white [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]]s (480 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) distilled white [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]]s (10 mL) [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]]
* 1 teaspoon (5 mL) [[Cookbook:sugar|sugar]]
* 1 teaspoon (5 mL) [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
* These are estimates and you should mix the marinade ingredients to taste

== Procedure ==

# Mix vinegar, oil, salt and sugar for the marinade.
# Trim the ends from the cucumbers, peel them and slice them.
# Peel the onion and slice it as thinly as possible.
# Pour the marinade over the cucumbers and onions and mix well.
# Let it sit in a cool place or refrigerate for at least two hours, stirring occasionally.

Serve in a bowl, marinade and all, using salad tongs or a slotted spoon to dish out servings.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
* Any light salad oil may be used. Avoid olive oil as it congeals when refrigerated.
* The cucumber to onion ratio should be from 2:1 to 2.5:1.
* There should be just a hint of oil in the marinade and just enough sugar to take the edge off of the vinegar's tartness.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{cookwork|needs baking temp}}
{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Dessert|Dessert]] | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|UK Cuisine]]

These instructions will make a sticky and indulgent lemon meringue pie. If you want the normal gel-like centre, use the [[Cookbook:Lemon Meringue Pie|other recipe]] instead. 

==Ingredients==
Serves 4.

*8 [[Cookbook:Digestive Biscuit|digestive biscuits]] (plain/tea biscuits)
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|imperial tbsp]] (36 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]], 2.4 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|US tbsp.]]) [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] 
*1 tin [[Cookbook:Condensed milk|sweetened condensed milk]]
*1-2 [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemons]]
*3 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]] (1 yolk, 3 whites)
*6 imperial tbsp (108 mL, 7.2 US tbsp.) [[Cookbook:Superfine Sugar|caster sugar]]

==Procedure==

# Find a 10 inch (25cm) diameter pie dish about 1 inch deep (2.5cm). There are 3 layers to make.
# Make the bottom layer by pounding the digestive biscuits into crumbs with the end of a [[Cookbook:Rolling Pin|rolling pin]]. Add sufficient melted butter to make the mixture cohere, mix well, then smooth it into the bottom of the pie dish. Press down firmly with the tip of a spoon to make the base. 
# Make the filling. Take a tin of sweetened condensed milk, and add the yolk of one egg. Stir gently, and add the lemon. Add the lemon to taste: more will be better, but be careful not to add too much or it will spoil the texture. Do not stir too much. Pour this into the pie dish, covering the biscuit layer.
# Make the top. Whisk all 3 egg whites, then add the caster sugar, then whisk some more. Spoon the meringue mix into the pie dish, sealing around the edges. 
# Cook the result in a moderately cool oven for about 45 minutes until the meringue is a light golden brown. The aim is to cook the meringue and partly cook the centre (unlike, say, [[Cookbook:Baked Alaska|baked Alaska]], where only the top of the meringue is flash-cooked). Remove from the oven, allow to cool, and place in the refrigerator for 2 hours to set. Enjoy.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*There are 2 types of lemon meringue pie. The more common version has a lemon &quot;gel&quot; in the centre (which is often a luminous yellow colour), and a hard pastry base.  The version above is much stickier. 
*In an earlier version, the centre used all 3 egg yolks. It isn't necessary, and it is more healthful to omit 2 of them. 

==Warnings==
*One pie may not be enough...
*The acidity of the lemon acts on the protein in the egg yolk to thicken the filling. Therefore, the egg yolk must be added and mixed in ''before'' the lemon; otherwise, the egg-yolk will go &quot;stringy&quot; when it hits the acidic mixture. 
*If there are children present, it is practically impossible to keep them from licking the contents of the condensed milk tin! Be careful of the edges.

'''Irish Potato bread''', also known as '''fadge''', '''slims''', '''potato cake''' or '''potato farls''', is a form of unleavened [[Cookbook:bread|bread]] in which [[Cookbook:potato|potato]] replaces a major portion of the regular wheat flour. It is usually cooked by baking it on a hot griddle or pan.  It can be served with an [[Cookbook:Irish breakfast|Irish breakfast]] and in [[Cookbook:Northern Irish cuisine|Northern Ireland]], where it is colloquially known as 'Tatie Bread', it can form part of the [[Cookbook:Ulster fry|Ulster fry]]. In [[Cookbook:Scottish cuisine|Scotland]] potato bread is colloquially known as ''Totty Scone'' or ''[[Cookbook:Tattie Scone|Tattie Scone]]''.

This bread started out in the late nineteenth century as a means of making use of mashed potato leftovers, the potato being a staple part of the Irish diet.

== Ingredients ==
*225 g (8 oz) warm cooked [[Cookbook:potato|potato]], mashed
*1/2 tsp [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
*25 g (1 oz) [[Cookbook:butter|butter]], melted
*50 g (2 oz) plain [[Cookbook:flour|flour]]

==Procedure==
#Add salt and butter, then work in enough flour to make a pliable dough. Divide the dough in two and roll out on a floured surface to form two circles 22 cm (9 in) in diameter and 5 mm (1/4 in) in thickness. 
#Cut each circle into quarters and [[Cookbook:bake|bake]] on a hot griddle or pan for about 5 minutes or until browned on both sides. 

(Recipe from ''Ireland's Eye'')

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Some people like to grease the baking surface, while others prefer a light dusting of flour for a drier effect. 
*Commercial recipes tend to use potato flour/flakes instead of mashed potato and have little to no fat.  They are traditionally sold as thin rectangular slices in packs of four.
*Potato bread is usually sold in its original form, but there are some rare variations:
*#'''[[Cookbook:Pratie Oaten|Pratie Oaten]]''', with fine [[Cookbook:oatmeal|oatmeal]] instead of flour in the recipe above for more texture. 
*#'''[[Cookbook:Apple Potato bread|Apple Potato bread]]''', a specialty of Armagh, which is famous for growing [[Cookbook:apple|apple]]s.  Potato bread wrapped, [[Cookbook:pasty|pasty]]-like, around a sweet filling of apples.

== How to eat potato bread ==
Popular ways to eat potato bread:
*Fried as part of the traditional fried breakfast, the Ulster Fry, which includes other breads that have been fried, such as [[Cookbook:Irish Soda Bread|Irish Soda Bread]].
*[[Cookbook:Toasted|Toasted]] and smothered with butter, and perhaps also cheese.
*With [[Cookbook:baked beans|baked beans]] or [[Cookbook:egg|egg]]s as a children's meal.

* 1 store-bought [[Cookbook:Pie Crust|pie crust]]

===Pie Filling===
*1 lb (500g) [[Cookbook:Apple|apples]], sliced
*2 tbsp [[Cookbook:lemon juice|lemon juice]]
*1 oz salted [[Cookbook:butter|butter]]

*[[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]]

===Pie Topping===
*1 oz (28g) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*[[Cookbook:cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*[[Cookbook:sugar|sugar]]

==Procedure==
===Pie Crust===
#Rub flour, margarine, lard, and salt together until the mixture has the consistency of fine breadcrumbs.
#Add 2 tablespoons water to make a soft but firm dough.
#Roll pastry on floured surface to the size you want your pie. Make two crusts.
#Place one crust in pie pan.

===Everything Else===
*Do not precook apples, as this will deprive the pie of a substantial amount of flavor and turns the apples into goop!

#Add lemon juice to apples.
#Mix apples by hand with 1/2 cup sugar and a few dashes of cinnamon. 
#Transfer segments, minus their acquired juices, to pie pan. (Omitting the expressed juice will help prevent the pie from boiling over in the oven.) 
#Mix the rest of the sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, flour, and cornstarch in a separate bowl.
#Pour this over the apples in pie pan.
#Dot with butter.
#Cover with the other crust.
#Firm down edges with fork or finger.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
{{wikipedia|apple pie}}
*Use a variety of apples to get more complex flavors and textures.
*Use 2-3 Granny Smith apples, in combination with the other apples.
*Replace the lard with shortening for a vegan dessert.

==Warnings==
*Filling will be very hot immediately after the pie is taken from the oven.

'''Sofrito''' is a combination of ingredients used to give a distinctive flavor to many [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] dishes. It is mostly used when cooking legumes, rice dishes, soups and stews. The two main ingredients that give sofrito its characteristic flavor are: ''recao'' (also known as culantro) and ''ají dulce''. Ají dulce may be substituted for bell peppers. Sofrito is also traditionally made with salted [[Cookbook:pork|pork]], [[Cookbook:Ham|cured ham]], and [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]]. When pork is used the sofrito is cooked before storing.

The following recipe has no pork and therefore it is not cooked before storing. This allows for a quicker preparation and also makes it [[Cookbook:Vegetarian cuisine|vegetarian ]] friendly. 

==Sofrito==
(Yield: 1 quart)

*3 cups (4 bunches) fresh [[Cookbook:Culantro|recao]] leaves (culantro), chopped
*3 cups (2 bunches) fresh [[Cookbook:cilantro|cilantro]], chopped
*½ cup of dried [[Cookbook:oregano|oregano]] 
*2 cloves of [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic ]] 
*2 large [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], chopped

'''Cha Shao''' is a kind of spiced Cantonese honey roast [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]]. It is often also called by the Cantonese '''Char Siu''' or '''Char Siew'''. Sometimes (usually in America) it is called '''Chinese BBQ Pork'''. It is very popular, and can be eaten by itself (usually cold), or used as an ingredient for other dishes such as Cha Shao Bao (steamed pork buns), or in noodles or rice.

The pork used should be quite fatty in order to keep the meat moist during cooking. Pork shoulder is a good choice. The meat is traditionally hung to cook, as this allows it to cook from all sides in the very hot oven. It can be laid on a rack, but if possible hang from metal S-hooks on a high rack, which are easily and cheaply available from hardware stores.

[[Cookbook:Sherry|Sherry]] can be used instead of [[Cookbook:Shaoxing wine|Shaoxing wine]] (also called Shao Hsing wine), but it does not provide quite the same flavour.

Since this dish requires a reasonably large amount of time and preparation, even while cooking (frequent basting is needed), it is easiest to make it in large batches. The recipe here makes 1kg, which is enough for several different dishes. It can be kept in the fridge for several days or frozen until required.

==Ingredients==

* 1 kg [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] shoulder.
* 2 tbsp. dark [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]
* 2 tbsp. light soy sauce
* 2 tbsp. [[Cookbook:Oyster Sauce|oyster sauce]]
* 2 tbsp. Shaoxing [[Cookbook:Rice Wine|rice wine]]
* 2 tbsp. clear [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]]
* 4 tbsp. [[Cookbook:Hoisin Sauce|hoisin sauce]]
* ½ tsp. [[Cookbook:Five Spice Powder|five spice]]

==Procedure==

#Slice the meat into strips about 1 inch wide by 6 inches long. A long thin strip like this will keep its shape better when hanging.
#pierce the pork all over thoroughly with a fork. This make the pork more tender and allows the marinade to penetrate the meat to give flavour all the way through.
#Mix all other ingredients together.
#Place pork strips in a tray and cover with marinade. Ensure strips are covered completely in marinade.
#Cover tightly with cling film and place in the refrigerator for several hours. Overnight or for 24 hours is preferable.
#Preheat the oven to 230°C and place a pan in the bottom to catch drippings. Line this pan with aluminium foil to make cleaning easier.
#Hang the meat on hooks in the oven or lay them on a rack. Depending on the method and the size of your oven, it may be easiest to do this in two or three batches, rather than all at once.
#Roast for 20 minutes, until pork is cooked all the way through. Baste at least twice to build up a good layer of marinade on the outside of the meat. The pork should turn a golden-red colour as it cooks.
#Allow to cool while still hanging, or lay on wire rack to cool. Avoid laying on top of other meat or on a flat surface until cooled.
#Cover and refrigerate until needed.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
* Serve cold, or use diced in other dishes.
* Add 1 tbsp. of toasted sesame oil for a nuttier flavour
* Add red food colouring to the marinade to give the traditional deep red hue. This used to be due to the preservative used for the pork. Also, in China, the red colour generally symbolises good fortune. However, due to the strong colour of the marinade described above, a significant quantity of food colouring will be needed.

This dish goes very well with ginger and onion.

==Warnings==
* Use care in handling the raw pork. Wash hands and utensils that come into contact with raw pork. Don't allow raw pork or its juices to come into contact with other foods, unless they are to be cooked afterwards.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Bread Recipes|Bread recipes]]

A '''baozi''', also known as '''bao''' or '''bau''', is a type of steamed, filled bun or
[[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]-like item in Chinese cuisine. In its bun-like aspect it is very similar to the traditional Chinese [[Cookbook:Mantou|mantou]]. It can be filled with meat or vegetarian fillings, or left plain and used as an alternative to [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] or [[Cookbook:Noodles|noodles]]. It can be eaten at any meal in Chinese culture, and is often eaten for breakfast.

This recipe is just for the dough. Links to commonly made baozi fillings are given below.

==Ingredients==
===Steamed buns===
*1½ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] warm water (around body temperature - 100°F or 38°C)
*3 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]]. active dry [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]] (or 1 packet)
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbsp]]. granulated white [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*4 cups white bread [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]], plus extra for flouring hands, surfaces, etc.
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]. Must be double-acting (i.e. has a raising agent that works at high temperature).
*½ tsp. salt, if desired.
*a little bit of sesame oil for step 7

==Procedure==
===Making the Dough===
#Stir yeast and 1 tablespoon of sugar into 1 cup of the warm water. Let stand for 15 minutes. Skip this step if your yeast does not need proofing (it will say so on the packet)
#Sift the flour and sugar together.
#If you pre-mixed the yeast, add to the flour and the rest of the sugar in a mixing bowl.
#If you didn't pre-mix the yeast, mix flour, salt if desired, and the sugar, then mix in yeast in a mixing bowl. Add 1 cup of the water in a steady stream, mixing constantly.
#Mix together. The dough will begin to form a ragged clump. If the dough does not stick together, add a small amount more water.
#Knead dough for 5-10 minutes. The dough will stiffen, and should spring back slowly when indented with a finger. The surface should be smooth and slightly shiny.
#Coat the bottom of a large bowl with the sesame oil to give a thin film, and place the dough in the bowl. Roll over so it is coated with the oil.
#Allow dough to rise and double in volume in a warm place for 1-1½ hours, or in a cool place like a fridge for 2-3 hours. A slow rise in a cool place will produce a finer texture.
#Punch dough down. If you wish at this point, you can allow it to rise and double again, in a warm or cool place, and punch down again. A double rise also results in a finer, more tender texture.
#Form into a large pancake shape.
#Sprinkle the baking powder evenly across the dough, and knead again, until the same consistency as before it rose. Water from the yeast's respiration may have made the dough softer, so add a bit more flour if needed.
#Divide the dough into two long rolls, and cut each into 6 pieces.
#Roll each piece of dough into a ball. If you are making plain baozi, go straight to Step 20 now. If making filled baozi, then flatten each ball into a 6-inch disc.
#Shape the disc so that it is significantly thicker in the centre than at the edges. 
#Position one hand as if you were holding a normal drinking glass, and place a disc of dough over the top.
#Using two fingers, push the centre of the disc down by about 1 inch. 
#Place 1 dessert spoon of filling into the well you just made in the dough. 
#Still holding your hand in position, use your other hand to fold the edges of the dough together, in a sort of pleated fashion.
#Pinch edges together and twist (so that you twist a small portion at the top right off) to close the baozi.
#Place each baozi on a square of parchment paper, 3 inches to a side.
#Allow to rise in warm place 1 hour. The dough should end up springy to the touch.

===Cooking===
#Place buns in a steamer. Try to position so they do not touch one another. It will almost certainly require several batches to steam all the buns, unless you have lots of steamers, or a very big one. You can put them seam up (opening flower effect) or seam down (smooth, round top).
#Steam buns over gently boiling water for 20 minutes.
#After this time, remove the pan and steamer from heat, but '''don't''' remove the steamer from the pan, or lift the lid of the steamer. By allowing the steam to subside gradually like this, you prevent the dough from collapsing on contact with the cold air.
#After a few minutes, carefully lift the lid and remove the bun gently from the steamer.
#When cool enough to handle, remove parchment paper from bottom of buns.
#Serve warm.

==Variations and Tips==
*Use bleached flour for a whiter bread
*The ideal sweetness of the baozi is subjective - in China, they generally get sweeter the further south you go. This recipe is fairly sweet, but can be modified either way.
*Depending on taste, you can add salt to the dough - ½ tsp. should be sufficient. Remember not to allow concentrated salt to come into contact with the yeast, as it will kill it. Mix the salt with the flour, then add the yeast.
*Ensure the place used for rising is draught-free. Draughts prevent the dough from rising as much, resulting in a flatter bread.
*Use flour to keep the dough from sticking to you hands, not oil. This keeps the dough from getting too wet. It is cooked in a damp environment, so you don't want wet dough.
*Try to keep the dough from drying out and forming a crust when not being worked with. Rise in a covered container (using clingfilm), and cover with a towel when not immediately handling the dough.
*Add a couple of tablespoons of vinegar to the steaming water to bleach the buns slightly. The vinegar does not significantly affect the taste of the buns.
*Try to use a bamboo steamer. Although a metal one will suffice, it doesn't impart a subtle flavour to the buns like bamboo, and it won't prevent water from forming on flat surfaces and making soggy patches.

==Warnings==
*Keep leftovers refrigerated.
*To reheat, steam for 10-15 minutes or heat in microwave for 30-45 seconds. Reheating by steaming gives better results.

==Common Baozi Fillings==

*[[Cookbook:Cha Shao Bao|Cha Shao Bao]] - Chinese honey roast pork ('''cha shao''', '''char siu''' or sometimes &quot;Chinese BBQ&quot;)
*[[Cookbook:Red Bean Paste|Red Bean Paste]] - A sweet paste made of [[Cookbook:Azuki Bean|adzuki beans]] and sugar

'''Brigadeiro''' is a simple Brazillian chocolate fudge candy created in the 1920s.  It is named after Brazilian airman Brigadeiro Eduardo Gomes. 

For further information see [[w:Brigadeiro|Wikipedia's entry on Brigadeiro]].

== Ingredients ==

* 1 can of [[Cookbook:Condensed milk|condensed milk]] (395g)
* 3 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]]s of [[Cookbook:Cocoa powder|cocoa powder]]
* 1 packet of [[Cookbook:Chocolate sprinkle|chocolate sprinkle]]s
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] of [[Cookbook:butter|butter]]

== Procedure ==

# In a heavy [[Cookbook:saucepan|saucepan]], mix the milk, cocoa and butter. Stir to dissolve the chocolate.
# Put over low heat and stir constantly with a wooden spoon.
# Continue stirring until you are able to see the bottom of the pot when you tilt the pan - the mixture should slide quickly. This should take 10-12 minutes. 
# Transfer to a greased plate. 
# Allow to cool. 
# Butter your hands and roll the mixture into small balls (around 2cm in diameter) and roll them over the chocolate sprinkles.

== Variations ==

You can substitute the cocoa powder for 100g of baking chocolate. If you want a lighter candy use powdered chocolate (such as Nestlé Quick™). You can also put [[Cookbook:raisin|raisin]]s or [[Cookbook:Nut|nut]]s in the center of the candy. You can decorate with powdered [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] instead, or cocoa powder.

''This is a wonderful dish that is absurdly easy to produce and makes you look like a professional Chef. It is a good accompaniment for Roast Lamb or Roast Chicken, but is as delicious served on its own with a green salad''

==Ingredients==

* 5 medium sized waxy [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], peeled or not peeled,
* 4 cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] ([[Cookbook:Smoking|smoked]] garlic is good for this dish if you can get hold of it)
* ½ pint of reduced fat [[Cookbook:Crème Fraîche|crème fraîche]] or [[Cookbook:Cream|single cream]] or, if health conscious, a mixture of semi-skimmed milk and Creme Fraiche
* 3 oz of good quality [[Cookbook:Gruyère Cheese|Gruyère]] or [[Cookbook:Emmental Cheese|Emmentaler cheese]], freshly [[Cookbook:Grater|grated]]
* a [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]

I recently used some Swiss Appenzeller cheese for this and it was the absolute best !!

==Procedure==

# Slice the potatoes very thinly (about ⅛&quot; thick) if possible using a Mandolin to achieve evenness, and place them in some fresh water.
# Twirl them around with your hand a little as this gets rid of the starch which tends to make the gratin a little unpleasant.
# Pour away the water and place the potatoes on a wooden surface and pat dry with some kitchen paper (or loo roll!) or a towel. This is more important than one thinks,  as otherwise the remaining water will mix with the cream/milk mixture causing curdling problems.
# Return the sliced potatoes to a bowl and add the cream/milk mixture and the garlic which you have either sliced or pressed through a garlic press. Add a generous pinch of sea salt and some pepper.
# You can also add a few fresh herbs ([[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]] is particularly good) but this is up to you. But I suggest don't go over the top.
# Peel the zest of the lemon and add it to the mixture.
# Mix well, so the cream gives a good coating to all the potatoes.  
#:''Some people tend to layer the potatoes in the heat proof bowl first and then pour the cream over. This, to my mind is a little unreliable as the cream does not diffuse through all the layers - and in any event the potatoes in a higgledy-piggledy pile in the bowl is much more attractive !''
# Pile the potatoes into a buttered, oven-proof dish. The size is if course difficult to gauge but the potatoes should not be layered more than about 4 thick.
# Grate a generous amount of Gruyere, Ementaler or Appenzeller cheese - please don't use Cheddar! - and spread over the mixture.
# Pop it all into the oven and leave until the top layer of cheese and potatoes are brown and the cream is bubbling and running down the side of the dish. This will take about 40 minutes
# For a final flourish before serving, grate a goodly amount of fresh nutmeg over the cheese.
# Serve with a salad as an delicious meal on its own, or as an accompaniment to light meat dishes. My view is that it tends not to go very well with fish.

A rather pleasant addition to this dish, and to make it even more delicious, fry up some pancetta, or bacon cubes and add them randomly as you build the dish !

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Southern cuisine|Southern cuisine]] 

==Ingredients==

* 80 [[Cookbook:Pound|pound]] [[Cookbook:Pork|pig]] (butchered and head removed)
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] 
* 40 pounds charcoal (for charcoal cooking option)
* Your favorite “Vinegar based [[Cookbook:Eastern North Carolina Barbecue Sauce|Eastern NC sauce]]”. 

==Procedure==

# Salt hams, ribs/midsection and shoulders liberally and place skin side up on either a gas or charcoal grill or a BBQ pit.
# Keep lid closed.
# Attain a heat of approximately [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|275-350°F]].
# Allow 1 hour per 10 pounds cooking time (gas or charcoal).
# 2 hours before being done, place pig with the skin side down.
# As soon as it is flipped, pour BBQ sauce on meat side.
# Close lid and allow skin to crisp.
# The pig will be done to perfection when the ham bone can be twisted freely.
# Lift lid and allow guests to pick/pull meat or the chef can remove meat and chop to his liking on a chopping block.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* Any higher heat or longer cooking time will result in the hams drying out.
* Heat source should be as indirect as possible if using a home made pit with there being less coals under the ribs/midsection and more around the perimeter. 
* Only lift the lid when required and not to let everyone take recreational looks at the pig.
* The more consistent you can maintain the heat source, the more evenly cooked and tender the pig will turn out. Remember “If you’re looking, you’re not cooking”.
* If picked, provide additional sauce for guests to add, if chopped add additional sauce and salt to chef’s liking.
* If picked this will feed 30-40 persons.
* If chopped this will yield 27 lbs of chopped BBQ.
* If you want tomato in your sauce, go to Lexington, NC! It's about 160 miles west of here. Have some 'cue before you leave, it'll take you about 3 hours to get there.

==Uses==

* Serve with [[Cookbook:Hush puppies|hush puppies]], [[Cookbook:Coleslaw|coleslaw]], [[Cookbook:Potato Salad|potato salad]], and [[Cookbook:Tea|sweet tea]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}}

If mincemeat in your experience has been a sorry disappointment, as most meatless mincemeats are, try this extraordinary recipe.

==Ingredients==
Spices:
:*2 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
:*1/2 tsp ground nutmeg
:*1.2 tsp ground cloves
:*1 Tbsp dried coffee (regular or decaffinated)
:*1 tsp salt 
:*1/2 tsp ground black pepper — added after cooking
*4 c sugar
*6-8 lbs. Baldwin apples
*1 whole lemon, remove only the seeds
*3 to 4 lbs. stew beef (neck, plate, etc.)
*2 c seedless black raisins

Liquids:
*1 c meat stock ( 1 1/2 c if not using brandy)
*1 1/2c sorghum (health food stores often have it, but molasses is easier to find in the supermarkets)
*1 c cider vinegar
*1/2 to 3/4 c brandy (optional, but don’t risk ruination with cheap brandy)


==Procedure==
1. Core apples; remove the seeds, but don’t peel.
:For heart-healthy mincemeat—with less flavor, alas,—remove the suet before cooking and skim off the fat that renders from the meat as it cooks. 

2. Cube meat and cover with salted water (salt optional). 
Simmer until tender—may take up to an hour. 

3. Remove meat and cook the stock down to the amount needed, or thicken slightly with (ugh!) cornstarch. 

4. Put meat through food mill (medium or coarse blade) or equivalent fineness in a food processor. For texture, I definitely prefer the grinder over the processor.

5. Cut lemon, remove seeds, and puree in a blender, rind and all, with some of the liquid ingredients, or process as finely as possible in a food processor.

6. Grind the apples, (or process using a coarse blade—but not too fine; ‘taint an applesauce.)

7. Mix into a large, heavy bottom, stew pot adding alternately apples, meat, raisins. 

8. Add the sugar, spices, the liquids and the lemon puree to the to the meat and apples using hot meat stock to rinse the last of the sorghum into the mixture. Stir thoroughly.

9. Cook slowly uncovered, stirring often to prevent burning until the mixture is pasteurized and enough of the liquids have evaporated to produce the texture and thickness you want in the finished pie. 

10. Let cool.

11. Stir in the ground pepper. 

12. Refrigerate, allowing the spices to mellow for several weeks ...or until you can’t hold out any longer.

==Further thoughts==
The apples are the most important ingredient, without doubt. Insipid apples make lousy mincemeat. A sharp, crisp, flavor-laden “pie” apple is best—we are very partial to the late maturing Baldwins—but Cortlands are also good. (Granny Smiths are plenty crisp and tart, but fall short in flavor, we think.) 

If you can’t find Baldwins or Cortlands, use the best pie apple you can find. And at their peak of flavor and texture in the autumn.

In our home, late October or early November is mincemeat time—so the mincemeat will be ready for the Holiday season. Ready? Yes, mincemeat at its best needs a few weeks to season in the refrigerator, say 6-8 weeks. The spices and flavors continue to mellow and will be just right for Thanksgiving and the coming holidays.

Will it keep? You bet! After all, the Pennsylvania Dutch ancestors had no freezers or refrigerators. Look at the ingredients: spices, sugar, vinegar—a cool storm cellar was good enough, ‘specially if you made a heap of it and put it in one of those many-gallon, stoneware crocks to age. 

Anyway, by spring when the weather turned warm, the mincemeat would be gone. Those hungry midwestern farmer ancestors who passed this recipe down the generations wouldn’t have left a scrap to spoil.

After aging, make up mincemeat pies and tarts to freeze un-baked; they will keep for several months. Pop them straight from the freezer into a hot oven for easy baking. 

What else to do with mincemeat? 
*Use as a hot topping for rich, vanilla ice cream; 
*Fancy, lettuce &amp; cottage cheese salad with mincemeat topping  
*Or simply as cold topping for plain cottage cheese or yogurt (at Sunday brunch, perhaps)?
*Classy peanut-butter/mincemeat sandwiches
*Oatmeal cookies made with mincemeat and raisins
*A spicy mincemeat chutney!  Simple and quick: Just sauté 1/2 tsp. red pepper in a Tbsp. of butter for five minutes.  Stir into a cup of mincemeat and there's your sweet and hot chutney.
*Tart filling 
*On toast
*Our own secret sin is cold pie with a glass of even colder milk... for breakfast, of course! 

Let your imagination go.  There’s really no limit with mincemeat, don't you know!

==Discussion==

In 1880 when Bess Storm's mother, Anna Frances Lynch, packed her little, brown-paper covered trunk for the trip from Boston to Iowa, she slipped in a small applewood box. In the box she had put a few pieces of jewelry and a few of her favorite recipes, including this one for mincemeat that had been in her family for as long as anyone could remember. 

Anna said that her grandmother, a devout temperance worker, took out the brandy and substituted vinegar and coffee, a combination that gives this recipe a distinct taste of its own.

This recipe has been a favorite family tradition for well over 100 years. If there exists a better mincemeat, we have yet to find it. What makes it special? Maybe the brandy. Maybe the coffee. (Recent generations have substituted dried coffee to hold down the excess liquid and shorten cooking time.)

[[Image:Kibbeh.jpg|right|thumb|Kibbeh]]

==Ingredients==
* Half kilo (500 [[Cookbook:Gram|g]]) of thin [[Cookbook:Bulgur|Bulgur]]
* Half kilo of thick Bulgur
* 2-2.5 glasses of [[Cookbook:Semolina|semolina]]
* [[Cookbook:Water|water]] as needed

===For the filling===
* 1 [[Cookbook:kg|kg]] of [[Cookbook:Mincing|minced]] [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]]
* 6-7 cut fried [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]] (optional)
* [[Cookbook:Pine Nut|pine nuts]] (optional)
* spicy [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]] or [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|chili]] (optional)
* [[Cookbook:Turmeric|Turmeric]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]

==Procedure==
# Add the meat to the onion and fry, adding 1 spoon of flavor to the cutlets of Bulgur that to the meat.
# Put both types of the Bulgur together, fill with warm water that will cover the Bulgur in several centimeters, and leave it for about an hour until part of the water is absorbed into the Bulgur.
# Take every time a handful and squeeze properly and put it in a different bowls until everything is finished, then pour off all the remaining water and return all the squeezed wheatgroats into the big bowl.
# Put 2 glasses of semolina, one teaspoon of Turmeric, a replete spoon of salt, and one egg, and massage everything together with your hands, including closing the hand fists until the dough gets a little like chewing gum. If semolina is missing, it is possible to add a little more to it according to the need, until we would get a sticky dough. 
# Create big balls of dough and put them aside. 
# Open every ball of dough and insert a full spoon of the meat and close. 
# Boil water in a pot with a little salt and Turmeric. When the water has boiled up, flatten every ball in the meat that we got in a somewhat shape of a flat full moon in the size of little plate. Put it gently in the boiling water until the Kibbeh will float, and this will be the sign that it is ready.

Kibbeh can be eaten immediately as it gets ready, or [[Cookbook:Pan Frying|pan fried]] on both sides. 

''Absolutely delicious.''

    <title>Cookbook:Æbleskiver</title>

[[Image:Aebleskiver.jpg|thumb|right|Æbleskiver.]]

'''Æbleskiver''' (Danish meaning ''apple slices'' in English (singular: ''æbleskive'')) are traditional [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Denmark|Danish]] [[Cookbook:cake|cake]]s, somewhat similar in texture to [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|American]] [[Cookbook:Pancake|pancakes]]. Æbleskiver are cooked in a special æbleskive pan, a [[Cookbook:Pots and Pans#Cast Iron|cast-iron pan]] with several hemispherical indentations in the bottom of the pan.

The English language spelling is usually '''ebleskiver''' or '''aebleskiver'''.

There are many recipes for æbleskiver. The following is offered as an example.

== Ingredients ==
* 2 [[Cookbook:Egg White|egg white]]s 
* 2 cups all-purpose [[Cookbook:flour|flour]] 
* 2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]] 
* 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:white sugar|white sugar]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]] 
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
* 4 tablespoons [[Cookbook:butter|butter]], melted 
* 2 cups [[Cookbook:buttermilk|buttermilk]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:vegetable oil|vegetable oil]], for [[Cookbook:frying|frying]]

== Directions ==
#Beat the whites stiff.
#Mix together the flour, baking powder, salt, baking soda, sugar, melted butter and buttermilk at one time and beat until smooth. Gently fold in the egg whites last. 
#Put about 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in the bottom of each æbleskiver pan cup and heat until hot. Pour in about 2 tablespoons of the batter into each cup. 
#As soon as they get bubbly around the edge, turn them quickly. Alternatively, you can turn them halfway first, so that the baked crusts protruding from the pan will look like the [[w:Sydney Opera House|Sydney Opera House]]. And after a while you turn them the remaining 90°. This will give them a perfect ball-shape. (Danish cooks use a long knitting needle, but a fork will work). Continue cooking, turning the ball to keep it from burning.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*An æbleskiver pan is '''required''' to cook these properly.
*They were traditionally cooked with bits of [[Cookbook:apple|apple]] (''æble'') or [[Cookbook:applesauce|applesauce]] inside but these ingredients are not normally included in modern Danish forms of the dish. 
*Æbleskiver are not sweet themselves but are traditionally sprinkled with [[Cookbook:Powdered Sugar|powdered sugar]], accompanied with [[Cookbook:raspberry|raspberry]] or sometimes [[Cookbook:strawberry|strawberry]] [[Cookbook:jam|jam]], and served with ''gløgg''.

[[Image:Hard boiled egg.jpg|right|thumb|Inside a hard-boiled egg]]

==Ingredients==
*any number of [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]

===Warnings===

* Unwashed eggs will keep 4-5 weeks in the coldest part of the refrigerator (NEVER in the door!)
* Boiled or washed eggs will only keep about a week-the protective cover over the shell is gone.
* Look at your eggs BEFORE you put them in your grocery cart! Never buy cracked or even dirty eggs.
* Eggs left out too long should not be eaten, i.e., Easter eggs are left out...

==Method==
# Put the eggs in a [[Cookbook:Saucepan|pot]].
# Fill pot with [[Cookbook:Water|water]]. Make sure that the tops of the eggs at covered by at least 25 mm (one inch).
# Bring to a rolling [[Cookbook:Boiling|boil]].
# Reduce heat to a low boil.
# Cook for 10 minutes.
# Drain the pot.
# Cool eggs immediately by running cold water over them or putting in iced water.
# Crack and peel the eggs under very cold running water, starting by cracking the large (air pocket) end, then taking off the largest pieces first. Lowering the eggs' temperature keeps the shells from sticking, and prevents the greenish tinge sometimes seen on hard-boiled eggs. (The greenish tinge doesn't affect taste or safety.)

===Tips, Notes, and Variations===

* An alternate method is to turn off the heat, cover the pot, and let stand 15 or 18 minutes.
* Salt in the water can help keep egg white from seeping out of a crack.
* Multiple layers of eggs in the pot are more likely to crack: use only a single layer and do another batch.
* Older eggs will be easier to peel, as the air space is larger.
* If the peeling becomes tragic, you can always make egg salad!

# After the eggplant is absolutely soft and most of its peel is blackened, put the eggplant on a board and cut it lengthwise. Keep the flesh of the eggplant and remove all the burned skin. 
# [[Cookbook:Mincing|Mince]] the eggplant with a knife to a [[Cookbook:Purée|purée]], keeping the seeds whole. The cutting should be done with a stainless steel chopper or wooden chopper. (In my opinion it is best to use a stainless steel chopper).
# Pass the roasted eggplant into a glass or plastic bowl and add between half a spoon to one full spoon of oil for every eggplant, and salt according to ones own taste. Then chop the onion in small pieces and add it in the eggplant salad. 
# Store in the refrigerator until serving time.

'''Aam panna''' is a green mango drink widely consumed in northern India during summer months. Apart from being delicious and refreshing, aam panna is believed to have several health benefits.

The recipe calls for green mangoes, sugar, rock salt, roasted cumin seeds and mint leaves. The quantities can (and should) be varied to suit individual taste preferences. This recipe yields a concentrate which can be stored for around 2 weeks in the refrigerator.

== Ingredients ==
*4 medium-sized green [[Cookbook:Mango|mangoes]]
*½ cup [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*2 level tablespoons [[Cookbook:Salt|rock salt]]
*1 level teaspoon roasted [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]] seeds
*A pinch of [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|red chilli powder]] / flakes
*A handful of fresh [[Cookbook:Mint|mint]] leaves

== Procedure ==
#Cut mangoes into 3 slices each - two from either side of the seed and one with the seed in it.
#[[Cookbook:Pressure Cooking|Pressure cook]] mangoes with one small cup of water. Turn off heat as soon as the pressure cooker whistles once.
#Open cooker after 5-7 minutes and leave to cool.
#Grind sugar and roasted cumin seeds using a [[Cookbook:Food Processor|food processor]]. (If using chilli flakes, grind that too.)
#Mince mint leaves in a food processor.
#When cool, squeeze pulp of mangoes into a [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]] using hands. Discard skin and seeds.
#[[Cookbook:Purée|Purée]] mango pulp until smooth.
#Add ground sugar, rock salt, roasted cumin leaves, chilli powder and minced mint leaves. Blend well.
#Store in clean plastic/ glass bottle. Refrigerate.

To serve, add 4-5 teaspoons of concentrate to a glass of water. Enjoy!

This a very easy and tasty [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]] [[Cookbook:Sauces|sauce]]. It's good with just pasta, and goes well with a lot of vegetables as well. The quantities of ingredients varies with the amount of pasta, and with your taste preferences.

== Ingredients ==
*[[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*[[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] cloves
*ripe [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]
*fresh [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]]
*[[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]]

== Procedure ==
#Finely chop tomatoes or [[Cookbook:Purée|purée]] them in a [[Cookbook:Food Processor|food processor]] - this depends on what consistency you want. Chopping gives a chunkier sauce while using puréed tomatoes yields a smoother sauce.
#Grind garlic to paste.
#Heat oil in a pan. Using a pan with non-stick coating needs less oil.
#When oil is hot (but not too hot), turn down heat and add garlic paste.
#When garlic is golden-brown, add tomatoes.
#Tomatoes have to be cooked until done - they'll look and smell cooked instead of raw, and will be a deeper, redder colour.
#Half way there, add salt and pepper.
#When tomatoes are almost done, add fresh cream (more if you want, but less is good too).
#After half a minute, add oregano.
#Cook for another minute, and your pasta sauce is ready.
#Add cooked pasta and vegetables and serve hot.

[[Image:Tempe mendoan fried tempeh.jpg|right|thumb|Tempe Mendoan]]

'''Tempe Mendoan''' is a kind of tempeh cooking that is made from thin tempeh, fried with flour so as to taste deliciously piquant.

Like the traditional [[Cookbook:Spanish_Omelet|Spanish omelet]], the frittata is a thick, hearty omelet filled with vegetables. A frittata may be filled with any variety of vegetables, cheeses, pastas, or meats. This recipe is for a simple vegetarian one.

==Ingredients==
* 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] cloves, [[Cookbook:Mincing|minced]]
* 1 bunch of fresh [[Cookbook:Asparagus|asparagus]], trimmed and chopped
* 8 large [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* 3 teaspoons of [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] (whole fat milk is best, but part skim would be fine.)
* 2 teaspoons of chopped fresh [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]] or 1 teaspoon dried basil
* pinch of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* pinch of ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]
* 3 tablespoons of [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan cheese]], grated

==Equipment==
*12-inch (30cm) oven-safe [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]] (i.e. no plastic or wooden handles)
*medium bowl
*[[Cookbook:Whisk|whisk]] or fork

==Procedure==
# In a bowl, beat together the eggs, milk, basil, salt and pepper. Set aside.
# Preheat broiler. Heat the olive oil in a large, heat-safe skillet over medium heat. 
# When the oil is hot, add the garlic and sauté until fragrant, about a minute. 
# Add the chopped asparagus and sauté for about 5 minutes until it begins to become tender. 
# Pour the egg mixture into the skillet and cook about 4 minutes or until bubbles begin to form in the center of the eggs. 
# Sprinkle the Parmesan cheese on top of the eggs and immediately transfer the pan to the oven. 
# Cook under the broiler until the top puffs and browns, about 3 minutes. 
# Remove the pan from the oven (careful, it will be hot!) and cut the frittata into wedges. 

Serve immediately with crusty bread and fresh fruit for a light spring dinner. Wrap leftovers (if there are any) in tin foil and chill in refrigerator. Leftover frittata makes a great sandwich: just allow the eggs to come to room temperature and place them between two slices of buttered, toasted bread. 

Serves 2.

==Variations==
* Try bitter greens like [[Cookbook:Swiss Chard|Swiss chard]], ruby chard, or [[Cookbook:Broccoli rabe|broccoli rabe]].
* [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|Bell peppers]], [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]], [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], and [[Cookbook:Zucchini|zucchini]] are all delicious in a frittata. 
* For a meat version, try adding cubed [[Cookbook:Ham|ham]], chopped [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]] or [[Cookbook:Pancetta|pancetta]], or any variety of [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausage]].
* Different cheeses can be used, such as fontina, cheddar, havarti, Emmenthal, or Pecorino Romano. 
* For a heartier frittata, you may also add half a cup of cooked, drained [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]] such as linguine, spaghetti, or even macaroni. 
* Adding breadcrumbs to the beaten eggs is another good way of adding bulk.

Really, the possibilities are endless.

'''Rakott Krumpli''' (potato casserole) is a traditional meal eaten by Hungarian Jews during the ''&quot;nine days&quot;''. These are the first nine days of the month of Av, when orthodox Jews refrain from eating meat, in remembrance of the destruction of the Temple.

==Ingredients==
* 6 medium [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]
* 4 [[Cookbook:Hard Boiled Eggs|hard boiled eggs]]
* 1 lbs Kolbasz (Hungarian sausage)
* 350 grams [[Cookbook:Sour Cream|sour cream]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste

==Procedure==
# Cook the potatoes for about twenty five minutes.
# Peel the potatoes and the eggs.  
# Slice eggs, potatoes and kolbasz into thick slices and arrange in alternating layers of potatoes, eggs then kolbasz, with sour cream on the top.
# Bake in a preheated oven at 220°C for about 35 minutes or until they turn a light brown.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* Jewish Hungarians would likely leave out the Kolbasz.  Aside from the fact that Hungarian sausage (kolbasz) is made from pork, our Jewish brethren would certainly not be combining any meat with the dairy sour cream (unless they are not strictly observant).

'''Soft boiled eggs''', a nice way to eat poached eggs without a plate, takes about 7 minutes to prepare.  Often served with buttered toast, perfect for dipping into the runny yolk.

==Ingredients==
*2 or 3 large [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]], depending on appetite
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste

==Equipment==
*A small [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]] (1 - 2 [[Cookbook:Quart|quarts]] / [[Cookbook:Liter|litres]])
*A small spoon or [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]]
*Gas or electric stove, at medium-high to high heat
*A sharp pin or tack (optional - see method 2)
*A [[Cookbook:Slotted Spoon|slotted spoon]] (optional - see method 2)

==Procedure==

There are several popular ways to make soft boiled eggs. Here are the most common ones.

===Method 1===
This is a method used widely in France that almost invariably leaves the yolk soft and runny but not watery. This method also avoids the requirement to pierce the shell.

#Using eggs which are more or less at room temperature (i.e. not straight from the refrigerator), place in water that has been brought to a &quot;furious&quot; boil. 
# After one minute, remove from heat and allow eggs to stand in the hot water in the pan for 5 minutes. 

===Method 2===
#Fill the pot ¾ full with water and set on stove top to boil.
#Using the pin, poke a small hole on the larger end of the egg. 
#When the water is boiling, use the slotted spoon to lower the eggs into the pot. 
#Let the eggs boil for 6-7 minutes (5 minutes 40 seconds for soft yolk).
#Remove the eggs with the slotted spoon.

===Method 3===
#Mix ½ tsp salt into enough water to cover your eggs, and bring the water to a soft boil.
#Put your eggs in the water and boil for 4-5 minutes.
#When they're done, immediately run them under cold water so they stop cooking.

==Serving==
#To serve, place eggs on an egg stand, shot glass, or anything that will allow the egg to stay upright.
#Using the small spoon, repeatedly tap the top of the eggs until an area the size of the spoon is cracked
#Dig the spoon across the bottom of the cracked area to remove the top.
#Use the spoon to eat from the egg shell.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*If you wait too long to serve, the heat of the egg will continue to cook the yolk. This effect can be reduced by cooling the eggs in cold water for up to 1 minute.
*Traditionally, people will slice buttered toast into long pieces and dip it into the eggs. This is called cutting bread into &quot;soldiers.&quot;
*Some people will add salt, pepper and sometimes butter, and scramble the eggs inside the shell.
*Others will dig out the egg and layer on their buttered toast.
*''Egg in a Cup'': dig out the egg and put it in a mug with buttered toast. Mix.

==Warnings==
*Many people prefer their eggs not fully cooked.  Please see the module ''[[Cookbook:Egg|Egg]]'' for possible health concerns of eating raw eggs.

[[Image:idly sambar vada.JPG|thumb|The South Indian staple breakfast item of idli, sambar, and vada served on a banana leaf.]]

'''Sambar''' or '''sambhar''' ([[w:Kannada language|Kannada]]: '''ಸಾಂಬಾರ್‍''', [[w:Tamil language|Tamil]] சாம்பார் (சாம்பாறு in Sri Lanka),[[w:Telugu language|Telugu]]: '''సాంబారు'''), pronounced &quot;saambaar&quot;, is a dish common in southern India and Sri Lanka, made of [[Cookbook:Dal|dal]] (usually [[Cookbook:Pigeon Pea|red gram]], also called ''toor dal'') and vegetables in a spicy [[Cookbook:Tamarind|tamarind]] and dal flour soup base. Sambar is usually poured over or alongside steamed rice. In the south of India, vada sambar and idli sambar are popular breakfast foods. 

Several minor variants exist depending on the meal of the day, region, and the vegetable used.  Sambar without dal (but with vegetables or fish) is called ''kozhambu'' in [[w:Tamil Nadu|Tamil Nadu]]. There are major and minor variants of kozhambu (''mor kozhambu'', ''vetha kozhambu'', ''rasavangi'' etc.) Note that there are minor but subtle differences in preparation between all the variants (for instance, whether vegetables are added to the tamarind water or vice versa, which make them taste different).

Sambar with rice is one of the main courses of both formal and everyday south Indian cuisine. It is also served with [[Cookbook:Idli|idli]], [[Cookbook:Dosa|dosa]] and [[Cookbook:Vada|vada]]. It is not uncommon to eat sambar rice with appalam (papad).

== Ingredients ==
*1 cup (240ml) [[Cookbook:Pigeon Pea|yellow lentils]] (arhar or toor dal)
*1½ cups [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
*1 tbsp [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1 tbsp [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*3 tbsp [http://www.bawarchi.com/contribution/contrib3453.html sambhar masala]*
*3 tbsp thickish [[Cookbook:Tamarind|tamarind pulp]] OR 1 tsp tamarind concentrate

*7-8 leaves of [[Cookbook:Curry Leaf|curry leaves]]

*[[Cookbook:Fenugreek|methi seed]]s (Uhuluva) - ¼ tablespoon
*1 tsp [[Cookbook:Asafoetida|asafoetidia]] (Kayam) (optional)
*1 big [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], cut into quarters 
*[[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] - 1 teaspoon (chopped)
*2 tbsp [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] or [[Cookbook:Ghee|ghee]]
*1 tbsp chopped [[Cookbook:Cilantro|coriander leaves]] (cilantro) to garnish.
*1 cup (240ml) mixed [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]], cut into approx.1&quot; cubes, e.g.
**[[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]]
**a medium sized [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]]
**[[Cookbook:Eggplant|brinjal]] (eggplant, aubergine, kath tharik kaai)
**[[Cookbook:Drumstick|drumsticks]]

''This is a wonderful dish that is very easy to do. It does call for the use of raw eggs, which is not to everyone's taste, but to the best of my knowledge, no one has died from Carbonara sauce poisoning!.''

I came across a website which provides an interesting description as to the origins of this sauce. It is supposed to have been popular with Italian coalminers, as the ingredients were simple to transport and, presumably, cook down a coalmine! Personally I think it is just a nice story as I have never heard of stoves and their inherent dangerous flames being allowed down a coalmine, but hey, I'm just a cook, not a miner !! (NB: carbonara is more likely named after the charcoal makers in the region, not coalminers)

{{see also|Cookbook:Spaghetti alla Carbonara}}

==Ingredients==

* 4 free-range [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]] with large yolks (double yolkers are particularly suitable!) The use of &quot;cheap&quot; eggs will have a marked effect on the sauce. Yolks as fresh and as yellow as possible please!
* 3oz [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian]] [[Cookbook:Pancetta|pancetta]]. PLEASE don't buy the ready cubed stuff, but the fresh, Italian version, with a little cracked pepper on the rind. If you really can't find it, smoked bacon will do
* 1 sprig of fresh [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]], finely chopped
* the chopped [[Cookbook:Zest|zest]] of ½ [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]
* 3oz [[Cookbook:Crème Fraîche|crème fraîche]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste

==Procedure==

# Put on the desired quantity of Pasta to cook. This complete dish is often referred to as &quot;Spaghetti Carbonara&quot; but using small Penne Rigate is, in my humble opinion, better.
# Split the eggs carefully and separate the yolks from the whites (a good - and rather sensuous - way of doing this is to run the egg through the almost closed fingers of your upturned palm, so as the white runs away through the fingers, and the yolk remains in your hand!) Keep the yolks in a large bowl (and use the whites for something useful, like [[Cookbook:Meringue|meringues]], if you must!) remembering to pick out that pesky little white bit which always remains behind when you split an egg.
# Fry the pancetta on a lowish heat in a dry frying pan until it is crispy. Always make sure you have more than enough for your sauce, as the temptation to snaffle a few bits of the pancetta whilst it is cooking is irresistible ! 
# When the pancetta is cooked, allow it to cool for a few minutes, before adding it to the yolks (allowing it to cool precludes you scrambling the eggs in the process of adding the piping hot fried pancetta)
# Add a pinch of rock-salt and a very generous amount indeed of ground pepper to the bowl.
# Add the crème frâiche to the bowl, as well as the lemon zest and the chopped thyme. Also add a small amount of the Parmigiano cheese to the bowl.
# Once the pasta is cooked, the '''MOST''' important thing is to get your guests to sit down at the table ...!! This dish waits for NO man, woman or child !! It '''HAS''' to be served as soon as it is ready. No ifs or buts here !
# Drain the pasta through a [[Cookbook:Colander|colander]], count to 10, which seems to allow the pasta to cool just a tad, so again it does not scramble the sauce, and add it to the carbonara mixture.
# Mix it through with a wooden spoon and serve immediately, sprinkling the remaining Parmigiano cheese over the top!!

''If you want to add a little chopped flat leaf parsley (not the curly stuff) to add colour go ahead.''

Served with a simple green salad, it's delicious.

Buon Appetito, Wikipedies

'''Barbecue Sauce''' is a [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]] or [[Cookbook:Ketchup|ketchup]] based [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce]] used on [[Cookbook:Meat|meats]]. Kansas City-style barbecue sauce is the most common version used in the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|United States]]. It is tomato or ketchup based with sweet, sour and smoky elements. Barbecue sauce can be added to the meat before, during or after cooking. This version contains quite a bit of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]], so it should be added near the end or after cooking the meat to avoid burning the sauce.

==Ingredients==
*1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (235 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Ketchup|ketchup]]
*6 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] (90 mL) [[Cookbook:Worcestershire Sauce|Worcestershire sauce]]
*4 tablespoons (60 mL) [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
*3 tablespoons (45 mL) white [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
*1 tablespoon (15 mL) plain prepared [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]]
*3 tablespoons (45 mL) finely minced yellow [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*4 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] (20 mL) bottled [[Cookbook:Liquid Smoke|liquid smoke]] flavor (hickory)
*1/4 teaspoon (1 mL) Louisiana-style [[Cookbook:Red Pepper|red pepper]] [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce]]
*1/2 cup (120 mL) [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]]
*1 tablespoon (15 mL) [[Cookbook:Granulated Sugar|granulated sugar]]
*1 teaspoon (5 mL) [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

Makes 2 cups (470 mL) of sauce.

==Procedure==
#Combine all ingredients in a sauce pan.
#Mix well.
#[[Cookbook:Simmer|Simmer]] over low heat for 20-minutes, stirring occasionally.

==Notes, tips and variations==

#This sauce tastes very close to commercial barbecue sauces such as Masterpiece and Bullseye.

==Warnings==
* Keep refregerated
* Add to meat near end or after cooking to avoid burning sauce because of sugar content.

This is a simple barbecue [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce]] that works well for everyday meals, even with leftover [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]] and picky eaters. It is best served with soda (pop) and [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]], and perhaps also [[Cookbook:Steaming|steamed]] [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]].

The ideal meat to use would be thin slices of eye-of-round [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] roast. The sauce also goes well with [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]], [[Cookbook:Turkey|turkey]], and [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]].

Note that the measurements are very rough, in part because molassas is too sticky to properly measure, and in part because liquid smoke flavoring strength will vary by supplier. You may need to adjust things a bit for the proper taste.

==Ingredients==

* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Ketchup|ketchup]] (catsup)
* 1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Molasses|molasses]]
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] &quot;concentrated&quot; [[Cookbook:Liquid Smoke|liquid smoke]] flavoring

==Procedure==

#Mix everything in a pot.

That's it. You'll want to heat the sauce with some pre-cooked [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]] in it of course.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}}

This is the recipe we all have dreamed of cooking. Everyone who has ever been to Italy has eaten this. It is one of the iconic recipes from the land of Pasta !! It's so simple - though the ending a little excruciating - and so long as you can obtain fresh clams (or carpet clams as they are sometimes called) you are sure of a real feast for your guests !

{{see also|Cookbook:Linguine Vongole}}

== Ingredients ==

* [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* 8 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] [[Cookbook:Clam|clams]] or carpet clams as they are sometimes known
* 2 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* large or very large pinch of [[Cookbook:Red Pepper|red peppers]] (dried is fine) depending on taste
* ½ cup of white [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]]
* The [[Cookbook:Zest|zest]] or the juice of 1 [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]
* The zest of ½ [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]]
* [[Cookbook:Pasta|spaghetti]], enough for the number of people to be served
* a handful of flat leaf [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]]
* 1 oz salted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]

== Procedure ==

# Put a large saucepan of water on, and when at a rolling boil, put in the spaghetti, keeping an eye on the cooking time to ensure that the spaghetti is NEVER overcooked
# Put the clams into a separate small saucepan with the white wine and poach gently for about 2 minutes. Take off the heat and set aside
# Pour a generous quantity of olive oil into a small frying pan and heat
# Add the garlic cloves which have been either chopped or put through a garlic crush
# Add the chillies and the chopped parsley and the lemon zest 
# Heat everything for about 3 minutes.
# Now add about ½ of the white wine the clams were cooked in.
# Continue to heat for a few minutes on a high heat to induce a slight reduction.
# Add the cooked clams to the sauce and turn the heat off completely.
# Once the pasta is cooked drain it through sieve or colander and return to the saucepan.
# Add the Salted butter to the pasta and mix through thoroughly. This will induce the sauce to thicken a little.
# Add the cooked clams to the sauce and the the pasta.
# Mix up thoroughly ensuring you do not damage the clams
# Serve in a high-sided bowl, ensuring that each guest gets his fair share of clams

''Why should the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italians]] have all the luck when it comes to meatballs, delicious as they may be ? I say let others get a look in, and here we have a recipe from Germany which is easy and utterly delicious. And not a tomato in sight!! These are known in Germany as Konigsberge Klopse, or sometimes as Konigsberger Klopsies !! 

''Konigsberg, also now known as Kaliningrad is, somewhat disappointingly, not in Germany at all but is in the Russian exclave (whatever that is!!) between Lithuania and Poland, but was formerly a part of the German province of East Prussia.''

''Whether the meatballs should thus be renamed &quot;''Russian Exclave meatballs''&quot; is a subject for those more qualified than I to discuss !! My view is that &quot;Konigsberger Kloepse&quot; or even German Meatballs sound rather more palatable.''

== Ingredients ==

* 8 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] (225[[Cookbook:Gram|g]]) of low fat [[Cookbook:Mincing|minced]] [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]
* 8 oz (225g) of minced [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]]
* 1 large [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]] (peeled and chopped)
* 5 [[Cookbook:Anchovy|anchovy]] fillets chopped finely
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Caper|capers]]
* ¼ bottle of Riesling white [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]]
* 6 fl oz of [[Cookbook:Crème Fraîche|crème fraîche]]
* 1 tablespoon of [[Cookbook:Mixed Herbs|mixed herbs]]
* 1 large [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
* 2 - 3 slices of brown [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] or a roll, soaked in [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* juice of 2 [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemons]]
* [[Cookbook:Zest|zest]] of 2 [[Cookbook:Lime|limes]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Clove|cloves]]
* ½ tablespoon of [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and freshly ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* 2 tablespoon of [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] mixed with water to form a [[Cookbook:Roux|roux]]

== Procedure ==

# Finely chop the onion and fry it until translucent making sure it does not brown in any way, and then add to the minced beef and pork mixture.
# Soak the brown bread or roll in water, and then also add to the minced meat.
# Add Pepper, salt, chopped anchovy fillets, egg and mixed herbs to the mince, mix everything together by hand - ''a wonderfully messy operation. Get someone you dislike, or maybe even a favoured child, to do it for you if you can't face the prospect of getting covered up to your fetlocks in mince !!'' - and start forming little meatballs about ¾ inch in diameter. 
# To make them, take a quantity of the mince mixture in your hands and form it into a round shape. Then gently roll them between your palms so they (yes, the meatballs, stoopid!) become as round as possible. Don't become obsessed with shape here, it doesn't matter if they are neither symmetrical or the same size as each other !!
# Lay side by side on a flat surface (otherwise they will roll off and fall on the floor, ha ha!) 
# Bring at least 2 pints of water to a rolling simmer, and add the lemon juice, the cloves, the olive oil to it, and gently drop in the meatballs. Don't overcrowd the pan, if need be drop the meatballs in in 2 goes.
# As soon as the meatballs rise to the surface, remove them with a slotted spoon and set aside keeping warm (them, not you !)
# Now add the wine, the crème fraîche and the flour mixture (called a roux) to the water and reduce a little and thicken. There should be plenty of sauce for this dish, so rather than rely on reducing the sauce to thicken it, don't be afraid of adding more roux to achieve this.
# As the sauce begins to thicken, return the meatballs to the sauce and continue to cook for another 10 minutes or so.
# At the last moment add the capers and the zest of the limes.
# Adjust your seasoning to suit your taste.
# Pour the entire contents of the pan through a semi-fine sieve (''for goodness sake remember to put another saucepan underneath the sieve to catch the sieved sauce, or else your entire sauce will slip down the plug'' !!) which will get rid of the &quot;bits&quot;.
# Heat up the sauce again if needed, add the meatballs in the sieve, and a handful of capers (they don't actually need cooking) according to your taste and you are ready to go.

This version of meatballs are best served with boiled, waxy [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] which can be ''scrunshed'' into the sauce to make it all the more delicious !!

* 1 tsp. [[Cookbook:ginger|ginger]], preferably freshly grated
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|T]] [[Cookbook:honey|honey]]
* 2 T [[Cookbook:Matsoh Meal|matsoh meal]]

== Procedure ==
# Plump dried fruit in juice.
# Mash reconstituted fruit with almond and spices to get a mortar-like texture.
# Adjust texture with matsoh meal and if needed, sweeten with honey.

''Summer Pudding is a quintessentially British dessert made from wonderful fresh ingredients only available in the summer months. 

''It is redolent of a private dinner at a smart country house, maybe somewhere in the Surrey hills near Shere, with the taste of an exquisite first course still lingering, a bottle of chilled champagne still half full, and the prospect of more enticing conversation to come as the evening turns into night !! (That's enough gloopy stuff, thanks! Ed.) Once you make it once, you'll make it again and again !''''

== Ingredients ==

* 1 [[Cookbook:Punnet|punnet]] [[Cookbook:Strawberry|strawberries]]
* 1 punnet [[Cookbook:Raspberry|raspberries]]
* ½ punnet [[Cookbook:Currant|blackcurrants]]
* ½ punnet [[Cookbook:Currant|redcurrants]]
* 1 loaf of white, sliced, pappy sort of [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] or, for a special treat, a large slab of Brioche
* 2 Tbsp [[Cookbook:Caster sugar|caster sugar]]
* the [[Cookbook:Zest|zest]] of a [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]] chopped finely
* 2 or 3 [[Cookbook:Mint|mint]] leaves again, finely chopped
* a bottle of the best quality blackcurrant cordial you can find, in reserve

== Procedure ==

First you will need to find yourself a pudding bowl about 5 inches in diameter which you will need to butter well on the inside. It should preferably however NOT be greater in diameter that the size of your (assumedly square) pieces of sliced white bread or brioche. 

If you are worried about getting the whole thing out of the bowl in one piece, line the bowl first with some cling film. It's a fiddly job, but ensures you get a perfect shape at the end !!

Take the Blackcurrants and redcurrants, mint leaves and Lime zest and turn them into a saucepan. Add the sugar and about 3 Tbsp Water, and on the lowest possible heat setting of your cooker, poach them for about 5 minutes. Add the strawberries - having cut any large ones in half - and poach for another minute.

Turn the heat OFF and add the raspberries.   Leave to cool

''Now for the fun part !!''

Take your bowl and using it as a cutter, cut a circle out of the white bread the same diameter as the ''top'' of the bowl itself.

Now find a cup or glass that is roughly the same diameter as the ''bottom'' of your bowl and do the same.

Next, using a sharp knife for both cutting and as a measuring implement, slice the white bread (''no crusts allowed''!!) into squares or oblongs, roughly the same ''height'' as the bowl which will be used to line the inside of the bowl. This does not have to be an exact science, but close is good !!

In simple terms what we are trying to do is to line the bowl with the white bread.

Now, lay the small circle of white bread on the bottom of the bowl. Put the oblongs of white bread up the side of the bowl, overlapping slightly, and pour the fruit mixture into the void right up to the top. don't be mean with the juice either. The bread should become well soaked in the juice from the cooked fruit. 

Indeed if there is not enough juice to soak the bread so it turns very red, use the cordial as a top-up.

Now, complete the mould, and place the large circle, or disc, of bread on the top and press it down well.

It's now necessary to press the whole thing down, so that the sauce sort of glues the bread together and so please find a weight or something that fits into the top of the bowl so it squashes everything down tight, and place it in the fridge for at least 40 minutes.

When you are ready to serve the pudding, carefully using a knife, release the bread mould from the side of the bowl, and invert the whole thing onto a plate. 

If things become a little fraught and wobbly at this point, don't panic, and sort of whack everything back into shape using a wooden spoon.

Decorate your plate with some more summer fruit, maybe a couple of mint leaves and an artistic dollop of fresh whipped cream or crème fraîche and serve with a flourish.

'''Turkey and Lima beans''' is a simple dish with a rich flavour. The turkey mince, simmered in the same water used to cook the Lima beans, produces a flavoursome broth, and the sage really sets off the dish nicely. Great when served over [[Cookbook:Rice|steamed rice]].

==Ingredients==

* 500 [[Cookbook:Gram|g]] (1 [[Cookbook:Pound|lb]]) [[Cookbook:Turkey|turkey]] [[Cookbook:Mincing|mince]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] dried [[Cookbook:Lima Bean|Lima beans]]
* 1-2 [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], sliced
* 2-3 sticks of [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]]
* a handful of fresh [[Cookbook:Sage|sage]], chopped (or 1-2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] of dried sage)
* 2 tsp ground [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander seed]]
* 1 tsp ground [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]]
* 1-2 tsp [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili]] flakes or powder (or hot [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]])
* 2-3 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|Tbs]] [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]], to taste
* [[Cookbook:Water|water]]

==Procedure==

# Soak the dried beans overnight, or at least 6 hours.
# Drain the soaked beans, discarding the water. Cover the beans with water in a small pot, bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Stir periodically, and start testing for tenderness after 10 minutes. Alternatively, cook in a [[Cookbook:Pressure Cooking|pressure cooker]] at 15 PSI for 3 minutes, and set aside to depressurise.
# While the beans are cooking, add olive oil to a large pan and heat. When hot, add the onion and celery, and [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sauté]] until translucent.
# Add the cumin, coriander, chili, and pepper to the pan and stir in. Allow to sauté for another couple of minutes.
# Add the turkey mince to the pan, and turn up the heat. Stir while browning the mince, breaking up large pieces. Ensure that all the mince is browned.
# Tip the beans, with their cooking water, into the pan and stir in the salt and sage. Simmer for 15 minutes (e.g. while cooking some rice!)

Serve over steamed [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] - it goes very nicely with arborio rice!

==Notes, tips and variations==
* Canned Lima beans may be used, to short-cut the preparation of this meal. Rinse well before use.
* Lima beans work wonderfully well with turkey or [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]], but other beans may be used instead if more convenient - I've found that [[Cookbook:Black-Eyed Pea|black-eyed peas]] are almost as good.
* If a thicker sauce is desired, stir in some [[Cookbook:Manioc Flour|manioc flour]], a tablespoon at a time until almost thick enough, while still hot. Alternatively, don't add all of the liquid from cooking the beans.

# To serve, make a pyramid of rice in the center of each of 4 bowls, then ladle hot stew around rice.
# [[Cookbook:Garnish|Garnish]] with parsley, if desired.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

''This is going to be a contentious one !! There are SO many ways of doing this recipe that no one person can provide the definitive recipe. But, on the basis that the generous readers of Wikipedia recipes will accept that this is only one man's interpretation of a well-loved and delicious recipe... here goes !! Please do feel free to add suggestions on how YOU do this perennial favourite !''

== Ingredients ==

* 200 [[Cookbook:Gram|g]] of fresh [[Cookbook:Salmon|salmon]]
* 200 g of smoked [[Cookbook:Haddock|haddock]]
* 100 g [[Cookbook:Shrimp|prawns]]
* 100 g [[Cookbook:Mussel|mussels]]
* 5 [[Cookbook:Scallop|scallops]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Pound|lb]] (1 [[Cookbook:Kg|kg]]) [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]
&lt;!-- commented out because the peas aren't used in the recipe * 1 bag frozen [[Cookbook:Pea|peas]] (how big?) --&gt;
* [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]]
* [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* ¼ [[Cookbook:Pint|Pt]] (150 [[Cookbook:ML|ml]]) fresh single [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaves]]
* [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 50 g Ementhaler or Appenzeller cheese, grated.

== Procedure ==

# Take all the fish and place it all in a saucepan with sufficient milk so that the fish is submerged.
# Add the bay leaf and a pinch of salt
# Poach on a low heat for about 5 minutes
# Remove the fish from the pan, skin the haddock and the salmon, and flake, using a fork, into pieces.
# Return to the milk and set aside.
# Peel and boil the potatoes until they are soft enough to mash. This will take at least 20 minutes of boiling, otherwise the mash may remain lumpy (''and who wants lumpy mash !!??'')
# The potato needs to be mashed very well indeed, and for this I personally recommend an electric whisk after the initial crushing of the potatoes.
# Pour some of the milk into the potatoes so that the taste of fish infuses into it. 
# The mash should not get too runny, but add some of the cream and grate some nutmeg into the potato as well.
# Now put the cooked fish into the bottom of an oven-proof dish, with any remaining milk sauce. The dish should not be too large as it is nice to build a couple of layers of the fish, rather than lay it out in one layer. Once you have done this, pat the fish gently down a little so that it is slightly compacted.
# Now spread the mashed potato over the top of the fish to a height of about 1½ inches (38mm) making sure it is flat, and not piled up in the middle. Using a fork, ridge the top of the potato as this will make it colour up nicely in the oven.
# At this stage, if you want, add the grated cheese over the potato, and if you are feeling artistic, decorate the top of the pie with some large peeled prawns around the edge of the fish, and maybe a decoration in the middle.
# Place the pie in the oven at 220°C and leave for about 30 minutes or so, until the top of the potato/grated cheese is nicely coloured and the potato is bubbling nicely.
# Remove from the oven and serve immediately.

A good accompaniment to fish pie is [[Cookbook:samphire|samphire]] if you can get it (boil it for 10 minutes, add butter and maybe a little grated Parmesan cheese) or a lovely, fresh green salad.

''If you have the misfortune to suffer any serious ailment, such as hypochondria, or are of a nervous disposition, or are worried sick about your carbon footprint and think that sending a cheque to some &quot;offset company&quot; in Mongolia will do the trick, please keep away from this recipe !!''

''It is dynamite and will give you a guilty conscience for the next month !! If you are none of the above, and all you want to do in the years to come is die with a smile on your face, enjoy it, remembering though to check your blood pressure in the morning !!''

== Ingredients ==

* 500 [[Cookbook:Gram|g]] of the strongest Mountain or Valley [[Cookbook:Gorgonzola Cheese|Gorgonzola cheese]] you can buy. (''I don't care what anyone else says, an alternative cheese will NOT do!!'') 
* a few drops of [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* 150 g [[Cookbook:Ricotta Cheese|ricotta cheese]]
* a pinch of [[Cookbook:Mixed Herbs|mixed Herbs]]
* grated [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]]
* [[Cookbook:Zest|zest]] of one [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]
* on standby - 1 glass of fresh [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* penne or your favourite [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]] (though a &quot;ridged&quot; pasta is the best for this recipe!)
* water

== Procedure ==

# Put on the pasta to cook in plenty of salted water.
# Add the drops of olive oil to a preferably cast-iron saucepan, and crumble the pieces of Gorgonzola into it, on a VERY low heat. The cheese will melt and become runny, at which point add the ricotta cheese and continue to melt until the whole lot becomes a sauce.
# If the sauce remains too thick, add a little of the milk and heat up once again.
# Grate in plenty of nutmeg and add the mixed herbs and leave to stand for a little while.
# Once the pasta is cooked, drain well and tip into a mixing bowl.
# Add the Gorgonzola sauce, and using a wooden spoon, mix well.

Serve, as with ALL Pasta sauces, immediately.

Buon Appetito, Wikipedies !!

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}}

''I invented this recipe for children as it combines ingredients that they seem to love. It is also excruciatingly easy to make, and it very tasty. The ingredients, all &quot;good&quot; ingredients, can normally be obtained in any food outlet - not necessarily a supermarket, so it is good for &quot;last minute&quot; and, lastly, it needs only one pan to cook.''

== Ingredients ==

''It is always difficult to provide exact quantities when suggesting a recipe, as it all rather depends on how many people you are cooking for. Let us however assume you are cooking for 4 people.''

* 1 mugful of your favourite dried [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]] per person
* 1 400 gr container of plain Philadelphia [[Cookbook:Cream Cheese|cream cheese]] 
* 1 410 gr tin of [[Cookbook:Corn|sweetcorn]]
* 1 tin of [[Cookbook:Tuna|tuna]] of equal size to the sweet corn
* 3 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] of [[Cookbook:Pesto|pesto]]
* A little ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]

== Procedure ==

# Put the pasta on to boil in copious amounts of water with a little salt and a drop of olive oil added.
# In a mixing bowl combine all the rest of the ingredients.
# When the pasta is cooked, drain through a colander and add to the bowl.
# Stir through, so that everything becomes well coated.

''Please bear in mind that a REAL Italian will always thoroughly mix up the pasta and the sauce in a large bowl before serving. Serving the &quot;naked&quot; pasta on the plate, and plonk the sauce on top of it is both lazy and defeats the object of a pasta sauce!''

Serve immediately

A further thing about this dish is that it is equally delicious as a cold pasta salad, so make plenty of it for lunch, and have it cold for dinner.

{{recipesummary|Pizza recipes|4-6 (2 medium pizzas: 8 slices each)|90 minutes|3|Image=[[Image:PeperonniPizza.jpg|300px]]}}

==Ingredients==
;Pizza dough:
* 1 [[Cookbook:cup|cup]] of warm [[Cookbook:water|water]] 
* 3 [[Cookbook:tablespoon|tbsp]] of [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]]
* 1 tbsp of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:pound|lb]] of [[Cookbook:flour|all purpose flour]]
* ¼ [[Cookbook:cup|cup]] of [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]

;Toppings:
* [[Cookbook:Pepperoni|pepperoni]]
* 8 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]]. of [[Cookbook:Mozzarella Cheese|mozzarella cheese]]
* ½ 15[[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]]. can of Hunt's Family Favorites Pizza sauce
* 1 small [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]] finely diced
* 1 small [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|red pepper]] finely diced
* 3 ½ [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]]. of sliced [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]]
* [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]], [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], and [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]

==Procedure==
# Dissolve yeast and sugar in one cup or warm water.
# Mix 3 cups of flour, olive oil, one [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] of salt and water &amp; yeast mix.
# Knead for 15 minutes, adding more flour until dough gets &quot;non-sticky&quot;.
# Cover dough with little oil (1 tsp) and place it into a large bowl. Let rest 45 minutes until the dough is twice its original size, covering bowl with plastic wrap.
# Meanwhile, preheat oven at 350°F / 175°C (at least 30 minutes).
# Hit / knead dough in order to eliminate air bubbles.
# Cut dough into two pieces (you can freeze dough to bake later - up to a month).
# Roll out dough to form a rounded pizza crust.
# Add pizza sauce (½ can per pizza), and sprinkle onion, red pepper, salt, oregano and black pepper.
# Bake 10 minutes.
# Take out of the oven, add mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, and mushrooms.
# Take back to the oven and bake until cheese melts.
# Cut into eight slices, and enjoy!!!

==Variations, Tips==
# Water must be warm in order to activate yeast, but not boiling. Boiling water will spoil yeast.
# You can replace ¼ of water cup with milk, white or red wine.
# You can also replace sugar with 1 tbsp of honey.
# If you like a stronger cheese flavor, you can add on top of ingredients, little chunks of [[Cookbook:Blue Cheese|Blue Cheese]].
# Never wash the mushrooms with water, in order to make pizza. Mushrooms are like sponges, and will lose unwanted water to your pizza. You can clean it with dry paper towels.
# You can try different toppings to basic pizza dough, and even add cheese borders. To do so, you should roll out pizza into a larger size, adding cheese one [[Cookbook:Inch|inch]] from the border, and little pizza sauce. Roll dough over the cheese and press firmly to close.

'''Khichuri''' is a Bengali cuisine once considered [[w:en:Comfort food|comfort food]] for the poor, now is a delicacy served warm in [[w:en:Monsoon|Monsoon]] rain. Like similar [[Cookbook:Khichdi|Khichdi]], core ingredients are [[Cookbook:rice|rice]] and [[Cookbook:lentil|lentil]]s, but different variations exist, some adding vegetables, poultry or meat and named accordingly (e. g. ''Sabji khichuri'' for vegetable). Here is the recipe for the popular ''Bhuna Khichuri''.   

== Ingredients ==
[[Image:Khichuri-edit.jpg|thumb|Khichuri before garnish. Note the yellow colour is from Turmeric powder, lentils never give such vibrant colur.]]
*1 [[Cookbook:cup|cup]] white fragrant [[Cookbook:rice|rice]] (e.g Bashmati rice or short grained Pilau rice)
*1 cup green gram or red split [[Cookbook:lentil|lentil]]s (rice : lentil should be 1:1)
*½ cup split [[Cookbook:chickpea|chickpea]]s (preferably dried Bengal variety) (optional)
*½ cup [[Cookbook:Pea|garden peas]] (optional)
*2 [[Cookbook:tablespoon|tablespoon]]s [[Cookbook:butter|butter]] preferably [[Cookbook:ghee|ghee]]
*½ [[Cookbook:teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric powder]] (to give the dish a vibrant yellow colour)
*2 whole green [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili]]s slit in the middle, de-seeded if heat is not desired
*[[Cookbook:salt|salt]] according to taste
*4 cups of water for boiling
'''Spices for seasoning'''
*2 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaves]]
*4 [[Cookbook:Cardamom|green cardamom pods]]
*4 whole [[Cookbook:Clove|cloves]]
*2 sticks of [[Cookbook:cinnamon|cinnamon]] 1 inch long
*¼ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin seeds]]
*2 cm piece of [[Cookbook:ginger|ginger]], finely chopped
'''For garnish'''
*1 medium or 2 small [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], thinly sliced
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:butter|butter]] preferably [[Cookbook:ghee|ghee]]
*1 bunch coarsely chopped fresh [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]] leaves

== Procedure ==


==== Step 1 ====
*Rinse rice, lentils and chickpeas ( if using dried chickpeas) in cold water separately.
*Dry rice in a [[w:en:Colander|colander]] or on a flat surface.
*Leave lentils and chickpeas to soak in water for 30 minutes.
==== Step 2 ====
*Drain lentils and chickpeas; then roast them briefly until they emit an aroma, set aside to cool
*Heat water in a kettle to use later. Add it to the cooking before it boils thoroughly.
*Semi-crush cardamom, cinnamon and cloves
==== Step 3 ====
*Heat 2 tbsp butter in a heavy based pan in medium flame. Throw in bay leaf and semi-crushed spices in the hot melted butter, once they start to sputter (in less than a minute) add sliced ginger and cumin. Stir in 1-2 minutes until ginger yields a nutty flavour. Put green chili and garden pea and stir once or twice.
*Then add rice to the mixture and stir gently for 2-3 minutes making sure the oil coats it thoroughly. Add lentils, chickpeas and salt; stir again for 1-2 more minutes 
*Add hot water to the pan. The level of water should be approx 1 inch above the mixture. Lower the heat slightly, cover and [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]] until done. Check regularly to make sure rice does not burn at the bottom. Rice and lentils are done when there is no hard part in rice, it is medium firm, each one is easily separable, but not very soft or sticky. This should take around 10 minutes.

==== Step 4 ====
*When the rice is simmering take a separate frying pan and heat the remaining butter. Fry the onion on a medium heat until it starts to brown. 
*When rice mixture is done put onion with accompanying oil on top. Garnish with coriander
*Turn down the heat to the lowest and cover until served which should not take long.

== Ritual Eating! ==
''Bhuna khichuri'' is a romantic dish especially suited for a rainy day. Serve warm with Bengal fish curry and [[w:en:Chutney|Chutney]] as a [[w:en:condiment|condiment]].

== Tips, Notes, and Variations ==
Weight watchers may replace butter with a low fat vegetable oil or it can be omitted altogether. For oil free alternative dry toast the spices. Pour hot water over rice and lentil mix, then add onion, ginger and spices.

== Warnings ==
Slicing onions may irritate eyes. This can be avoided by cutting under water, not very convenient though! Ethnic ingredient shops often sell fried onion pack.

{{recipe}}  |  [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Poland|Cuisine of Poland]]

'''Pierogi''' are Polish dumplings that are typically filled with potatoes, cheese, meat, sauerkraut and mushrooms or wild fruits (strawberries, blueberries, etc.).

== Ingredients ==
*  1 tbs. [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] 
*  ½ cup cold water
*  1-2 eggs large  [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]] 
*  3½ cups  [[Cookbook:Flour|Flour]], plus extra for rolling dough
*  ~1 cups water
*  1½ tbs. unsalted  [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], melted
* 1 recipe [[Cookbook:Pierogie Filling:Saurkraut Filling|sauerkraut filling]] or [[Cookbook:Pierogie Filling:Cheese Filling|cheese filling]].

== Procedure ==
=== Dough ===
# Place flour in a large bowl.
# In a measuring cup, combine the salt, eggs, and the ½ cup cold water, and beat well with a fork.  Add those ingredients to flour and mix with your hands until blended.  Slowly mix in the remaining water (you do not have to add the entire cup, just keep adding until the dough feels wet).  Add the butter and knead until there are no lumps and it feels very smooth. This should take 15 minutes.  
# Cover and refrigerate the dough for at least 1 hour, but for best results let it sit in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours.

=== Assembly ===

# Divide the dough into thirds and roll out each on a lightly floured surface until the dough is approximately ⅛ inch thick.
# With a cup or glass, cut as many circles as possible out of the dough, but do not lift them off the work surface.
# Remove the excess dough from the work surface, and roll the circles until they become completely flattened.  This might require the additional sprinkling of flour on the dough.
# Carefully lift each circle of dough from the table (a spatula helps) and put between 1 tsp. and 1 tbs. of filling in its center.  The amount would vary depending on the size of the glass that was used to cut the dough.  For each circle, fold dough over to form a half-moon shape, and pinch edges closed, making sure there are no air pockets.
# Repeat for the remaining dough. 

=== Boiling ===
# Place no more than ⅓ of the pierogi at a time in boiling salted water for 5-10 minutes.  
# Drain in colander and lightly rinse with cold water-- this will prevent them from sticking together. 
# Serve immediately or fry in butter.  

== Notes ==
{{Wikipedia|Pierogi}}
* These will freeze well for up to 6 weeks. Prior to boiling them, place each pieróg on a floured sheet of wax paper, being careful not to have them touching. Stack sheets on top of each other and place in an airtight freezer bag.
* A standard recipe for mashed potatoes can also be used as filling.

==Procedure:==
;To prepare rice:

# Let stand one day long under the sun (this is called &quot;Orear&quot;).

;Building the &quot;Pasteles&quot;:
# Place one leaf of cabbage in top of a clean working area.
# Spread ⅛ cup of &quot;Oreado Rice&quot; over the cabbage leaf.
# Place one unit of each meat evenly through the pastel.

{{recipesummary|Stew recipes|6|1 Day (Cooking: 1 Hour)|3|Image=[[Image:Frijoles_Vanegas.jpg|300px]]}}

'''Antioqueño Beans''' is an icon of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Colombia|Colombian Typical Food]]. Are main ingredient of what I consider the National dish: [[Cookbook:Bandeja Paisa|Bandeja Paisa (Paisa's Tray)]], and generally used in the [[Cookbook:Calentao|Calentao]].

==Ingredients==
* 1 [[Cookbook:pound|lb]] of [[Cookbook:Kidney Bean|Red]] or [[Cookbook:Cargamanto|Cargamanto]] [[Cookbook:Bean|beans]]
* 2 red [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] of chopped [[Cookbook:Scallion|scallions]]
* ¼ cup of [[Cookbook:Oil|Oil]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|Tbs]] of [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]]
* 1 Tbs of [[Cookbook:Allspice|allspice]]
* 6 cups of [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Bouillon Cubes|cube]] of [[Cookbook:Stock|chicken broth]]
* 1 large [[Cookbook:Plantain|plantain]] (I like to use it very ripe, it gives a sweet taste to the beans)
* optional: add ½ [[Cookbook:pound|lb]] of [[w:Flank steak|flank steak]]], [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] legs, or [[w:Chicharrones|pork rinds]]

==Procedure==
# Wash beans and let hydrate overnight by covering with twice its amount in water.
# Next day, remove floating beans.
# I strongly recommend to use a [[Cookbook:Pressure Cooking|pressure cooker]], which will save you plenty of time when cooking the beans.
# Heat the oil in the pressure cooker. Add scallions and let fry until it starts getting brown. Add tomato, cumin, cubed chicken broth and allspice. This is called &quot;Hogao&quot;, a basic sauce for many Colombian dishes.
# Add 6 cups of water, the beans, and plantain. Cook in medium heat until it boils.
# Cover the pressure cooker, and let cook for 30 minutes.
# Let cool, and open pressure cooker (I use to pull up the pressure valve with a knife, to let steam get out faster, but do so only if used to work with this type or pan).
# Check water amount, and add optional beef / pork and close back. Cook for additional 30 minutes.
# Check salt. If you wish them thicker, you can cook uncovered at low heat.

==Variations, Tips==
* When serving, you can put additional hogao, on top of it.
* You can serve it with white rice, avocado, ground beef, roasted beef, fried plantain, roasted chicken, corn &quot;arepa&quot; and many other combinations.
* &quot;Trasnochado Beans&quot; (or eaten one day after being cooked) are a great option to eat beans with a delicious concentrated flavor.
* If you want to build a Paisa's Tray (Bandeja Paisa), you should serve a portion of Antioqueño beans, a portion of white rice, a portion of ground beef, a slice of avocado, one fried sausage (Chorizo), fried ripe plantain, one fried blood sausage, pork rind, and one fried egg on top of the rice. Enjoy it!!!.
* Another delicious option for Antioqueño Beans, are the &quot;Cazuelitas&quot; (Small Casserole). You serve half of a casserole with Antioqueño Beans, and add to it corn, shredded beef (&quot;Ropa Vieja&quot;), avocado (cubed), and ground pork rind.

[[Image:Steinpilzrisotto.jpg|right|thumb|300px]]

'''''Risotto ai funghi''' is probably the most renowned of all risotto dishes, and should ideally be cooked with porcini mushrooms when they begin to come into season in July in Italy. However, dried porcini (or indeed any other mushroom) is fine.'' 

''Unfortunately an awful lot of pretentious b****ocks is written by highfalutin chefs on how to cook risotto, but being originally a peasant's dish it's dead easy, and very tasty !!''

== Ingredients ==

* '''''Arborio, Viale Nano''''' or '''''Carnaroli''''' risotto rice, enough for your guests
* 25[[Cookbook:Gram|g]] salted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* 1 small white [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Liter|litre]] of [[Cookbook:Stock|chicken stock]] (fresh if possible, or from a good quality [[Cookbook:Bouillon Cubes|cube]])
* 200g of porcini [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]], fresh or dried
* a small bunch of flat-leaved [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]]
* 1 cupful of white, dry [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]]
* 100 g freshly grated [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan Reggiano cheese]]
* optional: 1 large [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] clove, crushed 

== Procedure ==

# Soak the mushrooms for at least 20 minutes in 200 [[Cookbook:ML|ml]] of warm water. If the instructions on the packet say they should be soaked for less time, ignore them. Once they have reconstituted properly, chop about ½ of them into small pieces and roughly chop the rest. 
# Melt half the butter in preferably a medium sized frying pan, or saucepan, on a medium heat.
# Chop the onion very finely and &quot;sweat&quot; in the butter until they turn translucent. ''Under no circumstances should they burn. If they do burn, have a good swear and chuck them away. Start over !''
# Now add the rice and swirl it around in the pan until it is also coated in the butter. Leave for about 30 seconds. Again it should not even come close to burning.
# Now splash in the wine - it should fizz and steam dramatically - and wait for it to evaporate.
# Add about half the stock (''Forget this nonsense of adding it one ladle at a time! It invites trouble by risking the rice &quot;catching&quot; and burning whilst you are off doing something else, and makes no discernible difference whatsoever to the taste!)''
# Stir the rice about every 2 minutes to release the starch and add more stock if there is the slightest chance of the rice drying out.
# After about 5 minutes of cooking add the Mushrooms and their juice (or ''liquor'' as it is called)
#:The secret of Risotto is that the rice should be cooked to a point the Italians call ''al dente'' - which means the rice should have a bit of bite left, rather than be squashy and flaccid. This takes anywhere between 15 and 20 minutes, but be sure to start testing small spoonfuls after about 15 minutes cooking.
#:The rice should be fairly glutinous and no TOO runny. Ideally is should spread out on its own across the plate when served, not remaining in a lump in the middle.  
# When you feel the rice is cooked, take it off the heat and add the chopped parsley, the remaining butter and about 2 Tbsp of the Parmesan cheese and mix it all in together. Adjust the seasoning as well. The Italians call this ''The Mantecatura period'' !
# Now let it stand for about 2 minutes and serve. 

''Personally (and many will disagree) I feel this is a dish that stands best on its own, and should not be served with anything other than a green salad or maybe a cold Green Bean Salad.''

==Notes, tips and variations==
* A good indication is a large CUPFUL of rice per person - although that makes TWO cupfuls of cooked rice, which is a lot of rice to eat ''without'' adding mushrooms, onion, cheese and a nibble of salad!
* Dried porcini mushrooms are almost better than fresh, as they flavour the water they are being reconstituted in with a wonderful mushroom flavour which adds to the taste !
* People have differing views on adding garlic. Mushrooms and garlic ARE a nice combination, but the garlic should never overpower the taste of the mushrooms.

[[Image:Pesto being processed.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Pesto in a [[Cookbook:Food Processor|food processor]]]]

'''Pesto''' is a sauce which is added mainly, but by no means exclusively to [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]]. Pesto is purely the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian]] version of this delicious sauce, with other names for the same (or similar) sauce from other countries. Another famous national variant to pesto is ''pistou'', which is the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|French]] equivalent.

{{see also|Cookbook:Pesto}}

== Ingredients ==

* the best quality [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]] you can find. I believe that Greek olive oil is actually better for this recipe than either French or Italian as it has a stronger taste.
* a packet of either [[Cookbook:Pine Nut|pine nuts]] or [[Cookbook:Walnut|walnuts]] (pine nuts give the pesto a blander flavour, walnuts a more robust flavour)
* at least 2 large plants of fresh [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]]
* 7 [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] cloves
* freshly grated [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan cheese]] (not Pecorino please)

== Procedure ==

# Whatever you may have been told, use a electric [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]] or a liquidiser to make pesto. Faffing about with a [[Cookbook:Mortar and Pestle|pestle and mortar]] is for the birds !!
# Again, whatever you have been told, put a good quantity of olive oil in the blender ''first'' and start it running, otherwise the blades will gum up and you risk burning the basil.
# Drop basil leaves through the top into the olive oil so that they are mulched up by the blades.
# Add some pine nuts (or walnuts) so they are also mulched up.
# When the developing Pesto sticks and becomes too thick, simply add more olive oil until the whole lot starts to mulch again. Continue adding basil leaves, pine nuts (walnuts) and the garlic cloves, always making sure the mixture remains fluid.
# Once you begin to run out of basil leaves and nuts add a handful of Parmesan cheese (though not too much; remember the taste should be predominantly of basil).

The end result should be a wondrous smelling, glutinous mass of green which should be then emptied out of the blender into its own container.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* If you like your pesto a little rough, add a small extra quantity of pine nuts and some grated Parmesan cheese to the finished pesto and mix in well. You're ready to go.
* Fresh pesto can be stirred into pasta (penne in my opinion being the best), added as a topping to crostini, or eaten, with eyes closed and a smile on your face, off a spoon, entirely on its own.
*

''I first had calzone in Spilimbergo, Italy on a military deployment. It was the freshest and most amazing pizza I'd ever eaten. When I got back to the States, I found it in a mall pizza restaurant...and it was like a ROCK! Turned out it was batch made, and sat for several hours until I ordered it, and was just sitting there drying out until they baked it for me.''

'''Tortilla Soup''' is a traditional southwestern dish and an excellent way to finish tortillas that have begun to go stale. It works well as a soup before a meal or as the meal itself. Turkey or pork may be used in place of chicken. Alternative garnishes, such as avocado and green onions, also work well.

==Ingredients==

* 3 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]] (optional)
* 1 [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], chopped
* 1 clove [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], minced
* 1 15 ounce can of diced [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
* 6 cups chicken stock, [[Cookbook:Broth|broth]], or bullion
* 1 tablespoon chopped fresh [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]] or 1 teaspoon dried cilantro
* 2-3 pieces of boneless, skinless [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]], raw or frozen
* ½ tsp [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] (optional)
* ½ teaspoon freshly ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Jalapeno|jalapeno]], seeded and diced, or ½ teaspoon dried [[Cookbook: Cayenne pepper|cayenne pepper]] (optional, Tabasco sauce can be added to individual bowls to adjust heat to taste)
* crunchy [[Cookbook:Tortilla|tortillas]] or [[Cookbook:Tortilla Chip|tortilla chips]]
* grated [[Cookbook:Monterey Jack Cheese|Monterey Jack]] or other Mexican cheeses
* sliced [[Cookbook:Olive|black olives]]

==Slow Cooker Procedure==
# Place oil, chopped onion, minced garlic, tomatoes, cilantro, chicken, stock, salt, pepper, and jalapeno/red pepper in the crock pot and cook on low for 6-9 hours.
# When chicken is cooked, remove from soup, finely chop, and return to soup.
# Serve soup in individual bowls with chips, cheese and olives to garnish.

==Alternate Procedure==
# Soup can be made without crock pot/slow cooker on stove. Simply sauté the onion and garlic in olive oil prior to adding other ingredients. Simmer on medium heat until chicken is cooked thoroughly and otherwise follow slow cooker directions.

'''Asparagus with Sesame Seeds and Soy Sauce''' pairs very well with grilled beef, lamb or salmon.  It can also be served chilled as part of a brunch menu.  Asparagus is high in folic acid and fibre.  Using organic ingredients enhances taste, health and the environment.

Serves 4.

==Ingredients==
*20 to 32 [[Cookbook:Asparagus|asparagus]] spears, preferably thin
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbsp]] (30 [[Cookbook:ML|ml]]) [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]] 
*1 tbsp (15 ml) sesame seed oil
*2 tbsp (30 ml) [[Cookbook:Sesame Seed|sesame seed]] (If available, use Gomasio instead, and omit the salt. (see tips below))
*Kosher [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

==Equipment==
*Steaming pot, bamboo steamer or asparagus steamer

==Procedure==
#Prepare steamer and bring water to a boil.
#Trim asparagus spears in half, discarding (or composting) the thicker ends.
#Steam the asparagus for 8-10 minutes, until tender, but still crisp.
#Heat a small skillet or frying pan on medium heat. Add the sesame seeds and shake or stir.  They are done when they just begin to darken and give off a pleasant toasted aroma.  Be careful not to leave unattended as they can easily burn.
#Remove asparagus from steamer, shake to drain water, and arrange on serving plate.
#Drizzle the soy sauce and the sesame oil over the asparagus.
#Sprinkle with the sesame seeds and give a very light sprinkle with the Kosher salt.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
One way to gauge the best place to cut an asparagus spear is to gently grasp each end and bend the spear.  The point at which is begins to break is where the stem begins to become tougher.

Gomasio is a Japanese seasoning made with sesame seeds and salt.  I obtain mine at a local health food store.  It can also be spelled Gomashio.

'''Hamburger Deluxe''' turns a hamburger into a whole new experience.  This recipe evolved over a couple of decades with ingredients being added or deleted as tastes changed.  Using organic ingredients enhances taste, health and the environment. 

Serves 4.

==Ingredients==
;For the Hamburgers:
*¾ [[Cookbook:Pound|lb]].  (350 [[Cookbook:Gram|g]]) lean ground beef
*¼ lb. (110 g) ground lamb 
*1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
*½ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (125 ml) [[Cookbook:Oat|rolled oats]]
*2 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], [[Cookbook:Mincing|minced]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] (15 [[Cookbook:ML|ml]]) [[Cookbook:Grape Seed Oil|grapeseed oil]] (or other lightly flavoured [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]])
*1 tablespoon (15 ml) [[Cookbook:Dijon Mustard|Dijon mustard]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] (5 g) ground cumin
*½ teaspoon (2 ml) [[Cookbook:Worcestershire Sauce|Worcestershire Sauce]]
*1 tablespoon (15 ml) chipotle BBQ Sauce, or a healthy pinch of [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chipotle powder]]
*½ teaspoon (2-3 g) Kosher [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

;For the topping:
*[[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]], smoked [[Cookbook:Cheddar Cheese|cheddar]] is best, but any cheddar or your favourite cheese will do
*[[Cookbook:Sour Cream|Sour cream]]
*plain [[Cookbook:Cream Cheese|cream cheese]], sliced thinly
*1 Vidalia [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], coarsely chopped (Spanish onion will do)
*¼ pound (110 g) button [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]], sliced thin 
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* fresh ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]] to taste
*favourite hamburger condiments
*4 [[Cookbook:Bun|hamburger buns]]

==Equipment==
*barbecue

==Procedure==
#Sauté onions and mushrooms in butter until lightly brown, set aside.
#Mix all of the Hamburger ingredients together until well mixed, and let rest for 15 minutes.
#Heat BBQ to medium-high.
#Divide hamburger mix into 4 equal balls.
#Form patties by slapping the burgers back and forth from one palm to the other until they are about an inch thick (this technique is displayed in the film: Return of the Seacaucus Seven!)
#Grill burgers to desired doneness, turning every few minutes and adding cheese after the last flipping of the burgers
#Serve on the buns, with the onion/mushroom mixture, a dollop of sour cream, and a thin slice of cream cheese.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
* The suggestion to flip the meat a number of times comes from a book concerning the science of cooking, which I cannot remember the title of at time of writing.  The theory, however, is that the juices in meat rise to the surface of the meat and are then lost during grilling.  By turning the meat regularly, you reduce the capacity of the juices to rise out of, and run off, the meat.
* The egg and oats combine to bind the hamburgers and help prevent them from falling apart on the grill.

'''Maple-Syrup Planked Salmon''' mixes the hint of sweetness from the maple syrup with the rich smoky flavour imparted from the cedar plank. Using organic ingredients enhances taste, health and the environment.

Serves 4.

==Ingredients==
*4 salmon steaks or individual fillets (preferably wild caught) 
*4 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbsp]] (60 [[Cookbook:ML|ml]]) fresh [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]] (2 for the marinade and 2 for the sauce) 
*2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] (10 ml) pure [[Cookbook:Maple Syrup|maple syrup]]
*2 tbsp (30 ml) [[Cookbook:Grape Seed Oil|grapeseed oil]] (or other clean tasting and light-flavoured [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]) 
*1½ tsp (7 [[Cookbook:Gram|g]]) [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chipotle powder]] (chipotle barbecue sauce may be substituted for this) 
*1 tsp (5 g) crushed dried [[Cookbook:Rosemary|rosemary]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Green onion|scallions]], thinly sliced for garnish 
*Kosher [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

==Equipment==
*Cedar plank(s) large enough to hold salmon without crowding (these must be untreated cedar planks with no preservatives or chemicals) 
*Barbecue
*Spray bottle for controlling flare-ups

==Procedure==
#Completely immerse cedar planks in water for several hours or overnight.
#Heat barbecue to medium-high.
#Mix 2 tablespoons (30 ml) lemon juice, the oil, rosemary, maple syrup and half of the chipotle powder in a small bowl.  Coat the Salmon with the mixture and let rest at room temperature for 20 minutes.
#Mix the remaining lemon juice with the remaining chipotle powder with a fork and set aside as a garnish.
#Place plank(s) on grill and close lid.  Allow plank to heat for a couple minutes.
#Lightly sprinkle Kosher salt on plank(s).
#Put Salmon on plank, keeping fish at least an inch from the edge of the plank (in the case of fillets, place skin-side down).  Reduce heat to low and close lid.
#Grill for roughly 15 minutes until desired doneness reached without turning or moving Salmon.  Generally, salmon should be cooked until the flesh loses its transparency and the meat can easily be broken with a fork.
#Spray water to douse any flames that light on the sides of the plank.
#When cooked, place the Salmon on a serving platter and sprinkle with the scallions.
#Immerse the cedar plank in water as a safety precaution.
#Serve the Salmon with the optional lemon juice/chipotle sauce.

'''Tarhana Çorbası''' is a Turkish soup made from a [[Cookbook:Fermentation|fermented]] and dehydrated mix of flour, yogurt, onions, tomatoes and green peppers. The exact composition of ''tarhana'' differs from region to region in Turkey. 

==Ingredients==
===for the Tarhana===
*3 [[Cookbook:Tomato|ripe tomatoes]]
*3 [[Cookbook:Green Pepper|green peppers]]
*3 [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] / 500 [[Cookbook:ML|ml]] [[Cookbook:Yogurt|live yogurt]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp.]] [[Cookbook:Yeast|dried active yeast]]
*½ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Water|tepid water]] (ca. [[Cookbook:Oven temperatures|100ºF / 40ºC]])
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*⅛ tsp. [[Cookbook:Cayenne pepper|cayenne pepper]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*[[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]

===for the Soup===
*1 cup  dry tarhana mix
*7 - 8 cups [[Cookbook:Stock|meat stock]]
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Tomato paste|tomato paste]]

==Procedure==
*Always follow all [[w:en:Food safety|FOOD SAFETY]] precautions when preparing food.
&lt;br&gt;
# Dissolve the sugar in the tepid water and sprinkle the dried yeast on top.  Allow to soften 5 minutes or so and stir.
# Blanche, peel and seed the tomatoes. Peel, dice and roughly chop the onions. Remove the stem, seeds and membrane from the green peppers and cut roughly.
# In a blender or food processor, purée the tomatoes, onion, green pepper and yogurt in batches.
# Combine all the ingredients except the flour and mix well.  Gradually add enough flour to make a stiff dough.  Knead for 5 to 10 minutes until smooth and elastic then place in a large non-reactive bowl and cover with waxed paper (don't use plastic wrap). Let stand at room temperature for 10 to 12 days.  Punch down the dough once a day.  If the dough becomes watery, knead in some more flour.  Let stand until the dough no longer rises and has lost its stretch.  Rub the dough between your hands onto a tray covered with parchment paper so that it forms small pieces.  Cover the tray with cheesecloth or other protective mesh and leave to dry in a cool, well ventilated place.  As it dries, break the dough into smaller pieces eventually crumbling it as small as you can.  When it is completely dry (a week or more) pulverize in a blender, a little at a time.  Store in freezer bags or large jars.  Store in a cool place or refrigerate. May be kept up to twelve months.
# To make tarhana soup, mix 1 cup of the dried dough mix with 3 cups of water or meat stock. Mix with a wooden spoon until softened.  Add more water or stock to make a thickish soup with a creamy consistency. Add 2 tablespoons of tomato paste and cook for 15 to 20 minutes.  Pour into bowls and garnish with croutons, parsley, or paprika-infused butter or olive oil, if desired. Serve with Turkish bread or a crisp baguette.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* Do not use pasteurized yogurt. The live yogurt culture helps prevent contamination by harmful organisms.
* The yogurt and yeast may be replaced with 1 pint of [[Cookbook:Kefir|kefir]], which supplies both the bacteria and yeasts for the fermentation. Some traditional recipes for tarhana refer to kefir as &quot;soured milk&quot;.
* All utensils, and containers should be sterilized with boiling water before use. Wash your hands each time before handling the dough directly.

'''Tomato Paste''' is a basic ingredient used in innumerable dishes in the cuisines of many countries.  It is prepared by reducing tomato purée on low heat for several hours.  While commercially produced tomato paste is the usual source, it can be prepared at home by the following method.

==Ingredients==

*1 gallon / 1.5 litres [[Cookbook:Tomato Concassé|tomato pulp]]
*1 cup sweet red [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|peppers]], chopped
*1½ teaspoons [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

==Procedure==
&lt;br&gt;
*Always follow all [[w:en:Food safety|FOOD SAFETY]] precautions when preparing food.
&lt;br&gt;
# Cook the ingredients over low heat in a large wide covered stockpot for an hour. 
# Pass the mixture through a food mill several times starting with the coarsest grid and progressing to the finest&lt;ref&gt;''This will actually be faster than trying to force it through a fine sieve in a single pass.''&lt;/ref&gt;
# Return the pot to the stove and heat uncovered over very low heat for 3 hours or more until very thick, stirring frequently to avoid burning.
# Pour into new sterilized ½-pint preserving jars&lt;ref&gt;''Always check well for chips or cracks and discard if found.''&lt;/ref&gt; leaving ¼-inch of space at the top. Cover with new seals and screw on the lids securely but not too tightly. Process in a boiling water bath for 45 minutes. Remove from the water bath with tongs and allow to cool on an inverted oven rack for 12 hours. Test the seal by pressing the centre of each lid with your forefinger.  If the inner lid does not move, remove the outer ring.  Store in a cool, dry, dark place.

This northern Italian meat sauce, or Ragu Bolognese is wonderful on [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]] with freshly grated [[Cookbook:Cheese|Parmesan cheese]], or as filling for lasagne. Using organic ingredients enhances taste, health and the environment.

==Ingredients==
*¼ [[Cookbook:Pound|lb]] (125 [[Cookbook:Gram|g]]) [[Cookbook:Ham|ham]], cut into cubes
*1 lb. (450 g) [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] lean or medium ground 
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] (15 [[Cookbook:ML|ml]]) [[Cookbook:Olive oil|olive oil]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (225 ml) coarsely chopped [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*¼ cup (50 ml) coarsely chopped [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]]
*¼ cup (50 ml) coarsely chopped [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]]
*¼ cup (50 ml) coarsely chopped [[Cookbook:Fennel|fennel]] bulb, if available
*¼ cup (50 ml) [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] 
*1 cup (225 ml) canned plum [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]]
*½ cup (125 ml) dry white [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]]
*2 cups (500 ml) beef stock (preferably fresh, but canned beef stock will do)
*¼ cup (50 ml) [[Cookbook:Tomato paste|tomato paste]]
*1 lb. (450 g) spaghetti pasta, preferably made from durum wheat
*1 cup Parmesan cheese for garnish, preferably freshly grated Reggiano Parmesan 
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and fresh ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste

==Procedure==
#Mix the coarsely chopped onion, carrot, celery and fennel (optional) together and finely chop them (this is called a battuto in Italian, or a finely chopped mixture of vegetables and herbs to flavour a dish)
#Melt the butter in a heavy saucepan or skillet over medium-high heat and add the battuto
#Cook, stirring occasionally until very lightly browned
#Add this mixture to a heavy pot 
#Heat the olive oil in the skillet the battuto was browned in and when the oil is hot, add the beef and stir to break up lumps, cooking until well browned
#Add to the battuto in the pot
#Add the wine to the skillet the beef was in and stir on high heat, scraping any brown bits stuck to the pan
#Add the tomato paste and stock and stir until well mixed and add this mixture to the pot
#Drain and coarsely chop the plum tomatoes and add them to the pot
#Bring the pot to a boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer, with bubbles barely breaking the surface
#Simmer, stirring occasionally for an hour (or more), until thick
#Add pepper to taste, and salt if necessary to taste
#When the sauce is ready, bring a gallon (4 litres) of water to a full boil over high heat in a large pot
#Add the pasta, give it a brisk stir to ensure it is all covered by water and not clumped together.  Cook for about 10-12 minutes, or until [[Cookbook:al dente|al dente]] (firm but not hard, there should still be a bit of 'bite' when chewing pasta, rather than soggy and mushy)
#Drain the pasta well and serve immediately
#Spoon the Bolognese sauce over the pasta and have guests garnish with the grated Parmesan cheese.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
* This is a great recipe for making in large quantities and freezing.  I have made up to 20 times the recipe and frozen in four-cup (1 litre) servings for our family so we can enjoy the pasta sauce over and over without having to start from scratch each time.  If making bulk recipes, be sure to simmer for hours, or even a full day, occasionally stirring up from the bottom of the large pot to ensure the contents at the bottom does not burn, adding stock as needed to keep the right consistency.  The goal is to have the flavours mix and make the home smell delicious!
*Never rinse pasta with water.  To ensure there is no excess starch from the pasta, choose a high quality durum wheat pasta and boil it in lots of water.

# (optional) just before serving, spoon a teaspoon of sour cream in to the middle of the bowl

==Notes, tips, and variations==
This recipe is surprisingly flavorful for being prepared form preserved ingredients.  With a dollop of sour cream for garnish, it is even better.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Börek''' is a general term in Turkish cuisine that applies to a family of pastries with about fifty different members.  They have in common the fact that they are all pastry layers of some type enclosing a filling. There are two basic methods, one consists of rolling out very thin sheets of dough, called [[w:en:yufka|yufka]] in Turkish and [[w:en:phyllo|phyllo]] in Greek.  The other main type of börek uses a dough very similar to ''[[Cookbook:Puff pastry|pâte feuilletée]]'' in which the dough is layered with butter, folded, and rolled out several times, called ''[[w:en:nemse börek|nemse börek]]'' in Turkish.&lt;ref&gt;Algar, Ayla Esen (1985) ''The Complete Book of Turkish Cooking'' ISBN 0-710-30334-3&lt;/ref&gt;

The following recipe describes the procedure required to prepare triangular shaped börek from commercially produced phyllo.  Links to recipes for fillings are listed at the end of the recipe.

==Ingredients==

* 2 cups      prepared filling
* 1 box      yufka/phyllo pastry sheets&lt;ref&gt;Available from Turkish, Greek, Armenian and Middle-Eastern grocers, among others, as well as some supermarkets.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Melted butter or high quality vegetable oil.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. peanut, hazelnut, walnut, almond, grapeseed. Avoid anything with a greasy taste such as corn oil.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==
&lt;br&gt;
*Always follow all [[w:en:Food safety|FOOD SAFETY]] precautions when preparing food.
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Wrapping börek.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|Making börek triangles.]]
#Remove the  phyllo sheets from the container. Unfold carefully so as not to break them. Lay them flat and cover with a clean, damp tea towel to prevent them from drying out.  This is important.
# Working quickly, cut the phyllo into lengthwise thirds. (Step 1. in the diagram.) Lay one of these out and cover the other two with the damp tea towel.
# Brush the strip of phyllo with the melted butter.  Place a heaped teaspoonful of filling on one end of the strip. (Step 2. in the diagram.)
#Fold the right lower corner upward over the filling to form a triangle. (Step 3. in the diagram.)
#Now fold the right upper corner over to the left (Step 4. in the diagram.)
#Continue folding in this manner until you reach the end of the strip.
#Trim of any excess dough and seal the edges by rubbing a damp finger over the dough and pressing the edge of the triangle where the strip ends.
#Fry in oil at [[Cookbook:Oven temperatures|340ºF]] until golden brown or bake at 350ºF for 15 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Prewrapped, uncooked börek freezes well. To cook, bake at 325ºF for 30 minutes.  Do not deep-fry frozen foods.  Splattering oil can cause burns and fires.  You may sautée them in a covered pan 2 or 3 at a time.  Hold the cover in front of your face as you place each börek in the pan.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fillings===
*[[Cookbook:Peynirli Börek|Peynirli Börek]] - White cheese filling
*[[Cookbook:Kıymalı Börek|Kıymalı Börek]] - Minced meat filling
*[[Cookbook:Tavuklu Börek|Tavuklu Börek]] - Chicken filling
*[[Cookbook:Ispanaklı Börek|Ispanaklı Börek]] - Spinach filling

Formal or informal, '''Spinach Artichoke Dip''' is a great appetizer at any party. It is quick and easy taking very little time to prepare. The dip may be served with a variety or crackers, breads, or chips. 

==Ingredients==
* 16 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounces]] (450g) [[Cookbook:Cream Cheese|cream cheese]]
* 3/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (180ml) heavy [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]] (use half milk, if desired) 
*1/3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (80ml) grated [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan cheese]] 
*1/4 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] (60ml) [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic powder]] 
* 16 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounces]] (450g) frozen cut leaf [[Cookbook:spinach|spinach]], thawed and well drained 
* 1 can quartered [[Cookbook:artichoke|artichoke hearts]], rinsed and well drained 
*2/3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (160ml) shredded [[Cookbook:Monterey Jack Cheese|Monterey Jack cheese]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] prepared (240ml) [[Cookbook:salsa|salsa]] 
* [[Cookbook:Crackers|Crackers]] or [[Cookbook:tortilla chips|tortilla chips]], for serving

==Procedure==
#In a food processor fitted with a metal blade, process the cream cheese, cream, Parmesan cheese, and garlic powder until smooth and creamy. Add the spinach and process until thoroughly mixed. Add the artichokes and process just until coarsely chopped.
#Turn the mixture into a 3 1/2-quart electric slow cooker; smooth the top.
#Cover and cook on the high heat setting 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hours, until hot in the center. Sprinkle the top evenly with the Jack cheese and spoon the salsa in a ring around the inside edges of the slow cooker. Cover and continue heating on high 15 minutes longer, or until the cheese is melted. Reduce the heat to the low setting and serve warm with crackers or tortilla chips for dipping. Refrigerate any leftovers.

==Notes, tips and variations==
*Best served if hot but may also be served chilled. 
*If served in a bread bowl, pieces may be broken off and used as dipping tools for further enjoyment. 
*Other condiments that go great with this dip include sides of salsa, guacamole, or sour cream. 
*This is great appetizer for vegetarians and vegan cream cheese may be substituted if need be.

'''Bara brith''', sometimes known as &quot;speckled bread&quot; (the literal meaning of the original Welsh-language name), is a fruit bread which originated in [[Cookbook:Welsh cuisine|Wales]]. It is traditionally made with [[Cookbook:raisin|raisins]], [[Cookbook:currant|Zante currants]] and [[w:candied peel|candied peel]].

In [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Argentina|Argentina]] bara brith, which was brought to the country by the Welsh settlers who started arriving in [[w:Chubut|Chubut]] province in 1865, is known as ''torta negra'' (&quot;black cake&quot;) and is a traditional food item there.

There are many different recipes for this bread, which is baked and sold commercially in some parts of Wales. The bread has a limited shelf life and is best eaten as soon as possible.

==Ingredients==
To make one loaf.

* 8 fl oz (225 ml) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 2 oz (50 g) [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]], plus 1 teaspoon
* 4 level teaspoons dried [[Cookbook:yeast|yeast]]
* 1 lb (450 g) strong plain [[Cookbook:flour|flour]]
* 1 level teaspoon [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
* 3 oz (75 g) [[Cookbook:butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:margarine|margarine]]
* 1 level teaspoon [[Cookbook:Mixed Spice|mixed spice]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:egg|egg]], beaten
* 12 oz (350 g) mixed [[Cookbook:Dried Fruit|dried fruit]]
* clear [[Cookbook:honey|honey]], to [[Cookbook:Glazing|glaze]]
* 2 lb (900 g) [[Cookbook:loaf tin|loaf tin]], well greased

==Procedure==
# Warm the milk in a small pan until hand-hot. Put it into a bowl with 1 teaspoon of sugar and the yeast. Leave it in a warm place for about 15 minutes until a froth appears. 
# Sift the flour and place in a large bowl with 2 oz (50g) sugar and the salt. Rub the fat into the flour until it resembles fine breadcrumbs then stir in the mixed spice. Add the egg and frothed yeast. Mix to a dough in the bowl before turning it out onto a floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic. Place back into a bowl and cover with plastic film or a damp cloth. Leave it to rise in a warm place for about 90 minutes.
# After it has been left to stand 'knock down' the dough and knead again, adding the fruit slowly. Place into a bread tin and put the tin into an oiled plastic bag. Leave to rise for about 35 to 40 minutes and pre-heat the oven to [[Cookbook:Oven temperatures|gas mark 5]], 190°C (375°F).
# When the dough has risen and springs back when pressed take the tin out of the bag and bake in the centre of the oven for about 30 minutes. Cover the top of the loaf tin with aluminium foil to stop burning and bake for another 30 minutes. Take out of the oven and tap the bottom of the loaf, which should sound hollow, if not bake it for another 5 minutes. Brush the honey onto the top of the loaf and cool it on a wire rack. Slice it thinly and serve buttered.

This recipe is taken from Delia Smith’s Complete Cookery Course and Delia Smith's Illustrated Complete Cookery Course

In Wales the fruit is traditionally soaked overnight in cold tea.

==A simpler variant without yeast==
This variation is also popular - and uses baking powder and bicarbonate of soda as raising agents, rather than yeast. As above, soaking of the dried fruit in tea, for several hours, is essential to the taste and succulence of the loaf.

===Ingredients===
* 12-14oz brown or wholemeal flour
* 3-4oz brown sugar
* 4 oz dried fruit (soaked in [[Cookbook:Tea|black tea]])
* 1 teaspoon mixed spice
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* ½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|bicarbonate of soda]]
* 1 egg
* optional - glace cherries

===Procedure===
# soak fruit in tea for several hours. Retain fruit AND tea. 
# mix flour, sugar, spice, baking powder and bicarb. 
# strain dried fruit and add to dry ingredients and start to mix. 
# add egg, and mix. 
# add black tea in small amounts mixing as you go. 
# continue to add until the mixture is thick, but runny - i.e it clings to a spoon, but any excess drops off easily (if you have used up all your tea, a drop of milk can be added instead to achieve this consistency). 
# the addition of chopped glace cherries will further increase the moisture of the bara brith.
# Pour into a greased baking tin, and bake at 190°C for approximately 90 mins. Loosely cover the top for the first hour, to avoid burning. Once cooked, turn out and cool

Serve sliced with butter and a [[Cookbook:A Nice Cup of Tea|cup of tea]].

=Summer S'Mores=

===Ingredients===

* 1 [[Cookbook:Graham Cracker|graham cracker]] (full size, or 2 halves)
* 1 4-[[Cookbook:Ounce|ounce]] [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate bar]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Marshmallow|marshmallows]]

===Directions===

# On a sunny day, park car in direct sunlight. A parking lot is especially good.
# In a jiffy, the temperature inside the car will be as high as [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|140°F]] or 60°C.
# Place a graham cracker on a plate on the dashboard, put the chocolate bar on top of the graham cracker, then a marshmallow in the center of each side.
# Bake in hot car for 10-15 minutes, watching carefully for doneness.
# Now think what is happening when you leave your dog, or worse, your child in the car!


===Warnings===

* I put the digital remote thermometer on the shelf above the instrument panel at lunchtime in my vehicle on this sunny Carolina August day. With an outside temperature of 92°F, in 10 minutes it was 105°, in 20 minutes, 130°, finally hovering between 135° and 139°F after 25 minutes. &lt;br&gt;
Enjoy your S'Mores!

'''Honey's Cheese Enchiladas''' - this cheese enchilada recipe was handed down from my grandmother and mother.  It is definitely Tex-Mex, as my family is from south Texas.  

==Ingredients==
* 1½ pounds grated [[Cookbook:Cheddar Cheese|cheddar cheese]]
* 1 large [[Cookbook:onion|onion]], chopped
* ~20 &lt;u&gt;corn&lt;/u&gt; [[Cookbook:tortilla|tortillas]]

For the '''chili gravy''':

* 3 tablespoons (T.) [[Cookbook:flour|flour]]
* 3 T. [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|chili powder]]
* 3 T. [[Cookbook:vegetable oil|vegetable oil]]
* 3 cups of [[Cookbook:water|water]]

==Procedure==

# Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).  You will need at least one 9 inch X 12 inch baking pan. No need to grease it.
# Fry chili powder and flour in oil in a 10&quot; or 12&quot; skillet until emulsified.  Add water, bring to a simmer, and then stir for ~5 minutes until slightly thickened.  Turn down heat to low.
# Soak one tortilla in chili gravy until softened, 20-30 seconds.  Remove tortilla from gravy, place flat on a plate, and add ~1 T. cheese and ~1 T. onion to center of the tortilla.  Roll it up, and place with edges facing down in the baking pan.  Repeat this until you have used all the tortillas.  (If you get low on the gravy at the end, stir in ⅛ - ¼ cup of water.)  Cover the enchiladas with the remaining cheese, onions and chili gravy.
# Heat in oven for about 5 minutes (longer will toughen the cheese).  Serves 5-6.

(These freeze well, but defrost completely before reheating).

In Tex-Mex cuisine, these are often served with [[Mexican Rice]], pinto beans and guacamole salad.</text>

'''Cleve's Cajun Seafood Gumbo'''.

==Ingredients==
&lt;div style=&quot;column-count: 2; -moz-column-count: 2&quot;&gt;
* ¾ cup [[Cookbook:vegetable oil|vegetable oil]]
* ¾ cup [[Cookbook:flour|flour]]
* 10 oz. [[Cookbook:okra|okra]] (optional)
* 2 cups [[Cookbook:onion|onion]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:celery|celery]]
* 1½ cups [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell pepper]]
* 6 cloves [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic]], chopped
* 6 cups [[Cookbook:shrimp|shrimp]] [[Cookbook:stock|stock]] or [[Cookbook:water|water]]
* 8 oz. [[Cookbook:clam|clam]] juice (opt.)
* ½ t. [[Cookbook:oregano|oregano]]
* ½ t. [[Cookbook:thyme|thyme]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaves]]
* 1½ t. [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
* ½ - 1 t. [[Cookbook:cayenne pepper|cayenne pepper]]
* [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]] to taste
* 2 T. [[Cookbook:parsley|parsley]] (fresh)
* 1 lb. Andouille sausage
* 1 lb. shrimp
* ½ pint [[Cookbook:oyster|oysters]] (at least)
* ½ lb. [[Cookbook:crayfish|crawfish]] (opt.)
* 4 chopped [[Cookbook:green onion|green onions]] (as topping)
&lt;/div&gt;

==Procedure==

# For stock, simmer shrimp shells in about 6½ cups of water for 20 minutes.
# In a 6-8quart pot, make roux:  Heat oil, then sprinkle in flour gradually, as you whisk.  Cook flour and oil on medium heat about 20 minutes, to a very dark reddish brown.  Stir constantly, especially towards the end.  (Be gutsy.  The best roux is quite dark, but don’t let it burn.  Dark roux is what makes this gumbo great. )
# Add vegetables to the roux.  Cook 10 minutes (or 15 minutes with okra).  Add cooled stock slowly.
# Add herbs, spices and clam juice.  Simmer 15 minutes, then another 30-40 more with Andouille sausage. Add the seafood at the end, to avoid overcooking.
# Makes about 10 servings.  Top with chopped green onions.  Many like to serve over rice.  Goes great with a baguette or cornbread.

==Note, tips and variations==
* You can add cut-up boneless chicken, or substitute chicken for the oysters, if they’re not your thing.  If you don’t have Andouille sausage, smoked or Polish sausage will do fine.

This recipe has been improved on over the generations. The reason why this is cooked on the stove top &amp; only browned in the oven is that in Greek villages there was a shared village oven. So dishes like these were popular as they could be browned after the bread had been baked.

==Ingredients==

* 2 Tablespoons stale breadcrumbs to top

===Pasta Mix===
* 250g Macaroni pasta.
* 2 eggs whole beaten lightly.
* ¾ cup Grated fresh pamesan cheese. 

===Meat Sauce===
* 2 Tablespoons Olive Oil.
* 2 medium chopped onions.
* 750g Minced Meat (better to do it yourself in the food processor).
* 400&amp;ndash;450g Canned Chopped Tomatoes.
* ⅓ Cup tomato paste.
* ½ Cup water.
* ¼ Cup dry white wine.
* 1 tablespoon beef stock powder.
* ½ teaspoon Cinnamon powder.
* 1 egg beaten lightly.

===Greek style Bechamel sauce===
* 100g Butter.
* ½ cup plain flour.
* 3½ cups milk.
* 1 cup Grated Fresh Parmasen cheese.
* 2 egg yolks.

== Equipment required ==
* 2.5 Litre (10 cup) Baking dish metal/glass/ceramic are fine.
* 2 Large saucepans for Meat sauce &amp; pasta.
* 1 medium to large saucepan for Bechamel sauce.

To avoid a large clean up at the end just reuse the same saucepan.

== Procedure ==

It is a good idea to start your meat sauce first as this needs to cool before you can begin construction.

=== Meat Sauce ===
# Heat 2 tablespoons of Olive Oil in pan.
# Saute 2 chopped onions then,
# Add 750g of Minced meat cook till well browned.
# Add 400&amp;ndash;450g of chopped canned tomatoes liquid &amp; all.
# Add ⅓ cup Tomato Paste.
# Add ½ cup water.
# Add ¼ cup wine.
# Add 1 tablespoon Beef stock powder.
# Add ½ teaspoon cinnamon powder. 
# Simmer uncovered, until it becomes thick in consistency.
# Once thick transfer into a mixing bowl to cool.
# Once cool stir in 1 Lightly beaten egg.

=== Greek Style Bechamel sauce === 
# Melt 100g butter in pan
# Add ½ cup plain flour
# Stir over heat until bubbling. 
# Remove pan from heat.
# Gradually add 3½ cups milk - (Please note mixture will become thick &amp; then will thin again).
# Return pan to heat until sauce bubbles then thickens. 
# Stir in 1 cup parmesan cheese.
# Transfer to mixing bowl.
# Cool slightly. 
# Mix in 2 egg yolks.

=== Pasta Mix === 
# Cook 250 g Macaroni pasta as per directions on packet until tender.
# Drain pasta.
# Transfer Pasta to Mixing Bowl
# Mix Pasta while hot with
# ¾ cup parmesan cheese and,
# 2 eggs which are lightly beaten.

=== Construction === 
# Grease baking dish.
# Press pasta mix into base of pan.
# Top pasta mix with the Meat sauce.
# Pour over the Greek Style Bechamel Sauce over the Meat sauce (smooth the top).
# Sprinkle 2 tablespoons Stale Breadcrumbs over the top.

In preheated oven- Bake at 180 Degrees Celsius / 350 Degrees Farenheit for  1 hour till golden brown.

Stand for at least 10 mins before serving.

Leftovers freeze well so it is a great freezer cooking dish.

'''Lemon pickle''' is a traditional condiment used with [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] food. Many pickle recipes from India have oil to help preserve the pickle, but this recipe uses no oil.

{{see also|Cookbook:Lemon Pickle 2}}

==Ingredients==

* [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemons]] - 12 small or 6 large (thin skins preferred)
* [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|juice]] of 1 large or 2 small lemons
* ½ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* ¼ cup of [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|red chili powder]]
* ½ cup of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 3 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]] powder
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Fenugreek|fenugreek]] seed
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Mustard|black mustard]] seed
* ¼ tsp [[Cookbook:Asafoetida|asafoetida]] powder (omit for [[Cookbook:Gluten-Free|gluten-free]] version)

==Procedure==

;Preparation
# Wash the lemons and dry them well, leaving no water on the lemons. Trim off the stalk and any odd bits.
# Cut the lemons in to small pieces about 2 cm / ¾ inch on each side, and place in a bowl.
# Dry-roast the fenugreek, black mustard and asafoetida together in a pan on a medium heat for about 5 minutes. Don't burn them!
# Grind the roasted spices in a grinder, or a [[Cookbook:Mortar and Pestle|mortar and pestle]].
# Add the ground spices, turmeric powder, salt, sugar and chili powder to the bowl and mix together well.
# Pack the mixture into a 2 [[Cookbook:Liter|litre]] (2 [[Cookbook:Quart|quart]]) jar, or use a couple of smaller jars. Don't fill quite to the top - allow at least 1 cm space.

;Fermentation
Sit the jar where it will get the heat of the sun. Bring the jar inside in the evening, and put it back out in the morning. Do this for at least a month in summer, two months in winter. The warmth of the sun will help the pickle to ferment.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* Don't worry about the amount of sugar in the recipe, because it will be fermented away over time.
* Asafoetida powder generally has wheat flour added to it, to help it flow well. You can omit this ingredient if you want to make it gluten-free.

}}{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Spain|Cuisine of Spain]]



The original '''Paella''' was a poor man's fare, which is why it is made with a little of everything one may have on hand in the kitchen. &quot;Paella&quot; is the name for [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]] in [[Wikipedia:Valencian|Valencian]], although as popularity for this dish spread throughout Spain, the pan has come to be known as the ''paellera''.

'''Paella''' is a typical dish from the [[Wikipedia:Valencian_Community|Valencia Region]]. This recipe is for the traditional Paella Valenciana, which is where the dish was first created.  But many different varieties of paella are enjoyed. For example, in some regions of Valencia paella is cooked using more seafood such as shrimp, mussels and clams. 

This recipe is an excellent and restaurant-grade version of the traditional paella, which I discovered on the net and it's the only version I cook. I don't have the link to the page where I found the recipe, but I do know that the person who wrote it was taught it by a Spanish chef from the heart of Valencia, the home of this wonderful dish.














==Important==

The key to a good Paella relies on two pillars. 


1. '''The rice should be medium grain.'''

Spanish rice is rounded and short; it absorbs liquid very well, and it stays relatively firm during cooking. Those qualities make it ideal for paella, where the rice grains absorb flavor from the liquid; the rice should be dry and separate when done, not creamy like risotto. The most appreciated variety of Spanish rice is bomba, which is widely available in the U.K and from the internet. Arborio is an acceptable substitute; long-grain rices, however, are not.


2. '''A true Paella pan.'''

A true paella pan is wide, round, and shallow and has splayed sides. It has two looped handles and may dip slightly in the middle so the oil can pool there for any preliminary sautéing. The shape of the pan, which is called either a paella or paellera (pah-ay-yair-ah), helps to ensure that the rice cooks in a thin layer. The [[Wikipedia:Valencian|Valencian]]s say that the cooked rice should be only as thick as un ditet, or the width of a small finger (about 1/2 inch). The key is to maximize the amount of rice touching the bottom of the pan because, as you'll see, that's where the flavor lives. For that reason, paella pans grow in diameter rather than in height. A 14-inch paella pan with un ditet of rice serves two to four people; an 18-inch pan serves six to eight.

A good paella pan is made of a very thin, conductive metal, usually plain or enameled steel. I've recently seen quite a few objects masquerading as paella pans. For example, those beautiful heavy and expensive copper or stainless-steel pans that some stores market as paella pans are actually better suited to braising than to making paella. And any pan that's sold with a lid is a dead-giveaway impostor: except for the final resting period, paella is cooked uncovered. Paella pans are best ordered online or from a good catering store. I ordered mine online from Valencia and it was pretty cheap, about £10. Please see the links below for places where you can buy them along with rice stockists.

If however you don't have a paella pan, the alternative is to use a skillet. A 13-inch or larger stainless-steel or aluminum skillet will work; otherwise, use two medium skillets (which is a little trickier logistically), dividing the ingredients between them. Avoid cast-iron skillets (they retain too much heat) and nonstick pans (they produce bland paellas).

==Ingredients==

* A good paella pan that serves about 2 to 3 people (I use a traditional polished steel one)
* [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|Olive Oil]]
* 250[[Cookbook:g|g]] of [[Cookbook:Clam|Clam]]s
* 10 to 12 [[Cookbook:Mussels|Mussels]]
* 250g of small cooked [[Cookbook:Prawns|Prawns]]
* 250g of Calamari or [[Cookbook:Squid|Squid]] cut into rings
* 4 to 6 large [[Cookbook:Prawns|Prawns]]

==Method==

This recipe is done in 3 stages:
The most important part of this recipe is stage 1, the stock. It's important to get the amount of water for the stock right as this will impair the flavour if too much is used. The general method is 1 cup of water for every half a cup of rice &quot;plus a bit&quot;. As we are serving 2 people and hence using 1 cup of rice, we use 2 cups of water &quot;plus a bit&quot;, so about 2 &amp; a half/3 cups of water, no more! 


==Stage 1 - Stock==

The base of this stock is the clams and prawns, but you can use a (fresh) fish stock if you like. However this stock is so good you literally can drink it once it's ready, it's that good. Try it! 

Peel the small prawns removing the shells and heads and place in a bowl, reserve the prawn meat until stage 3. Gently tap the mussels and discard any that don't close. Clean the mussels and remove the beards and scrape off any barnicles, put half of the mussels aside until stage 3. 

Pour the measured water into a heavy pot and throw in the mussels and clams and bring to the boil. Gently boil until the shells have opened. Discard any mussels and clams that haven't opened. Remove the clams and mussels and any meat in the pot and put to one side. Next throw in the shells from the peeled prawns, add the majority of the saffron (but not all) and the chicken stock cube and bring back to the boil. (Note- this dish gets it salt from the stock cube so don't add anymore, there is more than enough in the stock cube.) In the meantime, separate all the meat from the boiled mussels and clams and discard the shells, put aside the meat until stage 3. Try and do this over a bowl and throw back into the pot any liquid that is left over.

Once the stock is boiling, gently simmer for about 5 minutes, until the stock has achieved a deep yellow colour from the saffron, then sieve out all the stock into a jug or pot, whatever. Discard the sieved shells and keep the stock until stage 3.

==Stage 2 - Base==

In a small pot, add enough olive oil to cover the bottom of the pot, about 4-6 tablespoons, heat through then add the chicken. Cook gently for a few minutes until sizzling then add the crushed garlic, diced onions and red and green peppers. Cook through for about 6-7 minutes until all the onion and peppers are soft and there is a reasonable amount of juice in the bottom of the pot. Reserve to one side. 


==Stage 3 - Paella==

Grab the paella pan and place over the stove or a gas burner. Add the contents of the base to the pan, then the rice, and quickly stir around until evened out. Then pour in the stock (don't worry if theres a bit more than usual, keep this as you may need to add it as the rice soaks up a lot of the liquid.) and add the rest of the saffron. Throw in the squid, the cooked clams and mussels, the small prawns &amp; the frozen peas. Again stir around until even and then layer the large prawns, the mussels and the pickled red peppers and spread out so that it looks something like the above.

Lower the heat right down to a simmer, as low as it can go, and gently let it cook for 25-30 minutes. Try not to mess around with it too much, let it cook on its own but keep a watchful eye over it. Towards the end of the cooking time, I usually take the large prawns out and give it a good mix, making sure the whole paella is cooked through properly, theres nothing worse than raw rice.

Once this has cooked, turn off the heat, place the lemon wedges on top and put to one side for about 5 minutes &amp; cover with a newspaper (try not to get the ink on the paella). Once ready, serve in the pan for a delightful meal for two with a nice bottle of red wine accompanying it, something from Rioja, like Faustino No.V (2001). 


==Variations==

You can use this recipe to create a larger amount of servings if required. You will need a bigger pan though, but just use this recipe as the base for anything larger, just double everything etc but adjust the cooking time for the paella only (stage 3) by about 5 minutes for each increatment in size.

Rice is the most important ingredient in paella. The other ingredients are there to give the rice flavor; add enough to complement it but not so much that they overpower the rice. That said, paella lends itself well to experimentation. Use whatever fresh ingredients are available to you.

The soul of this dish is the saffron. Sold in threads, it is not cheap, but a little goes a long way. You can use “Colorante Alimentario” (food colouring) as a substitute but it is not real saffron and is far inferior to the real thing.

==Ingredients==

* 9 New Mexico dry [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chiles]] - washed, with stems and seeds removed
* 3 [[Cookbook:cup|cup]]s water
* 5 [[Cookbook:pound|pound]]s boneless [[Cookbook:beef|beef]] chuck roast, trimmed of fat
* 1/2 cup all-purpose [[Cookbook:flour|flour]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:tablespoon|tablespoon]] kosher [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
* 1 tablespoon black [[Cookbook:pepper|pepper]]
* 3 tablespoons [[Cookbook:olive oil|olive oil]]
* 1 large yellow [[Cookbook:onion|onion]], chopped
* 2 cups beef [[Cookbook:stock|stock]] or water

==Directions==

#Place chiles and 3 cups water into a medium stockpot, and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and steep for 30 minutes to soften. Strain into a bowl, reserving the cooking liquid. Place the chiles and some of the liquid into a blender, and puree until smooth. Add more liquid as necessary to form a smooth sauce. Pass sauce through a fine mesh strainer to remove any seeds and the tough skins; set aside.
#Cut the roast into 1 to 2 inch chunks. In a medium bowl, combine flour, salt, and pepper. Dredge the beef chunks in the seasoned flour; set aside.
#Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Saute onion until tender and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add beef chunks a few at a time, so as not to overcrowd the pot, and cook until evenly brown. Remove cooked meat, and continue browning remaining meat. Return reserved cooked meat to the pot. Stir in pureed chile mixture. Add beef stock to just cover beef chunks, or to personal preference. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat to lowest setting, and simmer for 3 hours, or until meat is tender. If necessary, adjust with more stock during cooking.

'''Lemon pickle''' is a traditional condiment used with [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] food. Many pickle recipes from India have oil to help preserve the pickle, but this recipe uses no oil.

{{see also|Cookbook:Lemon Pickle}}

==Ingredients==

* [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemons]] - 8 small or 4 large
* ½ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* ¼ - ½ cup of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 4 small green [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chilis]]
* 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Mustard|yellow mustard]] seed
* 1 tablespoon ground [[Cookbook:Mustard|ginger]]
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Fenugreek|fenugreek]] seed
* ¼ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]] powder
* 1 - 2 [[Cookbook:Star anise|star anise]]

==Procedure==

# Cut lemons into small pieces, and place in a bowl.
# Cover with salt and set aside for at least 4 hours (better 24!)
# Chop the chilis finely.
# Dry-roast the yellow mustard seeds, fenugreek seeds, star anise, and chopped chilis on a high heat, shaking constantly - don't burn them!
# Strain the juice from the lemons into a small saucepan, add the turmeric, ginger and sugar, and simmer for 2-3 minutes until the sugar has dissolved. If there isn't enough juice, add a tablespoon or two of water.
# Add the spices and sugar mixture to the bowl of lemons, and mix together well.
# Pack into a pint jar, pressing the pieces in if needed, to ensure that the liquid covers all the lemon pieces.
# Set aside to mature for 1 month.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* If you don't have fresh chilis, add some dried chilis or chili powder. The pickle in the photo has three whole dried chilis in it.

'''Christmas cake''' is a fruitcake traditionally served around [[Cookbook:Holiday Recipes#Christmas|Christmas]] in the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], especially after long walks to be had with tea.

This is a traditional, somewhat extravagant recipe which is quite easy to make, but steeping the fruit should be done over a long time for best results. The resultant cakes should last in very good condition for several months if kept whole in air-tight tins.

==Ingredients==
''To make a round 10-inch diameter cake.''

; The fruit

* 600 g currants
* 400 g sultanas
* 400 g glacé cherries, quartered
* 200 g raisins
* 100 g cut candied peel

* 200 ml sherry
* 100 ml brandy
* 50 ml kirsch (or rum)

; The cake mixture

* 4 medium eggs
* 300 g lightly salted soft margarine (The &quot;Stork&quot; brand is traditional)
* 300 g dark brown sugar
* 100 g self-raising flour
* 200 g plain flour
* 100 g finely-chopped almonds
* 2 teaspoons of ground mixed spice
* 2 tablespoons of black treacle

==Method==

; The fruit

Place all the fruit in a large bowl and pour the spirits over the mixture. Cover the bowl in metal foil and leave in a cool place. Mix and stir the fruit every day for at least three days; after a fortnight most of the alcohol will have soaked in and further soaking has no benefit.

; The cake mixture

First beat together the sugar and margarine with the eggs. Add the almonds and black treacle and mix further. Sieve the flours and the mixed spice into the mixture, beating until a smooth mixture results. Then combine with the pre-prepared fruit (above) and place in a tin lined with baking parchment.

; Cooking

''To be done.''

[[Image:Cubanfood.jpg|thumb|250px|Authentic Cuban dish of ropa vieja (shredded flank steak in a tomato sauce base), black beans, yellow rice, plantains and fried yuca with beer.]]
'''Ropa vieja''', which is Spanish for &quot;Old Clothes,&quot; is a popular [[Cookbook:Caribbean cuisine|Caribbean]] dish consisting of shredded beef (often skirt or flank steak), vegetables, and a sauce.  

The origin of ropa vieja is from the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the Canary Islands|Canary Islands]], which are [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Spain|Spanish]] islands off the coast of North Africa in the Atlantic Ocean. The original version of Ropa Vieja contained leftovers, but later became a shredded meat dish with garbanzo beans and potatoes in the Canary Islands. Some versions in the Canary Islands contain beef or chicken or pork, or a combination of any of the three. Ropa vieja is widely prepared in the Caribbean today. Ropa vieja is listed among traditional [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Panama|Panamanian cuisine]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Cuba|Cuban cuisine]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Dominica|Dominican cuisine]] and Canarian cuisine. 

Below is a typical Cuban recipe, which does not include [[Cookbook:garbanzo beans|garbanzo beans]]

==Ingredients==
*1 kg of boiled [[Cookbook:beef|beef]] (pref. flank steak, but any meat with long threads will do)
*1/3 cup of [[Cookbook:olive oil|olive oil]] 
*1 [[Cookbook:onion|onion]]
*3 [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic]] cloves
*1 green [[Cookbook:bell pepper|bell pepper]] 
*1 red bell pepper
*1½ cup of [[Cookbook:tomato sauce|tomato sauce]] 
*1 tsp of [[Cookbook:salt|salt]] 
*1 [[Cookbook:bay leaf|bay leaf]] 
*1 cup of red cooking [[Cookbook:wine|wine]] or [[Cookbook:beer|beer]]

==Procedure==
#Cut the meat in pieces, not too small, not too big. Using a [[Cookbook:pressure cooker|pressure cooker]], boil the meat for about 15 minutes. Add a teaspoon of olive oil to the water to avoid foaming, also add a teaspoon of salt. After boiling the meat, save a cup of the broth. 
#Shred the meat in thin strips using a fork. Chop the onion, cut the peppers in thin strips and mince the garlic cloves.
#[[Cookbook:Sauté|Sauté]] the garlic and the onion for a bit in hot oil, then add the peppers, sauté a bit more. Add the meat and the rest of the ingredients, including the cup of broth.
#Cook the mix low heat for 20 to 30 minutes. Stir a few times. Season to taste.

These dog biscuits have a bit of protein from peanut butter and some abrasiveness from bran flakes and oats. I use a mostly-oat low-fat granola in place of just the oats and the kind of bran cereal with flax seeds in for some extra texture.

==Ingredients==
*1 beaten [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
*&amp;frac12; cup [[Cookbook:Stock|stock]] (chicken or vegetable)
*&amp;frac14; cup [[Cookbook:Vegetable Oil|vegetable oil]]
*&amp;frac14; cup [[Cookbook:Peanut Butter|peanut butter]]
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Flour|all-purpose flour]] (approximate)
*&amp;frac34; cup bran cereal
*&amp;frac14; cup rolled oats

==Procedure==
Preheat oven to 350&amp;deg; F.

Mix the peanut butter, stock, and oil into the egg until smooth. Mix the flour, cereal and oats together. Add the dry ingredients to the egg mixture until it forms a very stiff dough (you'll need to use your hands at the end. If not very stiff, add flour gradually.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and roll to about &amp;frac14; inch thick. Cut out shapes (bone shapes work well!) and bake on lightly greased cookie sheet in the middle rack for about 15 minutes. Best results are obtained by allowing biscuits to harden overnight.</text>

=Easy Onion Chicken=

===Ingredients===

* 1-1½ [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] canned French-fried [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]], [[Cookbook:Beat|beaten]]
* 4 boneless, skinless [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken breasts]], about 1-1½ [[Cookbook:Pound|pounds]]

===Directions===

# Preheat [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]] to [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|400°F]].
# Crush French-fried onions.
# Place beaten egg in medium wide bowl.
# Cut chicken breasts into halves.
# Dip chicken breasts in beaten egg.
# Roll or dredge chicken breasts in onions.
# Place on [[Cookbook:Cooking Spray|sprayed]] [[Cookbook:Pots and Pans|baking pan]].
# [[Cookbook:Bake|Bake]] 20-25 minutes until chicken is done.

===Tips, Notes, and Variations===

* An easy way to crush the onions is in a freezer strength plastic zip-closure bag, with a [[Cookbook:Rolling Pin|rolling pin]]. You can then just use the bag to coat the chicken breasts.

===Warnings===

* Uncooked chicken should '''always''' be considered contaminated with [[w:Salmonella|Salmonella]]. Handle uncooked chicken as late as possible in preparation, and wash your hands for 30 seconds afterwards.
* By the same token, chicken should be cooked thoroughly, to an internal temperature of 165°F, or until the center is dry and all the pink is gone.

* 1 to 1.25 cups of water per cup of rice
* a pinch of seasalt per cup rice

Wash the rice and soak for a couple of hours or throughout the night.
Cook the rice in a pressure pan. Grind the cooked rice in a mortar, just as long as when the grain is completely fluid and sticky. This will take at least 30 minutes of griding when done by hand. Shape the mash into 2 centimeter squares. Put the rice squares onto an oiled plate and allow to dry for 1 to 2 days. Keep covered in a cold dry room or in the refrigerator. After this, roast the squares for 5 minutes in a pan.

==Procedure==
[[Image:Crem brule closeup.jpg|thumb]]

# Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Before doing so, place a large flat pan with sides on the middle shelf and fill it with ¾&quot; to 1&quot; (2cm to 2.5cm) water.
# In a large mixing bowl, thoroughly mix the dry ingredients, egg yolks, and vanilla extract.
# In a saucepan, heat the cream until it is piping hot (stir constantly), but ''be careful to not let it boil''.
# Slowly (about a cup a time) pour the hot cream into the mixing bowl with the other ingredients, while whisking briskly. If you add the cream too quickly, it will cook the eggs -- a big no no!
# After all the ingredients are well-mixed, pour the mixture into eight individual serving dishes (traditionally ramekins).
# Place the ramekins in the water bath in the oven, and bake until &quot;solid&quot; (like Jell-O). The time depends on the size and depth of the dishes you use, as well as the material of which they're made. Usual time ranges from 25 to 50 minutes.
# Remove the dishes from the oven and allow them to cool. Refrigerate for at least four hours; then cover with Saran wrap and refrigerate until ready for serving.
# When ready to serve, remove the brûlées from the refrigerator and place them on a fire-proof surface. Sprinkle a moderately thin coating of granulated white sugar on the top of each brûlée.
# Using a propane blow-torch, carefully melt the sugar topping so that it forms a solid caramel sheet. Take care to not burn the sugar, or the custard beneath it. ''It is very important that this step not be done with an oven, toaster oven, broiler rack, etc., as doing so will invariably cause the custard to overheat and dry out or burn before the sugar layer on top is properly melted.

==Variations==
* An alternate method for caramelizing the top sugar layer is to pour a very thin layer of liqueur on top and set it alight (essentially a flambé).

'''This is a template page. Please do not add recipes here .'''

This is a recommended template for recipes that are submitted to the cookbook.  Please note that this is only a guideline. Feel free to add more sections, or omit some (although the recipe needs to be useful).

The five dot system is used to represent the relative difficulty of a recipe.  Please keep these descriptions in mind when assigning a difficulty score.
*[[Image:1o5dots.svg|You can boil water, right?]] - You can boil water, right?
*[[Image:2o5dots.svg|Fairly easy]] - Fairly easy
*[[Image:3o5dots.svg|Medium difficulty]] - Medium difficulty
*[[Image:4o5dots.svg|Fairly hard]] - Fairly hard
*[[Image:5o5dots.svg|Are you the Iron Chef?]] - Are you the Iron Chef?

These image pages are useful in that clicking on them brings you to a list of recipes of a particular difficulty.  Note, we borrowed these images from the German Cookbook ([[:de:Kochbuch|Kochbuch]]), which has since been moved to the [[:de:|de:wikibooks.org]] domain, but there still may be a few German language recipes floating around.

Here is a list of sample recipes using the template.
*[[Cookbook:Beef and Barley Stew|Beef and Barley Stew]]
*[[Cookbook:Chocolate Mousse|Chocolate Mousse]]
*[[Cookbook:Tarbes Salad|Tarbes Salad]]
&lt;/div&gt;

===Template for recipe submissions===

{{recipe}} | Cuisine | Type of course

 */ A short description of the recipe should go here;
 anywhere from one sentence to a paragraph or two is
 acceptable.  Describe who uses the dish, and how, as
 well as anything normally prepared with it.  Stories
 of the recipe's creation or other anecdotes are perfectly
 acceptable.
 
 A photo of the completed dish would be helpful, and
 should be in the lead section, perhaps attached to the
 table somehow. /*

==Ingredients==
*1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (240 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) item one
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] (15 mL) item 2
*etc.
*(but '''not on this template page -- make a new page with a new name''')

 */ The ingredients should be listed in the order they
 are called for in the procedure below. The ingredients 
 should be linked to using the &quot;pipe trick&quot;, ie
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Cookbook:carrot|]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, which produces [[Cookbook:carrot|carrot]].
 If optional ingredients and substitutions would make 
 this list less readable, place them in the notes, tips, 
 or variations section instead (if they are specific to
 some different cooking  procedure) or place them in a 
 second list after the first one. Otherwise, simply 
 mark them &quot;(optional)&quot;. Consider using separate lists 
 for filling and shell, meat and sauce, and so on. /*

 */ Quantities should be listed in whichever system (imperial
 or metric) the recipe was created in, with the other system's
 equivalent values listed immediatly after, in &quot;()&quot;.  This
 lets users know which units are &quot;original&quot; and which are
 estimated conversions. Always provide volume measurements.
 In some countries, kitchens are simply not equiped to measure
 by mass or weight. (yes, they lack a balance or scale)
 Do not specify the size of normal chicken eggs; &quot;Large&quot; in
 the USA is similar to &quot;size M&quot; (not size L) in the EU, and
 other countries will surely have their own ideas as well. /*

==Procedure==
#Step one
#Step two
#etc.
#(but '''not on this template page -- make a new page with a new name''')

 */ Photos of the procedures as they are completed should
 be in |thumb| format, so a caption identifying what step
 is being performed can be included in the pic. /*

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Note 1
*Tip 1
*Variation 1
*etc.

 */ This area can be used for any additional information
 that doesn't fit in other areas of the  recipe module. /*

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}}

This variation on a classic cheese-flavored risotto is hearty and delicious. The beer adds a Welsh Rarebit overtone. The best beer is malty, not hoppy. A good amber or belgian ale works well.

==Ingredients==

*&amp;frac12; large [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], diced
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Arborio Rice|arborio rice]]
*1 &amp;frac12; cups hot [[Cookbook:Stock|vegetable stock]] (approximate)
*&amp;frac12; cup beer
*&amp;frac14; cup grated [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|parmesan cheese]]
*&amp;frac14; cup shredded sharp [[Cookbook:Cheddar Cheese|cheddar cheese]] (to taste)

==Procedure==
Heat the stock to near boiling.

[[Cookbook:Sweating|Sweat]] the onion in a heavy, medium saucepan with the olive oil, adding a generous pinch of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]. When the onions are soft and transparent, add the rice, saut&amp;eacute;eing until each grain is coated.

Add the beer and heat to simmer, stirring constantly. When the beer is mostly absorbed, add around a third to a half cup of hot stock (this should be heated in another pan close by). Stir constantly while simmering. Repeat procedure for around twenty minutes--most of the stock should be consumed and the rice should be tender to the taste before proceeding. The rice will produce a thick, creamy sauce in the course of cooking (see [[Cookbook:Risotto|Risotto]]).

Remove from heat, adding the parmesan cheese and stirring to incorporate. Give the cheese a chance to dissolve and melt, then add the cheddar. Stir to melt and incorporate. If a cheesier rice is desired, add more.</text>

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Palestinian Cuisine|Palestinian Cuisine]]

Extremely simple to cook, this dish is a fundamental component of the Palestinian cuisine. It provides carbohydrates, proteins, and a full stomach. It also tastes great.

When cooked with rice, this recipe is [[Cookbook:Gluten-Free|gluten-free]]. It isn't gluten free when cooked with bulgur (wheat).

{{see also|Cookbook:Mjeddrah}}

== Ingredients ==
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] or [[Cookbook:Bulgur|bulgur]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Lentil|lentils]]
* 1 medium sized [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* 4 cups water
* [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* [[Cookbook:Baharat|baharat]]
* [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]]
* [[Cookbook:Cardamom|cardamom]]

== Method ==
[[Image:Mejadrah-cooking.s.jpg|thumb|right]]
The more common recipe uses rice. Bulgur can be substituted for rice, with the exact same procedure. 

# Fry the lentils in oil for 3-4 minutes, stirring continuously, until the first beans show signs of scorching. 
# Add salt, baharat, cumin, ground cardamom.
# Add 2 cups water and cover. Bring to a boil, lower to a simmer. Cook for 20 minutes or until all the water is absorbed by the lentils.
# Fry the rice in oil for 3-4 minutes, stirring continuously, until the grains change colour.
# Add salt, black or white pepper, and ground cardamom.
# Add 2 cups water and cover. Bring to a boil, lower to a simmer. After 5 minutes turn the heat off, and leave standing for another 10 minutes.
# Cut the onion into thin strips (½cm x 4cm).
# Fry the onion in mixed olive oil until crisp and translucent.
# Mix lentils and rice, top with the fried onion.

[[Image:Rainbow-Jello-Full-2004-July-30.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Rainbow Jell-O made from this recipe in a trapezoidal pyrex dish (uncut).]]
[[Image:Rainbow-Jello-Cut-2004-Jul-30.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The same Jell-O, cut and viewed from the end.]]

'''Rainbow Jell-O''' - a multilayered, multiflavored Jell-O extravaganza; based on a recipe from [http://www.kraftfoods.com/main.aspx?s=recipe&amp;m=recipe/knet_recipe_display&amp;u1=keyword&amp;u2=rainbow&amp;u3=**6*6&amp;wf=9&amp;recipe_id=50315 Kraft].

This recipe takes about five hours to prepare, although the time is spent largely in waiting; it is therefore best to plan to intersperse it with other activity and, if they don't mind the constant smell of Jell-O, best done with other people. It yields ten (or as many as you want) layers, alternating opaque and clear, of five colors. (The sour cream or yogurt, used for opacity, cannot be tasted in the final product.)

== Ingredients ==

These ingredients will be divided between the layers of the rainbow Jell-O:

*6 1/4 cups (around 1.5l) boiling water
*5 (or more) packages Jell-O gelatin (4-serving size each; different flavors and colors)
*1 cup (240g) sour cream or plain or vanilla yogurt

== Procedure ==

Select one or more molds. The total volume will be approximately eight cups; a ring mold (as used by Kraft), two or three Pyrex containers (as pictured), or any other assortment should work; for best results, the container should be at least 3in (10cm) deep, allowing for about ten 1cm-thick layers.

*Stir 1 1/4 cups boiling water and one package gelatin in a small bowl for at least two minutes, until completely dissolved. (In practice, it may not quite completely dissolve.)
*Pour 3/4 cups dissolved gelatin into the mold(s).
*Refrigerate for about 15 minutes, until the gelatin sets but is not yet firm: the gelatin should stick to your finger when you touch it. (The aim is for the layers to stick, but not mix.)
*Refrigerate the remaining gelatin for about 5 minutes, until it is slightly thickened (to the consistency of unbeaten egg white).
*Gradually stir 3 tablespoons sour cream or yogurt into the remaining, thickened gelatin.
*Spoon the gelatine on top of the previous layer (gently, so as to maintain a smooth surface).
*Refrigerate again for about 15 minutes.

Repeat the above for each of the remaining flavors. Be sure to cool adequately between layers to prevent melting and mixing.

When finished, refrigerate for about 2 hours, until firm. Remove the gelatin from the mold and place it (probably upside down) on a plate or smooth cutting board. Store refrigerated under saran wrap or aluminum foil. For best effect, serve sliced perpendicular to the layers, so each slice (approximately 1cm thick) displays the full rainbow.

Literally &quot;coffee with milk&quot;, '''cafe au lait''' is a drink made of coffee and milk in a ratio of 1:1. It is the staple coffee drink of French Louisiana and is often served in bowls in [[Cookbook:Cajun cuisine|Acadiana]]. 


==Ingredients==
* 5 Tbsp (70g) [[Cookbook:Coffee|Coffee]] grounds, can be: 
:* Dark (French) roast coffee 
:* Coffee and [[Cookbook:chicory|chicory]] blend 
:* 3 Tbsp (42g) ground coffee and 2 Tbsp (28g) ground chicory, mixed
* OR: 1.5-2 cups (350-475 ml) cold [[Cookbook:coffee concentrate|coffee concentrate]] 
* 4 cups (950 ml) [[Cookbook:milk|milk]]

==Procedure==
# Prepare four cups of coffee in your preferred manner -- drip, boil, seep, etc. 
# At the same time, heat the milk over a low to medium heat until scalded. 
# Pour equal amounts of coffee and scalded milk into bowls or cups. 
# Enjoy. 

==Variations== 
* Steamed milk can be substituted for scalded milk. 
* The milk can be heated in the cups by half filling each cup with milk and [[Cookbook:Microwaving|microwaving]] briefly. A 1,000W microwave oven will heat one half-cup of milk in 50 seconds, two in 60 seconds.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Cuisine of India]]

'''Vindaloo''' is a hot and spicy dish from the Goa region of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]]. Its heavy use of vinegar and the traditional meat of pork are due to the Portuguese influence on the island. Vindaloo is a popular Indian restaurant meal, where it is often made with [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]], [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]], [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]], [[Cookbook:Lamb|lamb]], [[Cookbook:Prawn|prawns]], or vegetables such as [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]].

There are many variations of the vindaloo recipe. Some derivatives use potato, or vary the amounts and types of spices used. Goans scoff at the usage of any other main ingredient besides high fat content pork in vindaloo, because the flavor is very different when prepared with a main ingredient other than pork. Authentic Goan vindaloo is not a curry but more of a dry sauce-based dish, which tastes better as it ages. The authentic taste of vindaloo comes from a unique blend of the fat in the pork, the garlic, vinegar, [[Cookbook:jaggery|jaggery]] and kashmiri chilli (this specific spice is very flavorful but not too pungent). 

Vindaloo is often served with [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]], [[Cookbook:Chapati|chappatis]], [[Cookbook:Naan|naan bread]], or a combination of these. It can also be served with assorted pickles, such as aubergine or lime pickle. Given the spicy nature of the dish, it goes particularly well with [[Cookbook:Raita|raita]].

==Ingredients==
*3 [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] breast fillets 
*2-3 large [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]s
*2 fresh [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chilli peppers]] (I use 1 red and 1 green)
*6 cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
*2cm cube of [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]] (if you don't have fresh ginger use 2 cloves garlic + 1 tsp dried ginger powder)
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbs]] [[Cookbook:Vinegar|white wine vinegar]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] dried [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]]  powder
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Garam Masala|garam masala]]
*0.5 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]] powder
*1.5 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Pepper|black peppercorns]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] black [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]] seeds
*0.5 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Salt|rock salt]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbl]] chopped fresh [[Cookbook:Cilantro|coriander leaves]] 
*half a cup of water

==Procedure==
# '''Make the onion sauce'''
## Take a thick-based [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]], and pour into it enough vegetable oil to cover the base, with a little excess. Heat on a stovetop.
## Slice the onions into fairly thin slivers. When the oil is very hot, add the onions.
## Turn the stove down to a low heat, so the onions just gently [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sauté]]. After around 3 minutes they should be starting to caramelize.
## Gradually turn up the heat and keep stirring the onions. You want them to brown quite heavily without burning.
## Add the white wine vinegar, it will sizzle, and after a while will evaporate. Keep stirring. Fry for several more minutes, until they are very brown, but not burnt.
## Remove the onions from the pan into a bowl, taking care to let as much oil as possible drip back into the pan. You should now have a bowl of nicely crisped fried onions.
## Add the onions to a [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]] or [[Cookbook:Food Processor|food processor]]. Add around 1 tablespoon of oil, and process for around a minute until you have a fairly thick, dark brown sauce. This is the basic onion sauce from which vindaloo is made. It's also the onion sauce that gives the vindaloo the majority of its 'hot' taste, as it builds up as you eat the dish.
## Remove sauce from blender and set aside.

# '''Make the garlic/chili paste'''
## Coarsely chop the garlic cloves (and ginger if you're using it). De-seed the chilli peppers and chop in the same way. Add the chopped garlic and chillies to the food processor. 
## Blend the garlic and chillis until you have a fairly grainy (but liquid) sauce. For this I used an attachment on my blender which is intended to grind coffee beans. It has a much smaller container and so there's less waste.
## Add the turmeric, coriander powder, garam masala and cinnamon to the sauce. Stir it until it's well mixed, and set aside.
## Gently crush the black peppercorns in a mortar and pestle. Once coarse, add the mustard seed and rock salt. Continue blending until all the spices form a nice coarse powder.

# '''Cook the paste and meat'''
## Pour a little oil into a saucepan. Add the spiced garlic and chilli paste to the pan. It needs to be slightly floating on oil, not touching the bottom of the pan.
## When the sauce is quite hot and bubbling, add the chopped meat. Keep stirring so the meat absorbs the spice mix, until it is browned and mostly cooked.

# '''Add onion sauce and simmer'''
## Now add the onion sauce to the pan. After stirring for 1 minute, add a little water and stir for another 2 minutes, then turn the heat to quite low. The sauce at this stage should be quite runny, and orange/tan in color. Remember a lot is going to evaporate off as it cooks.
## At this stage you can add some vegetables. Half a cup of frozen peas works well.
## Place a lid over the pan, and cook for around 30-40 minutes. Keep checking and stirring the pan every 5 or 10 minutes to make sure it doesn't stick or burn.The sauce will darken in color as it cooks.
## Towards the last 15 minutes of cooking time, boil 2 cups of pilau, or basmati rice in a pan.
## To serve- spoon the curry over the top of the rice. Sprinkle the chopped coriander leaves over the curry, and serve immediately.

==Notes, tips and variations==
*Powdered or dried ingredients can be substituted for fresh, but at the expense of taste.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Pizza|Pizza]]

[[Cookbook:pizza|Pizza]] is a traditional [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian]] fare that was introduced by immigrants to America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In America it has evolved to unique variations, including this '''Deep Dish Pizza''' variety. What makes this pizza special is the thicker raised crust which is baked with the pizza. The pizza itself is filled with sauce, cheese and other ingredients. It is served hot from the oven, cut in triangular pieces and served along with a salad and a good red wine, although many in the USA prefer a cold beer. Many in the midwest also call it '''Chicago style pizza'''

This receipe has many variants, which are found at the end of the receipe.    

==Deep Dish Pizza Crust==
===Ingredients===
*	1 [[Cookbook:teaspoon|tsp]] 	active dry [[Cookbook:Yeast|Yeast]] (fast rising yeast is acceptable)
*	3/4 cup	warm water (about 90 degrees F)

*	1 cup 	[[Cookbook:flour|flour]]
*	2 [[Cookbook:tablespoon|tbsp]] 	[[Cookbook:olive oil|olive oil]] 
*	1 [[Cookbook:tablespoon|tbsp]]	[[Cookbook:sugar|sugar]]
*	1/2 [[Cookbook:teaspoon|tsp]]	[[Cookbook:salt|salt]]

*	2 cups	additional [[Cookbook:flour|flour]]
*	~1 cup	warm water
*	4 [[Cookbook:tablespoon|tbsp]] [[Cookbook:cornmeal|cornmeal]]
	
===Preparation===
In a mixing bowl or dough mixer, mix the yeast and 3/4 cup warm water. Let this stand for a few minutes to activate the yeast.

Add and mix the 1 cup flour, oil, sugar, salt into a smooth batter. Add the remaining flour and water. Mix this until the dough has a slightly sticky consistency. Add additional water or flour to adjust the consistency. Mix and knead the dough until the dough springs slightly when touched. 

Let this rise in a warm location in a greased bowl until double. Punch down the dough in the bowl. Pout it onto a floured flat surface. Roll or shape the dough to the shape of a pizza pan and make an edge up the side of the pan for the crust. Roll the dough thicker for Deep Dish Pizza and thinner for a crisper and more traditional pizza crust. 

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F., add the toppings and bake as noted below. 

==Toppings==
===Ingredients===
*	1 or more 6-8 oz. can(s) of prepared pizza sauce, or make your own [[Cookbook:Pizza Sauce|pizza sauce]]
*	1 lb shredded [[Cookbook:Mozzarella Cheese|Mozzarella cheese]]
*	1/4 cup grated [[Cookbook:Romano Cheese|Romano cheese]] (optional) 
*	1/4 cup grated [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan cheese]] (optional)

===Procedure===
Spread the pizza sauce on the dough which was previously prepared, leaving the edge crust uncoated. Add any optional ingredients (pepperoni, sausage, green pepper, etc.). Spread the grated mozzerella cheese evenly across the pizza, leaving the edge crust untouched.  If desired, sprinkle the grated parmesan and romano cheeses evenly over the toppings. 

Bake the pizza in the preheated 425 degree F. oven for 25-30 minutes or until the crust and cheese are lightly brown. If the pizza is browning on the crust and not in the middle, line the edge crust with aluminum foil to prevent burning. This rarely happens except on larger diameter pizzas of 16&quot; or more.   

When removing from the oven, cut into about 8 triangluar, pie shaped slices for serving. A pizza cutter with a crcular wheel does this nicely.   

==Notes, Tips and Variations==
There are a variety of options in the crust, baking and especially in the toppings. The baking of the deep dish pizza described above is a cheese pizza in a round pan baked on an oven rack. 

===Baking Options===
*Use a heated baking stone. This is a flat stone which sit in the oven and preheats to the oven temperature. It accelerates the baking and makes the crust more consistently brown. Decrease the baking time by removing the pizza when the crust and cheese center is light brown. 
*A black pan will cook the crust faster and crisper. 
*Use a professional pizza oven or wood fired stone hearth. This is generally a professional pizza kitchen option.  

===Crust Options===
*Cornmeal is specified to ''flour'' the pan. It provides a unique characteristic to the crust and dries it a bit. It may omitted, or substituted with [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]].
*The olive oil may be substituted by [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]] or [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] for a different crust characteristic or for oiling the pan. Olive oil makes an italian bread type of raised crust. 
*If the crust is left to rise 15-30 minutes before it is baked, it will be thicker and more like an Italian bread crust
*If a mozzerella cheese stick or rolled slice of cheese is rolled and sealed into the outer crust with a pinch of the dough, it adds a unique filling of melted cheese to the otherwise bready crust. Some commercial pizza restaurants offer cheese filled crust. 
*Brush some melted butter on the crust after it has baked. 
*Pinch, slice or form the outer crust into a design before baking, just for the visual appearance. 

===Pizza Pan Options===
*A round aluminum or steel deep dish pizza pan is generally used. It is 12-16 inches in diameter and 1-3 inched deep. Optionally the side removes to facilitate the cutting and serving. See [http://chicago-metallic.kitchen-hills.com/Chicago-Metallic-Professional-Deep-Dish-Pizza-Pan-B0000VLGYI.htm this link for an example.]
*Any flat pan may be substituted by rolling up the crust to form the edges. The edge crust tends to be like an Italian bread and less thick however. A rectangular pan tends to bake uneven. 
*A special wheeled pizza cutter or deep dish pizza pan grip may facilitate handling and serving

===Deep Dish Pizza Optional Toppings===
Consider adding or mixing the following. Many institutions in Chicago will add everything on their toppings option list and call it '''garbage pizza'''.
*1 lb [[Cookbook:Pepperoni|pepperoni]], sliced as thick or thin as one likes
*1 lb bulk (or casing removed) [[Cookbook:Sausage|Italian sausage]] (browned and crumbled)
*1 [[Cookbook:Bell pepper|green pepper]], cleaned and sliced
*1 medium or large [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], sliced or diced
*1 lb [[Cookbook:Beef|ground beef]] (skillet browned and crumbled)
*1/4 cup [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]] (fresh sliced or canned sliced)
*1 lb cooked [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]]
*1 lb diced [[Cookbook:Ham|ham]]
*1 lb [[Cookbook:Salami|salami]]
*1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Pineapple|pineapple]], diced or in rings
*1/2 cup cooked [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] pieces
*1/4 cup [[Cookbook:Anchovy|anchovies]]
*1/4 cup black [[Cookbook:Olive|olives]], pitted and sliced
*any other ingredient

===The Order of the Toppings===
The order of the toppings on the pizza is an option as well. The photo above shows pepperoni placed on ''top'' of the cheese instead of under it.

By changing the order of placement of the toppings, the same ingredients make a pizza that looks and even tastes different. Of course, the crust always is at the bottom for a base.  For instance, these variants will make different pizza styles.
* Chicago Style Type Deep Dish (standard receipe noted above)
** Crust on bottom
** Add the sauce
** Add the toppings (pepperoni, sausage, etc.)
** Add the mozzarella cheese
** Add the grated cheeses

* Boutique Deep Dish (some &quot;upper crust&quot; restaurants do this)
** Crust on bottom
** Add the toppings (pepperoni, sausage, etc.)
** Add the mozzarella cheese
** Add the sauce over the cheese (may require more sauce to cover the ingredients)
** Add the grated cheeses

* Deep Dish Old World Style (similar to photo)
** Crust on bottom
** Add the sauce
** Add most of the toppings (sausage, green pepper, etc.)
** Add the mozzarella cheese
** Add the grated cheeses
** Add pepperoni or other decorative topping

Enjoy and feast on your experiments. 

==Warnings==
* Pizza from the oven is hot. Warn the diners when served. 
* Any meats added to the toppings must be cooked before baking. Raw meat or fish will not adequately cook in the pizza.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Sour mix''' is a mixer used in many [[cocktail]]s, notably the [[Long Island Iced Tea]] family. It is made from approximately equal parts lemon and/or lime juice and [[simple syrup]] and shaken vigorously with ice. This produces a pearly-white liquid with a pronounced flavour. [[Egg white]] may be added as a foaming agent, to improve the texture of the finished product. Pre-mixed versions are available, and are in use in many bars - these typically consist of a powder which must be rehydrated by adding water prior to use.

One of the earliest known printed references to the word &quot;cocktail&quot; described a drink made from &quot;[[Distilled beverage|Spirit]] of any kind, sugar, water and [[bitters]]&quot;. This is very similar to the drink that would these days be known as ''sours'' - a spirit or liqueur, shaken vigorously with ice, lemon juice and sugar.

==Recipes for sour mix==
{{recipe}}
# Whisk one [[Egg (food)|egg]] white in a medium-sized bowl until frothy
# Stir in one [[Cup (unit)|cup]] (~2 dl) of [[sugar]]
# Add two cups of (~4 dl) [[water]]
# Add two cups of (~4 dl) [[lemon]] juice, preferably freshly squeezed
# Stir all ingredients well

Store the mix refrigerated and use within three days of making it.

Alternately, try this &quot;vegan&quot; recipe:
# 2 Parts Lime Juice
# 2 Parts [[Simple_syrup#Simple_syrup|Simple Syrup]] (sugar water)
# 1 Part Orange Juice
# 1 Part Lemon Juice
# Stir ingredients well.

This recipe is not as frothy as the above, but will keep longer and has a great flavor.

[[Cookbook:Rhubarb|Rhubarb]] fool is a traditional desert in Swedish cuisine. Its sweet and sour taste makes it a perfect summer desert, to be served after a heavy meal.

== Ingredients ==
500 g of fresh or frozen [[Cookbook:Rhubarb|rhubarb]]
* 4 dl of [[Cookbook:water|water]]
* 1 dl of [[Cookbook:sugar|sugar]]
* 3 tbs of [[Cookbook:Potatostarch|potatostarch]]
* [[Cookbook:Milk|Milk for serving]]

== Procedure ==
Rinse the rhubarb and cut it into smaller pieces, about 1-3 cm in length. If the rhubarb is coarse or of low quality, it may be necessary to peel it first. Bring the water and sugar to a boil. Add the rhubarb and boil until soft, about 3-5 min. Meanwhile, mix the starch with a bit of water until it dissolves.

When the rhubarb is soft, whisk or stir vigorously to make sure all the rhubarb pieces breaks up into strings. ''There should be no whole pieces left'', if necessary boil some more. Remove the rhubarb from the heat. Add the dissolved starch to the rhubarb while stirring. Keep stirring and bring the rhubarb to a boil once again. Pour the rhubarb fool into serving bowls and sprinkle some sugar on top to prevent skin from forming. Leave to cool off and then refrigerate.

Serve at room temperature or chilled, with milk.

== Notes and Variations ==
Depending on the type of rhubarb and whether it is peeled or not the color of the rhubarb fool can vary from pale yellow to clear red. The [[Cookbook:Potatostarch|potatostarch]] can be substituted for [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]].

Creamed [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]] makes a nutritious [[Cookbook:sauce|sauce]] that goes well with [[Cookbook:fish|fish]] and [[Cookbook:meat|meat]] dishes. In Swedish cuisine it has traditionally been used with boiled [[Cookbook:potatoes|potatoes]] and [[Cookbook:fish|fish]] or with [[Cookbook:chipolata|chipolata]], the Swedish &quot;prince-sausage&quot;.

== Ingredients ==
* 500 g fresh [[Cookbook:spinach|spinach]] (or whole frozen spinach leaves)
* 2 dl of [[Cookbook:water|water]]
* 1/2 tsp of [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
* 1/2 dl of [[Cookbook:cream|cream]]
* [[Cookbook:black_pepper|black pepper]]

'''or'''

* 400 g of [[Cookbook:chop|chopped]] [[Cookbook:spinach|spinach]], fresh or frozen
* 1 1/2 tbs of [[Cookbook:flour|flour]]
* 1 dl of [[Cookbook:milk|milk]]
* 1/2 tsp of [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
* [[Cookbook:black_pepper|black pepper]]

== Procedure ==

Creamed spinach can be done in two different ways. Either with whole spinach or with [[Cookbook:chop|chopped]] spinach.

With '''whole spinach''', first [[Cookbook:boil|boil]] the fresh spinach leaves and the salt in the water for about 5 minutes. If you use frozen spinach, follow the instructions on the box. Note that spinach is high in [[Cookbook:nitrate|nitrites]] which means you may not have to use as much salt as you might think. After boiling for 5 minutes remove the water and let the spinach &quot;dry&quot; for a minute or so. Put the spinach back into the [[Cookbook:Pots_and_Pans|pan]] and add the cream. Boil for a few more minutes and add salt and pepper to taste. Instead of cream the spinach can be quickly fried in about 1 tbs of [[Cookbook:butter|butter]].

With '''chopped spinach''', first boil the fresh spinach leaves as above or gently [[Cookbook:thaw|thaw]] the frozen (chopped) spinach in a little bit of water in a pan. Mix the flour with the chopped spinach in the pan and add the milk. Bring the spinach to the boil and boil gently for 3-5 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste.

== Variations ==
It is not uncommon to add a dash of [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic]] and/or [[Cookbook:nutmeg|nutmeg]] to the creamed spinach. The proportions of milk/cream to spinach can be varied to produce anything from a rich green color to something similar to a [[Cookbook:White_Sauce|white sauce]] with spinach in it, all according to taste.</text>

{{recipesummary|Potato recipes|4|10 min|3|Image=[[Image:Potato_stew.jpg|300px]]}}

Stewing is a great way to take care of left over [[Cookbook:potato|potatoes]]. Potato stew goes well with [[Cookbook:sausage|sausages]], [[Cookbook:meatballs|meatballs]], or [[Cookbook:smoking|smoked]], [[Cookbook:salting|salted]] or [[Cookbook:Gravlax|gravad]] fish.

== Ingredients ==
* 10 leftover boiled [[Cookbook:potato|potatoes]]
* 30 ml of [[Cookbook:Wheat|wheat]] [[Cookbook:flour|flour]]
* 4 dl of [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]], preferably with high fat content (about 3%)
* 20 ml of [[Cookbook:butter|butter]] (optional)
* [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
* [[Cookbook:pepper|white pepper]]
* [[Cookbook:Dill|Dill]]

== Procedure ==
Peal and dice the cold, already boiled, potatoes; make the cubes about 1-2 cm across. Mix the flour with the milk in a saucepan. Be careful to get a smooth mix without lumps; it may help to add just a little bit of milk at the time until a smooth thick substance forms, then add the rest of the milk. Add the butter. For a low-fat alternative, omit the butter. Omitting the butter works perfectly fine but the stew will lose some of its smoothness and luster. Bring the sauce to a boil, add the potatoes and boil gently for 5 min. Add salt, pepper and dill to taste.

=== With raw potatoes ===
Dice the potatoes; make the cubes about 1 cm across. Put the diced potatoes in a saucepan an add milk until it almost covers the potatoes. ''Gently'' boil until the potatoes are soft, about 10 min, stirring occasionally. If the stew is too thin, add some [[Cookbook:Roux|roux]] to the potatoes and boil for a few more minutes. Finally add the dill.

== Variations ==
The dill can be substituted for [[Cookbook:parsley|parsley]] or [[Cookbook:chive|chive]].
Add one or two table spoons (15 ml) of [[Cookbook:Dijon_Mustard|Dijon mustard]] to touch up the flavor.</text>

{{recipesummary|Recipes|3-4|20-30 minutes|3|Image=[[Image:Kedgeree.jpg|300px]]}}


'''Kedgeree''' (or occasionally kitcherie, kitchari or kitchiri) is a dish consisting of flaked [[Cookbook:fish|fish]] (usually [[Cookbook:smoking|smoked]] [[Cookbook:haddock]]), boiled [[Cookbook:rice]], [[Cookbook:egg|egg]]s and [[Cookbook:butter|butter]]. It originated amongst the British colonials in [[Cookbook:cuisine of India|India]] hence was introduced to the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] as a popular [[Cookbook:English breakfast|English breakfast]] in Victorian times, part of the then fashionable [[Cookbook:Anglo-Indian cuisine|Anglo-Indian cuisine]]. During that time, fish was often served for colonial breakfasts so that fish caught in the early morning could be eaten while it was still fresh. It is rarely eaten for breakfast now, but is still a popular dish.
{{wikipedia|Kedgeree}}
 
==Ingredients==

* 1&amp;nbsp;lb smoked haddock (Haddock is traditional. Smoked anything will substitute.)
* 6 [[Cookbook:hard boiled egg|hard boiled egg]]s, chopped fairly fine
* 1-2&amp;nbsp;cups Basmati (preferably) or long-grain white rice
* 2-4&amp;nbsp;cups decent [[Cookbook:chicken stock|chicken stock]], canned low-sodium at a minimum, cartoned organic is much superior, but home-made still beats all comers.
* 1 bay leaf
* Liberal amounts of unsalted butter
* 3 medium [[Cookbook:shallot|shallot]]s, or a medium [[Cookbook:onion|onion]], chopped fairly fine
* As much [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic]] as you can handle, chopped very fine or squished through a [[Cookbook:garlic press|garlic press]]
* At least 3&amp;nbsp;tsp of prepared British [[Cookbook:mustard|mustard]], preferably Colemans (1&amp;frac12;&amp;nbsp;tsp of [[Cookbook:dry mustard|dry mustard]]).
* Enough finely-chopped [[Cookbook:parsley|parsley]] or [[Cookbook:cilantro|cilantro]] to add interest and colour.
* [[Cookbook:Heavy cream|Heavy cream]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]], at the final stage
* Fresh-ground [[Cookbook:Black pepper|pepper]], plenty.
* [[Cookbook:Curry powder|Curry powder]] (alternatively mustard and pepper);


==Procedure==
A [[Cookbook:rice cooker|rice cooker]] is not essential, but makes the whole thing brainless. One cup of rice will yield a dish that is dense with egg and haddock; Two cups will give you a dish with a more Asian proportion of rice. 

#Cook the rice in one and a half the amount of chicken stock with the bay leaf. When it is done and keeping warm, toss out the bay leaf, fluff the rice with chopsticks and place the raw smoked haddock slab on top. Close the lid and let the haddock steam on warm for 15 minutes.
# Remove the haddock, and flake with forks to get rid of '''every last''' trace of bone.  Place the haddock back in the rice cooker.
# [[Cookbook:Sauté|Sauté]] the shallots until light brown, in excess butter. Add the garlic for one minute more, making sure to not brown it. Place it all in with the rice.
# Add the chopped-up eggs, mustard, parsley, pepper, and throw in enough cream to make everything just slightly creamy. Mix it all up, gently and thoroughly (chopsticks are perfect for this). Add salt.
# Serve, now or later &amp;mdash; it keeps well. Leftovers may be served in kedgeree omelettes with a dribble of [[Cookbook:soy sauce]].

This is a simple dish to throw together with leftover meat. I use frozen vegetarian steak strips, though sliced seitan, seared flank steak or any other protein would probably work.

==Ingredients==

*&amp;frac12; large [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], sliced
*2 large [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell peppers]], sliced
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*12 ounces steak strips
*12 ounces crushed tomatoes
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Caper|caper]]s
*7-10 leaves fresh basil
*&amp;frac14; teaspoon salt
*1 pinch red pepper flakes

==Procedure==
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet. Sear steak strips, bell peppers and onion together with salt and red pepper flakes for a few minutes, then turn heat down and add crushed tomatoes and capers. Simmer, covered, for ten minutes or until steak is cooked through and tender. [[Cookbook:Chiffonade|Chiffonade]] the basil and add, simmer for another couple of minutes.

Serves four. Good as a main dish with spinach and garlic and risotto.</text>

'''Moin Moin''', also ''moimoi'', ''moyin moyin'', is a traditional West African dish based on [[Cookbook:Black-Eyed Pea|black-eyed peas]] or other [[Cookbook:Legumes|beans]]. It is usually conical or cylindrical in shape, based on the shape of the mould used to make it.

==Ingredients==
* [[Cookbook:Black-Eyed Pea|black-eyed peas]], or other [[Cookbook:Legumes|beans]]
* [[Cookbook:tomato|tomatoes]]
* [[Cookbook:oil|oil]]
* [[Cookbook:water|water]]
* [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]

===Optional===
* [[Cookbook:Hard Boiled Eggs|hard-boiled eggs]]
* dried [[Cookbook:fish|fish]]
* chunks or [[Cookbook:mincing|minced]] [[Cookbook:beef|beef]]

==Procedure==

# Soak some beans in a large container (some people recommend lightly grounding the beans first to make it easier to remove the skin) for about an hour or so.
# Prepare foil or empty cans for the cooking:
#* If using empty cans, make sure their interior is clean, and lightly greased.
#* If using foil:
#*#Tear off about 1 foot of the foil.
#*#Fold the foil in half.
#*#One of the edges is closed and fine. For two of the other edges, roll them a few times over to make sure they will take the weight of the mixture (at least an inch-worth of rolling).
#*#When you are done, the foil will look like rectangles with only one edge open.
# Rub the beans between your hands to peel the skin off. (The skin should float to the top of the container.) Keep doing this until you have most of the skin off the beans.
# Grind the beans into a smooth, finely-ground, mostly-liquid paste.
# Add blended tomatoes (or tomato sauce and paste), oil (just a few teaspoons), a little salt, and if you wish, you can also add hard-boiled eggs, or dried fish, or meat, or ground beef.
# Place into either the foil or the cans.
#* If using cans, simply pour some of the batter into the cans, making sure you leave enough room for the cooking moin moin to rise.
#* If using foil, pour some of the batter into the foil, and then close up the last edge of the foil (once again, by rolling it securely).
# Place some water in a large pot.
# Place the cans or the foil into them.
# Boil the moin moin until it forms a solid substance (at least half an hour)
# Remove them from the cans or the foil before serving.

Usually eaten with rice, meat, and maybe other sides.

'''Pasta and Bean Soup''' (''Pasta Fagioli'') is a true classical Italian peasant dish, again overcomplicated all too often by highfallutin' chefs. But made properly, with simple ingredients, and maybe let to infuse in the pot for 24 hours, you have one of the most delicious and hearty soups imaginable.

{{see also|Cookbook:Pasta e Fagioli}}

==Ingredients==

*1 large slug of premium [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*1 glass of dry white [[Cookbook:wine|wine]]
*5 cloves of [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic]], peeled and chopped ''(use less garlic at your peril!!)''
*1 [[Cookbook:onion|onion]], peeled and chopped
*4 very red [[Cookbook:tomato|tomatoes]], chopped finely or one tin (235 g) chopped tomatoes
*3 large ''squeezes'' of Italian tomato [[Cookbook:purée|purée]]
*2 235g tins of [[Cookbook:Borlotti Bean|borlotti beans]]
*1 handful of fresh, chopped [[Cookbook:spinach|spinach]] (optional)
*1 sprig of [[Cookbook:rosemary|rosemary]] about 3 inches long
*A large handful of chopped [[Cookbook:parsley|parsley]]
*1 ½ litres [[Cookbook:water|water]]
*2 [[Cookbook:chicken|chicken]] [[Cookbook:Bouillon Cubes|stock cubes]]
*1 pinch of [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
*large pinch of freshly ground [[Cookbook:pepper|pepper]]
*large pinch of [[Cookbook:cayenne pepper|cayenne pepper]]
*5 handfuls of [[Cookbook:pasta|pasta]] shells or penne
*100 ml of single fresh [[Cookbook:cream|cream]] (optional)

==Procedure==

#Heat the olive oil in the pan, and add the chopped garlic and onions and fry gently for about 3 minutes until translucent but not coloured. Add the cayenne pepper and mix well in the pan.
#Add the glass of white wine and allow to evaporate slightly
#Add the water, the stock cubes, the tomato paste, pepper, salt, Pasta and the 2 tins of beans and allow to simmer gently for as long as the pasta needs to cook (see packet) stirring occasionally.
#Once the pasta is [[Cookbook:Al dente|al dente]], stop the cooking process and add the chopped parsley and the cream and stir in well.
#Now add the rosemary sprig and allow the whole thing to infuse for about 2 hours.

==Notes, tips and variations==

* Add a small piece of [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan]] rind to the pot once you have added the water. Take it out once you are ready to serve the soup. Adds a... well... a parmesany taste to the soup!!
* The soup should be quite thick, but if it is not thick enough, take some of the soup out of the pot (preferably excluding any pasta) and blend it. Return the blended mixture to the soup to thicken.
* This soup can be adjusted by the addition of extra beans, extra pasta, to suit your individual taste. As a general rule the pasta should form about 40 percent of the soup !

'''Iraqi Charoset''' is a dried fruit and nut based paste served during the Jewish celebration of Passover by Jews from Iraq.

==Ingredients==
* 500 ml. Iraqi [[Cookbook:date|date]]s, chopped and seeded
* water
* salt
* 125 ml. chopped [[Cookbook:walnut|walnut]]s or [[Cookbook:pistachio|pistachio]]s

== Procedure ==
# Boil dates in lightly salted water stirring frequently until it is a thick paste.
# Mix in finely chopped nuts.
# A traditional variant is to strain the pulp out of the paste producing a honey-like date syrup.  This procedure uses considerably more dates and can take several days to produce sufficient syrup.

'''London Fog''' (also known as Vanilla Tea Misto) is the name of a drink which originated in Vancouver, British Columbia, [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Canada|Canada]], although the creator remains unknown, among several claims. One such claim is from the [[w:Island Coffeehouse|Island Coffeehouse]] in Langley, Washington, a non-profit student run organization, where it was originally made with Peppermint Tea in 2006. However, patrons of Starbucks in Calgary, Alberta have asked for this decadent drink since the winter of 2004. It is common in Washington and Oregon, as well as in the neighboring lower mainland of British Columbia and Alberta, Canada.

The &quot;London Fog&quot; was recently the subject of an investigation on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's afternoon show ''[[w:Freestyle   (radio program)|Freestyle]]''.

== Recipe ==
* 16 oz of [[Cookbook:milk|milk]].  (2% or whole)
* 1 shot of [[Cookbook:vanilla|vanilla]] syrup per 16 oz of milk
* 1 bag of Earl Grey [[Cookbook:tea|tea]]

== Procedure ==
# Brew a small amount of Earl Grey tea. (Add about ½ cup of boiling water to your mug with the tea bag in it.) You are making Earl Grey tea concentrate. Let steep for 2-4 minutes to achieve optimum flavour.
# Heat up Milk.  Preferably you have access to a steamer, or you might be able to ask your local barista for help.
# Add the vanilla syrup. (adjust according to taste)

== Notes, tips and variations ==
* Manchester Fog - steamed [[Cookbook:Soy Milk|soy milk]] with a sugar free vanilla syrup in Earl Grey tea.
* Seattle Fog - soy misto (½ water, ½ soy, steamed) with 2 pumps of vanilla syrup and one pump of [[Cookbook:hazelnut|hazelnut]] syrup, in 2 bags of Earl Grey Tea. Also known as the &quot;No Wang's Special&quot;.
* Sweet Treat London Fog - a sweet, simple, tea-less version of a cold London Fog, which is best served in a punch bowl, consists of chilled ginger ale and copious amounts of either lime sherbet or orange sherbet. As the sherbet melts, it gives the drink a foggy appearance.

== Introduction ==

Basic chicken salad is very similar in many respects to basic [[Cookbook:Tuna Salad|Tuna Salad]], although there are many variations on the dish which can set it apart. Chicken salad tends to work well with sweet fruit and vegetable flavors, and is ideal for lunch-time sandwiches.

== Basic Chicken Salad ==

== Sweet Southern Chicken Salad ==

{{recipesummary|Salad recipes|4|1 hour, 15 minutes|1}}

=== Ingredients ===

*4 skinless chicken breasts
*2 stalks celery
*1/4 cup peppercorns
*2 bay leaves
*1 teaspoon salt
*1 cup mayonnaise
*1 cup mango chutney
*salt and pepper

=== Procedure ===

Add the chicken breasts to a small pot. Add enough water to cover. Slice stalks of celery into large sticks. Add celery, bay leaves, teaspoon salt, and peppercorns to the pot. Bring to a boil. Once boiling, lower temperature and simmer for at least one hour. Chicken should be tender, and should pull apart easily. Remove chicken from water. You may wish to reserve the water as a base for a stock or a soup.

slice chicken into small bite-size cubes. Take care not to shred the chicken, because the salad should be chunky. put cut chicken into a medium-sized bowl. Add mayonnaise and chutney, one spoonful at a time until salad reaches correct consistency. The salad should be moist and chunky, not wet and mushy. Add salt and pepper to taste.

Serve by itself in a bowl, or on bread, biscuits, or croissants. 

=== Variations ===

*Dice a half-stick of celery into fine peices, and add to the salad.
*Add a cut of sliced seedless grapes to the salad for extra sweetness.
*Dice a hard-boiled egg and add to the salad.
*Top with cranberry sauce, orange marmalade, or spicy brown mustard</text>

'''Steamed rice''' is a simple dish but many people have trouble cooking it - being too much rice or too much water.

This recipe for steamed rice is failsafe and does not require special rice cookers or microwaves.

==Ingredients==
*1 part rice
*2 parts water
*Deep saucepan with lid

The universal rule with cooking steamed rice is that the proportion of water should be double that of the rice. If you use one cup of rice you must use two cups of water. If you use two cups of rice you must use four cups of water. 

1 metric cup (250ml, 8.4535 fl oz) is enough rice for three adults.

The rice pictured in the images is Basmati rice - but this recipe works for all long-grain white rice.

==Method==
There is no need to wash the rice but you can if you choose to.

1. Fill cup with desired amount of rice.
[[Image:Steamed Rice How to 01.jpg|right|250px|thumb]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

2. Pour rice into saucepan.
[[Image:Steamed Rice How to 02.jpg|right|250px|thumb]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

3. Pour water into saucepan.
[[Image:Steamed Rice How to 03.jpg|right|250px|thumb]]
Remember - twice as much water as rice.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

4. Stir water so that floating rice sinks.
[[Image:Steamed Rice How to 04.jpg|right|250px|thumb]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

5. Place saucepan on stove and set temperature to &quot;high&quot;. Do not cover.
[[Image:Steamed Rice How to 05.jpg|right|250px|thumb]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

6. Wait until water begins to boil.
[[Image:Steamed Rice How to 06.jpg|right|250px|thumb]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

7. Stir rice again.
[[Image:Steamed Rice How to 07.jpg|right|250px|thumb]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

8. Set temperature to lowest setting. Cover saucepan with lid.
[[Image:Steamed Rice How to 08.jpg|right|250px|thumb]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

9. After ten minutes turn the element off and uncover. The rice is ready to eat.
