	<p>This site was created by <b>Matthew LeVan</b> as a Senior Project in Spring 2008.  
	
	Matt will graduate in May 2008 with dual degrees in Biochemistry and Computer Science and intends to move to
	Arlington, VA with his fiance Lindsay, a vegetarian and avid cook.
	
	This project began over a homecooked meal with Matt's parents and grandparents, who complained about the lack
	of good cooking resources on the internet, hopefully, this site presents a step in the right direction.</p>
	
	<p>Thanks to <b>Chris Stafford</b> for backend work on the information extractor used to aggregate recipes from
	a number of sites.</p>
