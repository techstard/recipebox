This Wiki is designed to facilitate the development of a recipe resource you all will find useful.  Of necessity, it'll be split into two sections
  * "Information I need from you", such as what goes into a recipe and what functionality you want
  * "Information you don't care about", such as the programming details that go into the thing


== Information I need help with: ===
  * [RecipeInfo Things it's useful to know about recipes] 
  * [RecipeSearch Ways you'd like to search for individual recipes] 
  * [MenuSearch What you're looking for in a weekly menu] 

== Programming information: =
  * TBD Once we get some of the above
